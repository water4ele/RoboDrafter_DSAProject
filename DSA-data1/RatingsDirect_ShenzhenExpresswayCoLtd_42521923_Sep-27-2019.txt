Overview
Key Strengths

Key Risks

Dominant position in Shenzhen's toll-road market.

Rising capex on road network under regional development plan.

Strong and sustainable cash flows from toll roads.

Continuous search for toll-road acquisitions to extend the duration of the assets
portfolio.

Meaningful dividend income from the Meilinguan property
project.

Increasing exposure to the more competitive environment-related business.

Property project to provide dividend income. Shenzhen Expressway Co. Ltd. owns 34.3% in United Land Co. (UL),
which operates a property project in Meilinguan with a gross floor area of 486,000 square meters. We expect UL to
distribute dividend income of Chinese renminbi (RMB) 800 million-RMB 1.1 billion per year to Shenzhen Expressway
in 2019 and 2020. However, we consider these dividends as non-core income and exclude from the company's funds
from operations (FFO).

Capital expenditure on toll-road projects to increase. Shenzhen Expressway's total investments on expansion of the
Jihe Expressway and the new Shenzhen-Shantou Second Highway are extremely high due to skyrocketing land
acquisition costs. However, these projects are likely to be funded using a public-private-partnership (PPP) model,
enabling Shenzhen Expressway to earn 7%-8% returns through toll-road operations as the private partner. The
government's capital contributions would be substantial.
Expansion into the environmental service segment has risks. We anticipate Shenzhen Expressway to adhere to its
long-term plan of expanding its environmental service segment so that it contributes 20% of total assets. Potential
growth areas are garbage disposal, industrial hazardous waste, and wind power. As of end-2018, the segment
accounted for 11% of total assets, and profits in the form of dividend income were RMB146 million. These segments
are more competitive than toll roads.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on Shenzhen Expressway reflects the outlook on its parent, Shenzhen International Holdings
Ltd. (BBB/Stable/--). We view Shenzhen Expressway as a core subsidiary of the parent.
The underlying stability of Shenzhen Expressway's performance is due to organic growth of the company's toll
road portfolio, growing contribution from new toll road assets, and phased capital expenditure (capex) on the
Outer Ring Road project over the next 24 months. We also expect that Shenzhen Expressway will be more
disciplined in mergers and acquisitions in the non-toll road business.

Downside scenario
We could lower the rating on Shenzhen Expressway if we downgrade Shenzhen International or if we believe the
company's group status has weakened.
We could lower our assessment of Shenzhen Expressway's stand-alone credit profile if:
• Its FFO interest coverage weakens to below 3.5x for a sustained period;
• Its FFO-to-debt ratio deteriorates to below 15% for a sustained period; or
• The company makes aggressive debt-funded expansion into non-toll road businesses with a majority stake.

Upside scenario
All else being equal, we will upgrade Shenzhen Expressway if we raise the rating on its parent.

• Its EBITDA margin to retreat to 70%-73% in 2019
and 2020 from 80.8% in 2018 due to disposal of
three roads and lower margins in the new wind
segment.
• Net working capital inflow to be RMB1 billion in
2019, and 2020 to see outflow of RMB100 million.
The company has collected RMB600 million in
receivables from UL in the first quarter of 2019.
• Shenzhen Expressway's capex and acquisition
spending to be RMB3.5 billion in 2019 and RMB4.1
billion in 2020.
• Its average cost of debt to be about 4.66%.
• Its cash dividend payment to be RMB1.5 billion in
2019 and RMB900 million in 2020. Shenzhen
Expressway has indicated it will maintain its
dividend payout ratio. Its 2018 profit was boosted by
gains from the disposal of three roads.

Base-case projections
EBITDA to decline despite continued increase in revenue. We anticipate Shenzhen Expressway's EBITDA will decline
by about RMB350 million to RMB4.3 billion in 2019, despite a 4% growth in revenue. This is because the company will
no longer book revenues on the three roads that the government bought back. These roads contributed RMB727
million revenue in 2018. The toll road segment has about 50% gross margin before excluding depreciation costs. We
expect much lower margins on revenues of the new subsidy Nanjing Wind Power (NWP) due to the intense industry
competition and NWP's small operating scale.

Capital expenditure and acquisitions costs are likely to climb. We anticipate Shenzhen Expressway's toll-road
expansion to accelerate from 2018 levels, driven by the need to integrate and upgrade transportation infrastructure in
the Greater-Bay Area. We project such spending to total RMB4.1 billion in 2020, escalating from RMB1.2 billion in
2018.

Company Description
Shenzhen Expressway is 51.6% owned by Shenzhen International and engages in the investment, construction,
operation, and management of toll-road projects. It also operates toll road-related businesses such as entrusted
management, advertising, engineering consulting, and inter-network toll collection.
Shenzhen Expressway is the major expressway operator in Shenzhen. As of September 2019, the company invests in
16 expressway projects totaling 546 kilometers (km) on an attributed basis. As of year-end 2018, Shenzhen
Expressway accounted for 58% of the Shenzhen local expressways, and about 87% of the company's revenue came
from the toll-road business.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
We expect Shenzhen Expressway to maintain its dominant position in Shenzhen city. It will also benefit from
reasonably good traffic growth owing to the strategic location of its toll roads and continued economic growth in
Shenzhen and Guangdong province. The company constructs and operates more than 75% of the total length of

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 24, 2019 8

Shenzhen Expressway Co. Ltd.

expressways in Shenzhen, a city with high car ownership and a vibrant economy.
Despite the affluent home market, steadily growing traffic demand, and dominant local market share, Shenzhen
Expressway is exposed to risks from government asset buybacks and maturing toll roads. Its toll-road concessions are
down to 16 after three were bought back by the Shenzhen government in 2018, and another four are set to expire in
2027.
Shenzhen Expressway has been countering such pressure by replenishing its business portfolio. In addition to
acquiring Coastal Expressway Company, and the Yichang and Shenchang roads, the company also invested in
Chongqing Derun Environment Co. in 2017. Moreover, we anticipate Shenzhen Expressway will obtain concession
extensions from the government on some roads through expansionary work. Despite execution risks and uncertainties
in the traffic ramp-up, or margin compression on new projects, these transactions strengthen Shenzhen Expressway's
market position. The company also appears well positioned in the Greater-Bay-Area integration.

We consider Korea Expressway Corp. (KEC) and Yuexiu Transport Infrastructure Ltd. (YXT) to be Shenzhen
Expressway's comparable peers.
Shenzhen Expressway's road portfolio is most comparable with YXT's. Both companies have a stable and profitable
portfolio of toll road projects. YXT's portfolio is smaller with 12 projects and the company has a shorter total
attributable length. However, YXT's portfolio is more geographically diverse, with six of the seven expressway
subsidiaries located outside of Guangdong province. These contribute 55%-60% of revenue. The majority of Shenzhen
Expressway's revenue is from Shenzhen and other parts of Guangdong province. YXT has a slightly better EBITDA
margin of about 92% over the past three years, compared with 76% for Shenzhen Expressway. However, YXT had a
weaker leverage ratio than Shenzhen Expressway, reflecting its weaker financial risk profile.
KEC constructs and operates an expressway network in South Korea (30 expressways stretching 4,151 kilometer). It
has a stronger business risk profile, mainly due to its dominant market position in the domestic market. KEC has a high
debt level, given its heavy capital investments to fulfil the government's road infrastructure policy. The government's
consistent capital injections over the past few years partly offset the impact. The rating on KEC is higher than that on
Shenzhen Expressway due to KEC's status as the sole government-owned national expressway builder and operator.

Financial Risk: Intermediate
Shenzhen Expressway's huge asset acquisitions in 2017 has increased its financial risk. Nevertheless, the company's
robust cash flows from toll roads and our expectation of disciplined acquisitions over the next few years should
stabilize its financial position.
Shenzhen Expressway spent RMB7.2 billion to acquire the Yichang and Coastal Expressway toll roads and take a
minority stake in Chongqing Derun. It also consolidated RMB4.6 billion of debt from Coastal Expressway in February
2018 after acquiring the toll road in late 2017.
We expect Shenzhen Expressway to be more disciplined in acquisitions to manage its leverage. The company didn't
make any material acquisitions in 2018, and has only invested in Nanjing Wind Power and Nanfeng Group so far in
2019.
Shenzhen Expressway's revenues should increase on the back of its newly invested assets and mid-single-digit growth
in traffic on existing roads. Despite the short-term impact from the government buyback of three roads, traffic should
recover on the back of new roads including the Outer Ring Road and Coastal Expressway Phase II. We expect growing
cash flows from toll roads to maintain the company's ratio of FFO to debt at 19%-23% between 2019 and 2021.

Group Influence
We assess the group credit profile (GCP) of the local government-controlled Shenzhen International as 'bbb'. We
assess Shenzhen Expressway as a core subsidiary of the group and believe the company could benefit from
extraordinary support through the parent if needed. As a result, we equalize the rating on Shenzhen Expressway with
that on Shenzhen International. Our assessment is based on the following factors:
• Shenzhen Expressway is unlikely to be sold because it is a key pillar of Shenzhen International's business strategy.
We believe Shenzhen International will remain the controlling shareholder.
• The group's senior management has a strong commitment of support to the company, as shown from the asset
injections and financial support from the group.
• Shenzhen Expressway constitutes the majority of the group's assets and cash flows, and that is unlikely to change
over the next five years.
• The group's reputation, name, brand, and risk management are closely tied to Shenzhen Expressway; and
• Both companies have operated for more than five years.
