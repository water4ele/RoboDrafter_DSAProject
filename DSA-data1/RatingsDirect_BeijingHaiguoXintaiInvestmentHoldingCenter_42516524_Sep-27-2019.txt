Key Risks

Extremely high likelihood of extraordinary support from the Beijing
Haidian district government.

Persistent high leverage and weak working capital management.

Ongoing government support enhances debt-servicing capability.

Small operating scale with limited business and geographic diversity.
Low profitability driven by inflexible cost structure and weak record
of winning contracts.

Extremely high likelihood of extraordinary government support to remain.Beijing Haiguo Xintai Investment Holding
Center (Beijing HGXT) is the largest and most important government-related entity (GRE) in Haidian district. We
expect the company will receive timely and sufficient extraordinary support from the Haidian district government in
the event of financial distress. Continuous support from the Haidian government in the form of capital injection,
borrowings, credit enhancement etc. since the Beijing HGXT's establishment has aided the company's debt servicing
ability. However, in our view, Beijing HGXT's role and link to the government are weakening, in light of the central
government's long-term policy direction toward clearer separation between local governments and local government
financing vehicles (LGFVs).
Financial leverage will remain very high over the next 12-24 months. Beijing HGXT's debt-to-EBITDA ratio will likely
remain much higher than 20x in the next one to two years due to weak operating cash flow, large capital expenditure
(capex), and high working capital outflows.
Limited service offering and small operational scale remains a constraint, tempered by good brand recognition.Beijing
HGXT's energy and pollution management projects generally focus on chemical purification services, which is a rather
small and niche market. Although the company is one of the leading players in the Chinese domestic market with
some brand recognition, its competitive position remains weak. This is mainly due to Beijing HGXT's limited range of
services, restricting growth in the revenue base.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on Beijing HGXT reflects our view that the Haidian district government will maintain its
creditworthiness over the next 24 months. The outlook also reflects our expectation that the company will
continue to receive timely and sufficient extraordinary government support from the government when necessary.
We anticipate that Beijing HGXT will maintain its small scale and have very high financial leverage while it
continues to rely heavily on debt to fund its working capital and capex.

Downside scenario
We may downgrade Beijing HGXT by one or more notches if we assess that the likelihood of extraordinary
government support to the company has weakened. That could happen if we view the company's role to the
Haidian district government to be less important as it expands into more diversified business and becomes more
independent from the government.
We may also consider downgrading Beijing HGXT if its stand-alone credit profile (SACP) weakens such that the
company faces difficulty in refinancing or servicing interest. This could happen if the company ceases to receive
government support, such as asset injections or subsidies, or its profitability deteriorates substantially.

Upside scenario
We may upgrade Beijing HGXT if we assess that the creditworthiness of the Haidian district government has
improved significantly or the likelihood of extraordinary government support to the company has strengthened.
We may also raise the rating if Beijing HGXT's debt-to-EBITDA ratio falls below 5x. That could happen if the
company significantly reduces its debt, materially improves its EBITDA margin, and maintains robust revenue
growth.
We see both scenarios as remote in the next 12 months.

Our Base-Case Scenario

Assumptions

• Beijing HGXT's revenue to decline by 5%-6% in
2019, compared with a decline of 8.2% in 2018,
reflecting continued weakness of demand in the
energy chemical technology business. Revenue to
increase by 2%-3% in 2020, driven by the education
and third-party payment businesses.
• The company's EBITDA margin to weaken to 9.5%
in 2019 and 9.3% in 2020, from 10.9% in 2018,
reflecting weak demand.

• Working capital outflow to improve in 2019 to
Chinese renminbi (RMB) 2 billion, compared with
RMB6 billion in 2018, given a likely lowering of
inventory and receivables.
• Beijing HGXT to cut capex in 2019 onward to
control its fast-growing debt as less new projects will
be constructed. Capex to be at RMB900
million–RMB1,000 million over the next 12-24
months compared with more than RMB2 billion in
2018.

Base-case projections
Negative free operating cash flows over the next 12–24 months. We expect Beijing HGXT's revenue growth to remain
subdued due to weak demand. In addition, the company's weakening profitability, and continuous working capital
outflow and capex will weigh on its financial metrics. As a result, we expect the free operating cash flow to remain
negative over the next 12–24 months.
Interest coverage to fall below 1.0x. Beijing HGXT's weakening profit margin, slowing revenue growth, and buildup of
interest expenses should keep company's EBITDA interest coverage under 1x for 2019-2020, compared with 1.5x in
2018.

Company Description
Beijing HGXT is a local investment and financing platform wholly owned by the Haidian district State-owned Assets
Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) based in Beijing. Beijing HGXT is an important platform to
finance key projects and execute policies of the Haidian district government. It also influences other state-owned
enterprises (SOEs) in the district on behalf of the Haidian district government. Its total assets were RMB147 billion as
of end-2018.
Beijing HGXT was founded in 2012 by integrating two state-owned companies in Haidian district, Haidian
State-Owned Assets Investment Co. Ltd. and Haidian State-Owned Assets Management Co. Ltd. The company's main
business operations include primary land development, energy and pollution management, third-party payment,

education and real estate development. Its primary land development mainly serves shantytown renovation within
Haidian district. During the past three years, the company's revenue largely comes from energy and pollution
management business conducted by its listed subsidiary, Beijing Sanju Environmental Protection and New Materials
Co. Ltd. (Sanju).

Business Risk: Weak
Beijing HGXT's small scale of business, limited range of services, weak ability to win contracts, and inflexible cost
structure constrain its business profile. The company's record of receiving ongoing support from Haidian district
government supports the ratings.
We expect Beijing HGXT's energy and pollution management business operated via Sanju to remain the major
revenue (47% of total) and gross profit contributor (50% of total) in the next one to two years. This is in line with
Haidian district's positioning as a science and technology hub. Sanju specializes in the niche chemical purification
sector and has a dominant market share in the domestic industry. However, we believe the company's major target
segment is small in the broad chemical equipment and construction (E&C) domain, restricting growth potential. Sanju's
limited service offering and small scale compared with other rated entities in E&C sector further exposes it to industry

downturns.
Beijing HGXT's other businesses of primary land development, education, and third-party payment are small in terms
of revenue and profit contribution. The primary land development business is mainly for the largest shantytown
renovation projects within Haidian district, with total investment of RMB31 billion. The company expects these
projects to be on sale in 2019-2021 and the proceeds could be used to lower thedebt burden. However, we did not
include the proceeds in our base case due to the uncertainty on the timeline and the amount.
Haidian district's strengths in the form of well-known educational resources, and strong science research and
intellectual properties backed by many top universities and technology companies in China support Beijing HGXT's
education and fin-tech business. The education and fin-tech business are still in the startup stage, and the profit
contributions are limited. However, the company benefits from ongoing government support in the form of favorable
policies in terms of taxes and subsidies. These businesses also differentiate Beijing HGXT from other LGFV, which are
mainly involved in infrastructure and public services.
We expect Beijing HGXT's profitability to remain under pressure primarily due to the company's inability to pass on
rises in its operational cost due to weak market demand.

We consider Qingdao City Construction Investment (Group) Ltd. (QCCI), Chongqing Nan'an Urban Construction &
Development (Group) Co. Ltd. (CQNA), and Jiangsu New Headline Development Group Co. Ltd. (Jiangsu NHL) as the
closest peers of Beijing HGXT.
QCCI, CQNA, and Jiangsu NHL are all LGFVs that fulfil certain functions or mandates for local governments. The
companies benefit from their status as GREs and LGFVs. While these entities focus on different businesses according
to their respective local governments' mandate, they all act as funding vehicles. All these entities are 100% owned by
the related local governments.
All of these companies are very highly leveraged, reflecting their public service business with sizable capex or working
capital needs.
Like most LGFVs, all Beijing HGXT's peers are geographically concentrated, have lengthy working capital cycles due
to extended payments from their customers, and have low profit margins. As a result, their debt-to-EBITDA ratios are
way above 5x and are unlikely to decline meaningfully.
Our assessment of extraordinary government support for CQNA is higher than that for Beijing HGXT, QCCI, and
Jiangsu NHL. All these companies have critical importance to their governments because their services cannot be
replaced by other GREs or private-owned entities. QCCI, CQNA, and Jiangsu NHL are mainly involved in urban
infrastructure development and public services. Beijing HGXT provides more commercialized business.
Unlike other local governments that still have many infrastructure projects going on, Haidian district is rather mature
in terms of public transportation and services. The district therefore does not have many infrastructure related projects
being planned. Instead, Haidian district positions itself as the hi-tech and innovation hub not only in Beijing but also
China.

Financial Risk: Highly leveraged
We expect Beijing HGXT to remain highly leveraged. Ongoing government support through potential capital
injections, credit enhancement measures, and the company's access to refinancing from SOE banks will be important
for its debt-servicing capability in the coming few years. During the first half of 2019, the company received
government advances of RMB5 billion related to shantytown projects. It also obtained liquidity support in the form of
lending and guarantee from the government through Haidian State-Owned Assets Operation and Management Center
of RMB6 billion and RMB16.8 billion, respectively, as of end-August 2019.
Bejing HGXT's financial leverage has deteriorated to 24x as of end 2018 from 17x in the previous year. The steep
increase was mainly due to large spending on shantytown renovation projects. Beijing HGXT will likely receive
proceeds from this project when they are up for sale from the end of 2019, leading to a possible improvement in the
debt-to-EBITDA ratio. However, we did not factor the proceeds in our base-case scenario, given the uncertainty on the
amount and timing.
In our view, Beijing HGXT's debt-to-EBITDA ratio will remain way above 20x and the ratio of funds from operations
(FFO) to debt will be negative for the same period.

Liquidity: Adequate
We assess Beijing HGXT's liquidity as adequate. We expect the company's liquidity sources to exceed uses by more
than 1.2x over the 12 months to March 2020. Net liquidity sources should be positive even if EBITDA declines by
more than 15%.
In our view, Beijing HGXT has strong banking relationships underpinned from its GRE status. It has good access to
domestic bond market and has issued onshore bonds for refinancing. We believe the company's strong association
with the development of Haidian district will continue to support its solid relationship with major state-owned banks.

Government Influence
Our assessment of an extremely high likelihood of extraordinary government support to Beijing HGXT is based on our
assessment of the following characteristics:
• Beijing HGXT's very strong link with the Haidian district government. The company is 100% owned by the Haidian
SASAC. In our view, the Haidian district government is unlikely to reduce its stake in the company. The government
appoints the company's senior management and oversees its strategic and business plan. A significant deterioration
in Beijing HGXT's creditworthiness or a default by the company would greatly affect the government's reputation.
• Beijing HGXT's critical role for the Haidian district government. The company is the largest SOE in Haidian district
in terms of revenue and asset base. Beijing HGXT helps to strengthen the government's strategic position in
technology development and education by supporting relevant SOEs within the district. The company has heavy
responsibilities in public services in Haidian district, including shantytown renovation, water supplies, waste
processing, urban traffic improvement and other municipal services.

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 23, 2019 10

Beijing Haiguo Xintai Investment Holding Center

However, we believe the extraordinary support the Haidian district government provides to Beijing HGXT in the event
of financial distress is likely to weaken, given the Chinese central government's macroeconomic policies to distance
LGFVs from related governments.
We believe Beijing HGXT's role as the Haidian district government's traditional investment and financing platform will
transition towards being an industry consolidator that integrates and supports the technological and educational
development in--but not limited to--Haidian district. At the same time, the company is obtaining more autonomy in
determining its own strategic development plan within Haidian SASAC's authorization. Haidian district is positioned as
a technology and science hub due to its strengths in high tech and education resources. Its rather mature infrastructure
and public services differentiate it from many other local and regional governments that still need to invest heavily in
infrastructure-related projects. As a result, in our view, Beijing HGXT will likely reduce its exposure in municipal
services within Haidian district and expand more into technology- and education-related sectors, which are more
commercial and competitive.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
As of March 31, 2019, Beijing HGXT has a total debt of RMB90 billion. Of this, RMB15 billion is secured debt, RMB48
billion is unsecured debt incurred at the parent company level, and RMB27 billion is unsecured debt at the subsidiaries'
level.

Analytical conclusions
Our issue rating on Beijing HGXT's guaranteed senior unsecured notes is the same as the issuer credit rating on the
company. Beijing HGXT provides an unconditional and irrevocable guarantee to the notes and this qualifies for credit
substitution. In our view, there are no significant elements of subordination risk in Beijing HGXT's capital structure.
The company's ratio of priority debt to total debt is below our notching-down threshold of 50% for structural
