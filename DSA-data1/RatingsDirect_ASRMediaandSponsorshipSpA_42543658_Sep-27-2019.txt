Issuer Description
Italy-based ASR Media and Sponsorship S.r.l. (MediaCo, the issuer) was established in 2014 as part of the business
reorganization of Italian football club A.S. Roma (TeamCo, the parent). As a result, the activities associated with media,
broadcasting, and monetization of TeamCo's trademarks, including sponsorship and commercial ventures, were
separated from TeamCo's core business of managing the football club and distributed to MediaCo.
MediaCo is the A.S. Roma group's main financing vehicle. On Feb. 10, 2015, MediaCo borrowed €175 million under a
floating-rate loan facility due 2020 to refinance TeamCo's existing debt and distribute the remaining proceeds to
TeamCo through an intercompany loan. On June 22, 2017, the outstanding loan--equal to €161.4 million--was
amended and extended. As part of the amendment, the notional loan amount increased to €230 million, and the
maturity was extended to 2022.
MediaCo services its loan through TeamCo's media and sponsorship contracts receivables. TeamCo, in turn, relies on
the distributions it receives from MediaCo to fund its operations.

Bond Issuance
On Aug. 8, 2019, MediaCo issued €275 million of bonds due August 2024 to refinance its outstanding debt and
distribute the remaining proceeds to TeamCo.
In particular, MediaCo applied the proceeds from the bonds issuance together with the balance of cash in the secured
accounts associated with the previous loan facility to:
• Pay transaction fees and expenses;
• Repay the outstanding balance under the previous loan facility (€211.875 million) plus the interests accrued from
the last payment date (June 2019) to the repayment date;
• Fund the secured account up to the required amounts; and
• Advance the rest to A.S. Roma for its general corporate purposes through (a) amounts loaned to A.S. Roma via an
intercompany loan and (b) distribution of a dividend of up to €2.6 million.

SEPTEMBER 26, 2019 3

ASR Media and Sponsorship S.p.A.

In the context of the issuance of the notes, MediaCo was transformed from a limited liability company (società a
responsabilità limitata) into a joint stock company (società per azioni) denominated ASR Media and Sponsorship S.p.A.
The larger quantum of debt, combined with minimal mandatory amortization leaving 92% of the debt outstanding at
maturity, increased MediaCo's exposure to refinancing risk upon the bond's maturity in August 2024. At the same time,
in light of the reduced mandatory amortization and the lower cost of debt, MediaCo will retain less cash and distribute
larger sums to TeamCo. Specifically, the debt service reserve account's target balance reduced to about €9.9 million
compared with €16.6 million previously. Additionally, the amount that MediaCo will need to deposit in the debt
service account ahead of distributions will also reduce in line with the ongoing lower debt service requirements.
On the positive side, the notes pay a fixed interest rate, which provides greater visibility on debt service compared to
the floating rate payable under the previous loan facility.
As a result, MediaCo's stand-alone creditworthiness weakened and became less resilient to any cash volatility that may
arise from the on-pitch performance of A.S. Roma's first team or from media and sponsorship contracts renegotiations.
We now assess MediaCo's preliminary stand-alone credit profile (SACP) at 'bb-', in line with the constraint posed by
TeamCo's creditworthiness.

Credit Highlights
Overview
Key strengths

Key risks

A.S. Roma has a long track record of participation in Serie A, Italian
football's top division.

A.S. Roma's first team on-pitch performance has a significant effect on
MediaCo's cash flows.

The global A.S. Roma brand represents MediaCo's key business asset.

MediaCo's ability to repay its debt is somewhat dependent on
TeamCo's operations and financial conditions.

MediaCo has a structurally senior position to the majority of A.S.
Roma's financial and operational expenses, including players' salaries.

The notes issued are exposed to substantially higher refinancing risk.
The debt issuance benefits from weaker liquidity.
Due to Italian law, the creation and perfection of security interests is
more challenging compared to most secured financings we rate.

A.S. Roma's participation in Serie A, Italian football's top division, provides MediaCo with a solid revenue base. A.S.
Roma is a leading Italian football club founded in 1927. Since then, it has participated in all Serie A seasons, with the
exception of a one-year relegation to Serie B at the end of the 1950-1951 season. As long as TeamCo continues to
compete in Serie A, we expect that MediaCo will have access to a moderately stable share of the revenue from the sale
of Serie A's broadcasting rights. Serie A generates the third-highest broadcasting revenue among European domestic
football leagues, behind England and Spain.
The global A.S. Roma brand supports sponsorship revenue and mitigates short-term contract renewal risk.MediaCo
owns the "A.S. Roma" trademarks, providing creditors with some protection if its parent, TeamCo, were to enter a
financial distress scenario. Within Serie A, A.S. Roma is one of the most popular teams, making the A.S. Roma brand
one of the most recognizable and valuable. The club's current main sponsors include Qatar Airways Group (not rated),
Hyundai (BBB+/Stable/-), and Nike (AA-/Stable/A-1+). With the exception of technical sponsorship, these contracts
tend to have short-term maturities and may or may not be renewed on similar terms. Management's focus on
increasing the club's value, combined with the strength of A.S. Roma's brand, mitigates the risk that such contracts

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 26, 2019 4

ASR Media and Sponsorship S.p.A.

may not be renewed on similar terms. A.S. Roma succeeding on the field of play would further support this risk
mitigation.
MediaCo has a structurally senior position to the majority of A.S. Roma's financial and operational expenses,
supporting its ability to generate strong cash flow. Employee wages--the majority of which are player
salaries--represent the bulk of the operating costs in a football club. In light of the legal and contractual structure in
place, TeamCo pays these using cash flows distributed by MediaCo after its debt service. MediaCo's creditors
therefore rank senior to TeamCo's creditors and have access to the vast majority of the revenue originated by
TeamCo.
A.S. Roma's on-pitch performance, which MediaCo is unable to control, exposes MediaCo to cash flow volatility. A
significant portion of MediaCo's revenue entitlement--in excess of 70% in fiscal 2019 (ended June 30)--is associated
with TeamCo's media rights revenue from Serie A and Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) competitions.
Such revenue varies depending on A.S. Roma's on-pitch performance. We consider season results to be inherently
unpredictable and, to a significant degree, dependent on TeamCo's economic resources and investment in players.
That said, Serie A revenue is moderately stable, based on the current allocation method. UEFA revenue is strictly
dependent on A.S. Roma's Serie A ranking in each season and, thereafter, on its progress in either the UEFA
Champions League or UEFA Europa League. Consequently, this revenue is highly exposed to on-pitch performance
compared to Serie A revenue. The commercial exploitation of the A.S. Roma trademark through multi-million-euro
sponsorship contracts, which generated about 20% of MediaCo's revenue in fiscal 2019, are in turn strictly related to
sport performance and especially on the club's international visibility, which it can improve through successful
participation in UEFA competitions. Poor performance by A.S. Roma's first team could adversely affect its popularity,
brand, and ability to attract and retain top players. As a result, being associated with the team may be of less value to
sponsors.
MediaCo's and TeamCo's financial conditions are closely related. MediaCo's structure provides some creditor
protection against the risk associated with TeamCo's operating and financial performance, but it does not eliminate it,
in our view. Specifically, TeamCo's financial health is a pre-condition for the club to be admitted to the UEFA
competitions and maintain its Serie A license. In addition, we think investment in players is critical for the club to
remain near the top of its domestic league on a consistent basis. There is typically a positive correlation between
on-field performance and player investment, salaries, and net transfer spend. Consequently, we think MediaCo's
broadcasting cash inflows and its sponsorship partnerships are somewhat dependent on TeamCo's financial health.
Equally, TeamCo is dependent on the cash flows distributed by MediaCo to pay its operating expenses, mainly players'
and management's salaries, and for general operations. Such an interdependent relationship is unusual in fully delinked
structures, where issuers operations are typically independent from the parent.
The terms of the bond substantially increase creditors' exposure to refinancing risk.MediaCo's €275 bond will not repay
any principal before December 2020. Thereafter the bond will feature marginal mandatory amortization, exposing
creditors to substantially larger refinancing risk at maturity. Approximately €253 million (about 92% of the debt) will
remain outstanding on its maturity date. In contrast, the previous facility left €172 million (about 75% of the original
debt) outstanding on its June 2022 maturity date.
Following the bond issuance, MediaCo benefits from lower sources of liquidity than under the previous capital
structure, thereby becoming more exposed to unexpected revenue shocks.MediaCo's liquidity is less than adequate for a
business that, in our view, has weak visibility on long-term operating and financial performance and relies on access to
additional financing to service its bullet debt. This position weakened following the bond issuance. Due to the cheaper
cost of debt and lower principal amortization, we expect the secured accounts to hold less liquidity than under the
existing facility.

SEPTEMBER 26, 2019 5

ASR Media and Sponsorship S.p.A.

Compared with most secured financing that we rate, the creation and perfection of security interests is more
challenging. Italian law does not permit the grant of security over the receivables arising from future contracts or
arrangements. Therefore, MediaCo and TeamCo will be required to enter into future security assignment agreements
in respect of receivables arising under future sponsorship agreements and media contracts. The recurrent need to
create and perfect security interests under Italian law exposes creditors to an ongoing risk of potential challenges by
an insolvency administrator or by other creditors of TeamCo under the rules of avoidance or clawback of Italian
bankruptcy law. The legal structure in place, however, reduces clawback risks for the issuer's creditors, including
noteholders.

Outlook

The stable outlook reflects our expectation that A.S. Roma will continue playing in Italian football's top division,
allowing MediaCo to benefit from sufficient cash flows to service its new debt issuance and support its refinancing
needs at that point. We also anticipate TeamCo will adjust its relatively high salary bill from fiscal 2019 to
strengthen its operating cash flows in the coming season, especially since the team has not qualified for the
lucrative UEFA Champions League.

Downside scenario
We could lower the rating, possibly by more than one notch, if our view of TeamCo's creditworthiness weakened
or if TeamCo does not fulfill its obligations under the contractual arrangements in place with MediaCo. We could
also lower the rating if MediaCo's stand-alone credit profile weakens. This could stem from a change to the rules
regarding the distribution of Serie A media rights, which would increase revenue sensitivity to on-pitch
performance or result in a lower parachute payment to relegated teams, or if existing sponsorship contracts are not
renewed on approximately similar terms. Additionally, we could lower the rating if the capital structure becomes
more aggressive due to future refinancing or changes in the structural protections.

Upside scenario
An upgrade is unlikely in the near future. This would require an improvement of TeamCo's creditworthiness, which
could occur if the A.S. Roma group generates stronger cash flow, placing less reliance on net player sales to fund
liquidity needs. Additionally, an upgrade would require greater visibility over MediaCo's long-term cash flow
generation supported by contracted revenue. An upgrade could also stem from a substantial reduction in the
group's leverage.

Transaction Summary
In February 2015, TeamCo--the listed sports company holding the franchise (titolo sportivo) entitling A.S. Roma's first
team to compete in the Italian professional football leagues--and Soccer S.a.S. di Brand Management S.r.l.
(Soccer)--the operator of A.S. Roma brands' marketing, merchandising, and sponsorship business--made the following
in-kind contributions to MediaCo as a going concern, pursuant to article 2555 of the Italian Civil Code:
• TeamCo contributed to MediaCo its media rights relating to Roma TV--A.S. Roma's subscription-based
channel--and Roma Radio station, the licensing of A.S. Roma's archive content rights, as well as its digital operations

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

ASR Media and Sponsorship S.p.A.

platforms. The contribution includes all licenses, permits, and employees required to exercise the business; and
• Soccer contributed to MediaCo the title to "A.S. Roma" trademarks and its sponsorship business, including existing
sponsorship contracts and the right to future commercial exploitation of the A.S. Roma trademarks through
marketing, sponsorship, and merchandising activities, together with all licenses, permits, and employees required to
exercise the contribution.
Notably, pursuant to Serie A and UEFA regulation, TeamCo could not contribute to MediaCo the media rights
associated with the broadcasting of Serie A and UEFA matches. TeamCo remains therefore the sole full title owner of
the receivables arising from the associated media contracts (known as indirect media rights contracts). To secure such
receivables in support of MediaCo's liabilities, TeamCo and MediaCo entered into an assignment agreement relating to
the receivables arising from such contracts. Under the agreement, TeamCo assigned to MediaCo the revenue from
existing Serie A and UEFA media rights contracts and undertakes to assign to MediaCo future revenue as it arises.
To strengthen the assignment of receivables from indirect contracts, TeamCo legally segregated the indirect media
contracts from the rest of its estate through the creation of a "patrimonio destinato ad uno specifico affare" (PD) in
accordance with articles 2447-bis(1)(a) et seq. of the Italian Civil Code. The PD is not a separate legal entity from
TeamCo. However, its constitution at the level of TeamCo ring-fences the indirect media contracts against the general
TeamCo creditors that will therefore have no actions with respect to, or rights to attach to, the indirect media
contracts and the associated revenue.

ASR Media and Sponsorship S.p.A.

MediaCo's business is governed by, and conducted according to, arrangements it has entered into with A.S. Roma and
Soccer. Most importantly, MediaCo relies on agreements with A.S. Roma in order to receive the proceeds from current
media and sponsorship contracts and negotiate future ones. Furthermore, MediaCo's cash flows are dependent on A.S.
Roma's compliance with Serie A and UEFA regulations and meeting all requirements of media rights contracts and
sponsorship agreements. The key arrangements include the following:
• MediaCo and Soccer entered into a lease agreement under which MediaCo leases to Soccer its going concern
contributed by TeamCo and Soccer respectively. In exchange, MediaCo receives from Soccer a lease payment.
• Soccer, as licensor, and TeamCo, as licensee, entered into a license agreement that regulate the use by TeamCo of
MediaCo's intellectual property rights including the A.S. Roma brands (previously leased to Soccer under the lease
agreement) in connection with its sport and indirect media rights activities. Notably, the direct media rights and

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 26, 2019 8

ASR Media and Sponsorship S.p.A.

sponsorship activities are not licensed back to TeamCo and remain exclusively at Soccer's level.
• MediaCo, Soccer, and TeamCo entered into a services agreement, which requires TeamCo to perform certain basic
administration activities not available internally to MediaCo and Soccer in exchange for a service charge of nominal
value.
• TeamCo and MediaCo entered into a playing and staging agreement, which requires TeamCo to play all matches as
required under applicable football body regulations, to perform any obligations and meet all requirements under
current and future media and sponsorship agreements, and to play substantially all home matches at Stadio
Olimpico or Stadio della Roma, as applicable.

MediaCo's creditors have priority claim over a large part of the revenue generated by the A.S. Roma group. Ahead of
its bullet maturity, MediaCo's bond will be serviced directly from TeamCo's media and sponsorship revenue--close to
70% of group revenue in fiscal 2019--and only after a marginal portion of the A.S. Roma group operating expenses.
TeamCo retains the group's main expenses, including player salaries, and relies mainly on deferred payments and
distributions from MediaCo as well as tickets sales to services its operating expenses and debt obligations.

Performance Update
A.S. Roma's recent weaker on-field performance has not harmed MediaCo's Serie A revenue in fiscal 2019, but it will
weigh on its UEFA competition revenue in fiscal 2020. A.S. Roma ranked sixth in the 2018-2019 Serie A season, after
finishing no lower than third in each of the five previous seasons. Despite the weaker on-field performance and the
change in distribution criteria applicable from 2018-2019, we expect Serie A broadcasting cash inflows to remain
broadly stable, at about €80 million, corresponding to more than 40% of total MediaCo's total revenue in 2018-2019.
This is due to the increase in value of the associated contracts negotiated by Lega Nazionale Pro for the three seasons
starting 2018-2019.
Despite the exposure to renegotiation risk and future changes in allocation, we deem the Serie A broadcasting cash
inflows as MediaCo's most important and stable source of cash to service its debt. For example, even if A.S. Roma
were to finish No. 17 next season out of 20 teams, we estimate that its Serie A revenue would only be about 10% lower
than our base-case assumption of about €70 million on a sustainable basis. However, UEFA broadcasting revenue is
directly dependent on A.S. Roma's Serie A ranking and, thereafter, its progress in the Champions League or Europa
League. Therefore, this revenue is significantly less predictable--about €58 million in the 2018-2019 season, compared
with about €84 million in 2017-2018 and €28 million in 2016-2017.
Due to weaker on-field performance last season, A.S. Roma did not qualify for the UEFA Champions League for the
coming season. Its sixth place finish in Serie A did not initially grant the club direct access to the UEFA Europa League
either, requiring it to play in the qualification round during summer 2019. However, UEFA has banned A.C. Milan from
all UEFA competitions after the club breached its financial fair play break-even obligations. As a result, A.S. Roma
gained entry to the UEFA Europa League, replacing A.C. Milan, on June 28, 2019. We expect MediaCo to receive a
minimum of €12 million from UEFA broadcasting revenue in fiscal 2020. MediaCo is also entitled to payments
depending on games won or drawn during the group stage, and further payments if A.S. Roma then progresses through
the knockout stages. Due to the intrinsic uncertainty of, and reliance on, A.S. Roma's performance, we do not include
additional UEFA revenue in our cash flow forecasts, unless certain.

ASR Media and Sponsorship S.p.A.

TeamCo's improved commercial efforts support sponsorship revenue growth, although short-term contracts entail
renewal risk. Shirt partnerships account for the largest segment of sponsorship revenue, at about 43% in 2018-2019.
Furthermore, the three-year contract TeamCo signed with Qatar Airways Group (not rated) in 2018 makes A.S. Roma
one of the strongest Italian clubs in terms of shirt sponsorship revenue, behind A.C. Milan and Juventus, and in line
with F.C. Internazionale.
Top European clubs have recently experienced an increase in shirt sponsorship revenue, although we assume in our
base case that TeamCo will renew this contract at similar terms. This reflects both the high competition among clubs
to attract sponsors and the inherent dependency of this source of income on A.S. Roma's on-field performance. For
example, in 2018, TeamCo also signed contracts with Hyundai and Betway, who sponsor the back of A.S. Roma's
match day jersey and training jersey, respectively. These deals coincided with a successful UEFA Champions League
campaign, in which the club reached the semi-final against Liverpool. Although these contracts support our view of
A.S. Roma's brand strength, we also note that the Italian government passed the "Dignity Decree" in third-quarter
2018, banning any gambling or betting advertisement in Italian sports. As a result, TeamCo had to terminate its
contract with Betway early, in early July 2019, to comply with the legislation.
The availability of sufficient financial resources remains critical for TeamCo to attract players and deliver strong
on-field performance. During fiscal 2019, TeamCo experienced an increase in personnel costs while revenue declined,
largely due to weaker performance in the UEFA Champions League compared with the previous season. Nevertheless,
the sale of some of the club's players ahead of June 30 allowed TeamCo to fund its immediate liquidity needs.
Based on existing known player contracts, we understand that some of the cost pressure will begin to ease from
2019-2020 season. We also expect TeamCo will seek to calibrate new players' salaries in line with lower revenue in
2019-2020, on account of TeamCo's failure to qualify for the UEFA Champions League.
We expect the club's investment strategy will focus on maintaining a high-quality roster, in line with its ambition and
fan expectations. However, the strength of the group's financial resources remains critical to attract top quality players.
This is necessary to deliver strong and consistent on-field performance, which, in turn, increases the group's ability to
generate revenue. Currently, TeamCo's financial leverage on a consolidated basis is high, in our view, potentially
limiting its ability to invest in top-quality players compared with other clubs. However, we see American-based Raptor
Group, which acquired A.S. Roma in 2011 and remains the main shareholder, as a strategic investor that may continue
to provide fresh capital to support player investments.

Rating Rationale
In light of the legal and contractual structure in place, the issue rating on the €275 million bonds reflects our
assessment of MediaCo's risk profile on a stand-alone basis, combined with our view on TeamCo's creditworthiness to
reflect MediaCo's cash flows dependency on TeamCo's operational and financial performance.
At present, the rating on the debt is not constrained by TeamCo's creditworthiness. However, the parent linkage may
limit potential positive rating actions and spur negative rating actions on the notes.

ASR Media and Sponsorship S.p.A.

MediaCo's Stand-Alone Credit Profile
Following the €275 bond issuance, we assess MediaCo's SACP at 'bb-'.
In our view MediaCo's stand-alone creditworthiness has weakened, mainly due to its more aggressive capital structure
that will increase creditors' exposure to refinancing risk. This is in addition to its materially volatile cash flow available
to service debt over the long term, owing to short-term contracts linked directly or indirectly to TeamCo's on-field
performance.

Business Risk
MediaCo's operational risk is at the higher end of our range of assessments at '11' (on a scale of '1' [lowest risk] to '12'
[highest risk]). This reflects the potential for substantial cash flow volatility after its short-term contracts expire.

Financial Risk
Base-case assumptions
Serie A broadcasting cash inflows (43% of MediaCo's total revenue in fiscal 2019): A significant portion of MediaCo's
revenue is derived from TeamCo's assignment of its share of revenue from the Italian national football body's (Serie
A's) sale of its broadcasting rights. The value of the Serie A broadcasting contract has increased over the years and, on
account of the applicable distribution criteria, TeamCo has historically been allocated one of the largest portions of
broadcasting revenue among Serie A teams. Nevertheless, any reduction in future contracts' value upon each
three-year contract renegotiation, any changes in the allocation of media rights revenue, or poor on-pitch performance
by AS Roma's first team could be detrimental to MediaCo's future receivables. We consider that, following recent
years' growth in contract value, broadcasting contracts might reach a price ceiling. A combination of elevated deal
prices, an evolving competitive environment among broadcasters, and some signs of a decline in the viewership of
free-to-air broadcasters and pay-TV players may deter broadcasters from significantly bidding up prices of future
broadcasting arrangements. As such, we assume that future contracts will be renegotiated on similar terms as those for
the 2018-2021 seasons.
The rules governing the allocation of the broadcasting revenues to Serie A clubs are set out by law. They were
amended from the 2018-2019 season and will be further adjusted from the 2021-2022 season. The changes contribute
to reduced revenue volatility in the event of TeamCo's underperformance by increasing the portion of media revenue
that is divided equally among the Serie A teams to 50%, up from 40%. Although this provides better visibility on the
short-term receivables for MediaCo, the changes result in the reduction of the overall share of performance-based
media revenue from which top clubs, including A.S. Roma, have historically benefitted. We do not expect substantial
changes in the short term; however forecasting medium and long-term changes in law is difficult. As such we assume
that distribution criteria for Serie A broadcasting rights revenue will remain in line with the currently known allocation
criteria.
Despite TeamCo's recent on-field performance, we consider football match results to be inherently volatile and, to a
significant degree, dependent on TeamCo's economic resources and investment in players. In our view, in the long

term, there is no certainty that TeamCo's economic resources will be sufficient to continue operating a
high-performing football team in a market where competition, players' transfer fees, and wage inflation are constantly
rising. As a result, under our base-case scenario we prudently assume that TeamCo's first team will rank seventh in
Serie A over our forecast period.
UEFA broadcasting revenue (31% of MediaCo's total revenue in fiscal 2019): The broadcasting revenue distributed
from UEFA is solely dependent on TeamCo's Serie A ranking and, thereafter, its progress through the UEFA
competitions. Therefore, poor on-pitch performance by A.S. Roma's first team could have a more pronounced adverse
effect on such receivables, compared to Serie A's. Additionally, a strong on-field performance by TeamCo may alone
not be sufficient for MediaCo to gain access to UEFA broadcasting revenue. This is because the number of teams
eligible to play for the UEFA Champions League or UEFA Europa League also depends upon the overall ranking of
Serie A in comparison with other European leagues, and to eventual changes of the access list decided by UEFA.
Moreover, failure to comply with the UEFA financial fair play rules could lead to revenue from participation in UEFA
competitions being withheld or ultimately to the exclusion of TeamCo from UEFA-sponsored competitions. In light of
these observations, and consistently with long-term Serie A ranking assumption, under our base case TeamCo's first
team does not qualify for UEFA competitions.
Sponsorship revenue (22% of MediaCo's total revenue in fiscal 2019): Sponsorship agreements have short-term tenor
generally ranging from two to five years. The largest sponsorship contracts currently in place will terminate in two
years--Qatar Airways and Hyundai--and five years--Nike. When they expire, A.S. Roma's on-pitch performance and
popularity will play a substantial role in Soccer's ability to renew the contracts and negotiate similar or better
economic terms. In the short term, TeamCo is, in our view, well placed to capitalize on its recent on-pitch performance
and the associated strengthening of its brand recognition. As such, we assume in our base case that TeamCo will be
able to renew the existing contract, albeit at similar terms. This reflects both the high competition among clubs to
attract sponsors and the inherent dependency of this source of income on A.S. Roma's on-field performance.
Archive content revenue (2% of MediaCo's total revenue in fiscal 2019): Public television and radio broadcasting rights
for Serie A matches must be sold on a centralized basis by law. As a result, until midnight of the eighth day after Serie
A matches are played, domestic broadcasting rights are jointly owned by Italian national football body and the Serie A
clubs. Thereafter, clubs are able to freely market the archive content of their home matches. Soccer has an agreement
with Sky Italia, thereafter assigned to MediaCo, for the exclusive commercialization of A.S. Roma's archive rights in
relation to matches played in Serie A, Coppa Italia, or Supercoppa Italiana. The agreement expires in 2021 and
generates approximately €4 million to MediaCo. Beyond its expiration, we assume the contract will be renewed at the
same terms.
Roma TV and Roma Radio revenue (2% of MediaCo's total revenue in fiscal 2019): Existing regulation grants
individual clubs the right to enter into direct agreements with pay-TV providers for broadcasting content other than
live matches. MediaCo owns and Soccer operates Roma TV, a subscription-based pay-TV channel, which broadcasts a
variety of A.S. Roma-related content. Sky Italia has thereafter been granted the exclusive license to distribute Roma
TV via pay-TV under a contract set to expire in 2021. Furthermore, MediaCo owns and Soccer also operates an FM
radio station, named Roma Radio, which provides national and international radio streaming. Cash inflows relating to
RomaTV and Roma Radio form part of MediaCo revenue entitlement and totaled €3.5 million during fiscal 2019. Such
revenue is assumed to remain constant.
Operating expenses: MediaCo is, by construct, responsible for a negligible portion of A.S. Roma group's operating
expenses, the majority of which remain at TeamCo level. The cost split within the A.S. Roma group contributes to
healthy annual debt service coverage ratios (ADSCR) at MediaCo, provided that TeamCo has enough liquidity to pay
its operating expenses, including players' and management's salaries. We account for such dependency as part of our

parent linkage dependency assessment.
Taxation: MediaCo is consolidated with Neep Roma Holding S.p.A and some of its subsidiaries for corporate income
tax purposes until June 2021. Pursuant to this arrangement, which is subject to periodic renewal and potential
extension, MediaCo can benefit from tax losses generated within the tax consolidation group. Our stand-alone analysis
assumes MediaCo is directly responsible for its own tax, including both corporate income and regional tax.
Refinancing: MediaCo needs to refinance approximately 92% of the bond principal balance in 2024. In our base case,
we look beyond the bond's current maturity date and assume refinancing via a fully amortizing debt instrument
maturing in 2037. This is 12 years before the expected termination date of the contractual arrangements granting
MediaCo access to TeamCo's media and sponsorship receivables.

Key metrics
• The preliminary operations phase SACP is constrained by our assessment of the post-refinancing period, during
which ADSCRs are lower than before 2024, due to our assumption of a higher cost of debt (interest and debt
amortization) after refinancing, and lower revenue visibility in later years.
• We assess the preliminary operations phase SACP at 'b+', reflecting our expectation that MediaCo will generate a
minimum ADSCR of at least 2.8x after refinancing. Before 2024, we project a minimum ADSCR of 4.6x.

Downside-case assumptions
In our downside scenario, we consider the risk of TeamCo being temporarily relegated from Serie A. This is, in our
view, a low probability event based on A.S. Roma's first team history, but with a high impact. If A.S. Roma's first team
were to be relegated to Serie B at the end of the next season, MediaCo could expect to receive approximately €1.5
million in broadcasting cash inflow plus a one-time parachute payment from Serie A that is currently €25 million, as
opposed to the €80 million it received from Serie A in fiscal 2019. Additionally, in a relegation scenario, many of the
existing sponsorship agreements provide for significant penalties, reductions, or even termination. We therefore also
expect that, while in Serie B, sponsors may exercise their rights to reduce contracted payments where possible and
that they may not renegotiate expiring contracts. In summary, our main downside assumptions include:
• TeamCo to be relegated twice over our forecast period and, in both cases, promoted back to Serie A the following
season;
• While in Serie B, MediaCo will receive approximately €1.5 million in broadcasting cash inflows from Serie B in
addition to €25 million parachute payment from Serie A;
• While in Serie B, sponsorship revenue will generally drop by 50%, with some exceptions.
• Operating costs increase by 50% compared with the base case; and
• A base rate of 6.0% and credit spread of 9.0% after refinancing.

Downside-case key metrics
• MediaCo is able to withstand a short-term relegation scenario in line with our assumptions with the support of its
available liquidity sources, largely owing to its limited debt service obligations under the bond issuance.
• However, after the bond issuance, the substantially higher amount of debt needing refinancing at maturity reduces
MediaCo's capacity to survive a second relegation that will take place in the medium-to-long term, where the
visibility on its contracted revenue is weaker.

• We reflect the resilience to a short-term shock into a one-notch positive adjustment to the preliminary operations
phase SACP. This leads to an operations phase SACP of 'bb-'.

Liquidity
The bond benefits from a fully funded reserve of €9.9 million, aimed to cover the lesser of the peak annual interest
service and half of peak annual debt service. The bond will also benefit from a requirement for MediaCo to prefund the
operating expenditure and debt service accounts, up to defined target balances, before cash flows can be distributed to
TeamCo.
Furthermore, MediaCo features an unfunded risk reserve account serving as a cash trapping mechanism in the event
that ADSCRs fall--or are expected to fall--below 4x due to poor on-pitch performance or inability to get timely access
to receivables from indirect media contracts.
In our view, due to the high potential for cash flow volatility, liquidity is less than adequate.

Parent Linkage Dependency Assessment
MediaCo has been structured in order to provide creditor protection against the risk associated with A.S. Roma's
operating and financial performance. Nevertheless, A.S. Roma's operations are vital to its business, results of
operations, financial condition, and cash flows. As such, it is not possible, in our view, to fully isolate MediaCo's
stand-alone credit standing from that of its parent.
We expect that MediaCo's legal set-up and, most notably, its ownership of the "A.S. Roma" brand and trademarks may
support debt repayment if its parent were to enter a financial distress scenario. However, under such circumstances
MediaCo may be exposed to potential temporary cash flow disruptions that, combined with high leverage and
less-than-adequate liquidity, could make it more financially vulnerable.
Therefore, the rating on the bond is also based on our assessment of TeamCo's creditworthiness. Our current view of
the latter, combined with our recognition of the safeguards that structurally enhance MediaCo's creditors compared to
TeamCo's, also limits MediaCo's bond rating at 'bb-'.
