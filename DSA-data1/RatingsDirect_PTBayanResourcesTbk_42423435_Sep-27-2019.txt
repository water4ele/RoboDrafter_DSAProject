Overview
Key Strengths

Key Risks

Attractive cost position, low stripping ratios, and a
long reserve life.

Single mine and mineral exposure, with sensitivity to fluctuations in coal prices.

Sufficient liquidity supported by cash balances and
available credit lines.

Modest scale relative to global coal producers.
Potential infrastructure bottlenecks at Mahakam haul road and working capital fluctuations
if barging is delayed during the dry season.

Single mine and mineral exposure continues to constrain credit quality. PT Bayan Resources Tbk.'s (Bayan) scale and
scope are small relative to those of rated industry peers. Larger mining peers have diversified ore and mineral
operations in multiple countries, leading to more stable cash flows. We expect Bayan to remain focused on coal
production, sensitive to volatility in coal prices, and exposed to working capital fluctuations in the dry season.
Leverage to stay modest and liquidity sufficient. Bayan's debt repayment and lines of credit will continue to support its
financial position. We believe the company's leverage will remain modest even in a less favorable pricing scenario. We
also expect the company to continue generating positive discretionary cash flow, which, when combined with the
available revolving lines of credit, will provide adequate liquidity and financial flexibility.
Sound cost position and long reserve life to support earnings.Bayan's operations have low average mining costs of
about US$33.3 per ton, driven by moderate strip ratios of less than 5x. The company's Bara Tabang mine site in East
Kalimantan is in the first quartile of the global energy adjusted cash cost curve, and compares favorably with most
mines in Indonesia. The mine's low cost and reserve life of over 30 years provide good potential for profitable growth
in production.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our expectation that Bayan will maintain its current coal production and manage
dividend distributions and investments prudently over the next 12 months. This will enable the company to
preserve its strong debt servicing capability even in a weak coal-pricing environment.

Downside scenario
We would lower the rating if Bayan's profitability plummets, the company departs from its policy of maintaining
low leverage, or its liquidity weakens significantly. A sharp fall in realized coal prices below US$35/ton that is
likely to compress EBITDA per ton to below US$2.5, or severe disruption at the Bara Tabang mine could depress
earnings. High dividends and significant acquisitions along with elevated capital expenditure (capex), such that the
debt-to-EBITDA ratio is above 3x, would clearly undermine Bayan's creditworthiness. An eroding liquidity would
likely be a consequence of underperformance or elevated cash outflows.

Upside scenario
We would raise the rating if Bayan is able to diversify its operations or expand its scale. This would entail the
company making progress on the Mahakam haul road to unlock the Bara Tabang mine production potential or
making targeted acquisitions while maintaining the solidity of its balance sheet and its liquidity.

Assumptions

• GDP growth of about 5% in Indonesia and
Asia-Pacific over the next two years, and about 6%
on average in China and 7% in India, two countries
that are major consumers and importers of coal.
• Coal prices to remain volatile with average realized
prices per ton in the US$42-US$47 range.
• Bayan's coal production of 32-36 million metric tons
(MMT) in 2019, steadily rising in subsequent years
towards 40MMT. Production to be contributed
largely from the Bara Tabang mine.

• The company's average cash cost per ton to remain
relatively stable at US$32-US$34 over the next three
years.
• Its EBITDA to be US$450 million-US$500 million in
2019 and fall to US$300 million-US$400 million
subsequently, largely affected by weak coal prices.
• Its capex to be US$60 million-US$100 million
annually.
• Dividends will be about 60% of prior year's income.

Base-case projections
Soft coal prices could persist. Following 24 months of strong coal prices, prices have declined since the last quarter of
2018 due to persistent oversupply in part from U.S. exports, as well as sluggish demand from China. The slump is
further exacerbated by rising competition globally from cleaner, renewable energy such as wind, solar, and cheap
natural gas. Continued weakness in coal prices could dampen Bayan's earnings.
Production growth could plateau over the next three years until completion of the Mahakam haul road. We expect
Bayan's strong production growth over the past two years to slow down. Production will be capped at about 40MMT
because the Mahakam haul road is likely to be completed only in 2023. The haul road, which is meant to facilitate
transportation of coal to transhipment points from Bara Tabang, is expected to add capacity of about 30MMT upon
completion.

Company Description
Bayan is a coal mining company with assets in East and South Kalimantan in Indonesia. It produces
high-calorific-value coal to sub-bituminous low-sulphur, low-ash coal.
Founded in 2004, the company was listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange (IDX) in 2008. It acquired 56% of
Kangaroo Resources Ltd. (KRL) with its 13 concessions in 2011. In 2018, the company completed the acquisition of the
remaining 44% of KRL. Bayan has operations that focus on five locations, the largest of which is Bara Tabang. As of

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 9, 2019 4

PT Bayan Resources Tbk.

January 2019, the company has combined reserves of 1,181MMT. These are across five Coal Contracts of Work
licenses and 16 Izin Usaha Pertambangan. Bayan has a total order book of 300MMT of contracted sales volumes.
The company produced 28.9MMT of coal in 2018, generating US$1.7 billion of revenue and US$0.7 billion of EBITDA.
In the first half of 2019, it produced 16MMT of coal and reported EBITDA of US$273 million.

Business Risk: Vulnerable
Bayan is likely to continue to have single mine and mineral exposure, and modest scale relative to global coal
producers. The company would also face seasonal distribution and execution risks until the Mahakam haul road is
operational. The low cost position of Bayan's mines temper these weaknesses.
Earnings remain highly sensitive to fluctuations in coal prices. For instance, in 2015, Bayan suspended production at its
PT Gunungbayan Pratamacoal mine because the cost of coal production exceeded prevailing market prices. In
addition, for the first half of 2019, average selling price (ASP) dipped to US$48/MT, down from US$58/MT in the first
half of 2018. As a result, EBITDA in the period fell to US$273 million with production volumes of 16MMT, compared
with EBITDA of US$403 million and production volumes of 14.8MMT a year earlier.
Single-mine concentration may magnify Bayan's earnings volatility. The company's financial success largely hinges on
production at Bara Tabang. In 2017 and 2018, the Bara Tabang mine accounted for more than 75% of production
volumes. Though the company has four other mines, management plans to continue its focus on Bara Tabang, which
should still account for the lion's share of production.
As such, any disruption or inclement weather faced at the mine could affect earnings severely. As this site is inland in
East Kalimantan, it is dependent on barging down the Kedang Kepala river to distribute coal to sea ports. The
transport can be delayed during the dry season. For instance, the company declared force majeure on some customer
contracts due to the low water levels at the Kedang River in the first quarter of 2019. The construction of the Mahakam
haul road, which will address this infrastructure bottleneck, is unlikely to be complete until 2023 due to delays in
obtaining relevant land permits.

Size and scope remains modest when compared to global peers. Bayan's production volumes have been steadily
increasing, from 9.7MMT in 2016 to 20.9MMT in 2017 and 28.9MMT in 2018, and could expand to over 50MMT at
the Bara Tabang mine in the next five years. However, this is still significantly smaller than that of peers such as PT
Bumi Resources Tbk. (Bumi; 85MMT) and Arch Coal Inc. (ACI; 98MMT) as of 2018. In addition, thermal coal accounts
for 98% of Bayan's revenue since 2017. This is unlikely to change in the next five years as the company intends to
focus on the Bara Tabang mine.
Low cost position to support operating efficiency. Bayan's cash costs have declined from US$43.2/ton in 2015 to
US$33.3/ton in 2018 as the company shifted focus to becoming a low-cost producer by developing the Bara Tabang
mine. The Bara Tabang concession has low strip ratios, with a life-of-mine strip ratio of 2.9x. In addition, Bayan adopts
efficient mining techniques unique to Indonesian mining. These entail the use of geotechnical radars, dozer push
mining methods, and optimized road haulage of coal. The company also enters into derivative contracts to hedge oil
prices, mitigating fuel cost, which accounts for almost 30% of its total cash cost. We believe that Bayan will continue to
maintain its low cash cost position with further decline in strip ratios at the Bara Tabang mine as well as the gradual
completion of integrated export infrastructure to facilitate mining operations.

We consider Geo Energy Resources Ltd. (GERL) and Bumi as closest peers for Bayan, given their similar operations in
coal mining, coal quality, and country risks. ACI and Coronado Global Resources Inc. are other peers that we have
included due to comparable ratings. ACI and Coronado have lower country risks due to their operations mainly in the
U.S. and Australia.
Bayan, Bumi, and GERL have similar jurisdiction and mining license-related exposure with operations in Indonesia. As
such, coal quality and type are similar (lower calorific quality, ash, and sulphur content). The price of coal produced by
GERL, Bayan, and Bumi tends to be at a discount to the benchmark Newcastle price, to account for the lower calorific
content. In comparison, Coronado's and ACI's mines offer metallurgical coal that have higher selling prices compared
with thermal coal.
Bayan, like Bumi and GERL, has assets concentrated in one to two mines. In comparison, Coronado has four large
operating assets in the U.S. and Australia, while ACI operates nine active mines in the US.
In terms of production volume, Bayan has a moderate scale of 29 MMT in 2018, compared with GERL (8 MMT) and
Coronado (20 MMT). Bumi (85 MMT) and ACI (96 MMT) are significantly larger.
As of January 2019, Bayan's reserves base was 1,181 MMT under the Australia Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC)
standard. This is a 55% increase from December 2018; the majority of the growth is due to the Bara Tabang mine. As
such, Bayan's reserve base is comparable to that of Bumi and ACI.

Bayan and GERL had cash costs of US$33.3/ton and US$30.8/ton respectively in 2018 and the companies are placed
in the first quartile of the global cost curve, given their calorific value and low strip ratios. Bumi's cash costs are slightly
higher at US$35.1/ton. Coronado operates within the first and second quartile because the majority of its capacity is in
opencast mines, which have lower production costs compared with underground mines. ACI's metallurgical cash cost
is about US$66.9/ton while that of the thermal coal is about US$12.4/ton.
Bayan's ASP of US$58.5/ton was close to Bumi's US$59.2/ton in 2018. This is markedly higher than GERL's
US$42.1/ton, largely attributable to the higher average quality (greater energy content) of Bayan's coal. The
metallurgical coal at Coronado and ACI fetches much higher ASPs of more than US$110/ton, which give higher
profitability. Nonetheless, the weighted average EBITDA/ton for ACI is around US$5.7, given the high volumes of
thermal coal sold. Bayan managed to yield above-average EBITDA/ton of more than US$25 in 2018, compared with
GERL's US$9-US$11 for the past two years. EBITDA margins for Bayan is also the highest among its peers, at more
than 40% for 2018. Bumi is on the weaker end of the spectrum, with EBITDA margins of less than 10%.

In terms of leverage, Bayan is the strongest among its peers, with negligible debt. Coronado's credit metrics, though
commendably strong, could weaken due to its ownership by a financial sponsor. Bumi's capital structure highly
exposes the company to coal prices, because all cash is upstreamed on a quarterly basis to accelerate repayment of its
first tranche of debt.

Financial Risk: Modest
We believe Bayan's leverage will remain modest even in a less favorable pricing scenario because of the company's
sufficient cash buffer and management's prudence toward debt repayments ahead of the due date.
Bayan's cash flow capability has significantly improved in line with the development of Bara Tabang. This has enabled
the company to use excess cash towards deleveraging. Leverage ratios fell materially to 0.2x in 2018, from 10.7x in
2014, with a net cash position since the first quarter of 2018. We project Bayan's annual EBITDA to average US$350
million-US$500 million over the next three years.

Bayan has planned capex of US$400 million over 2019-2023, of which US$270 million is for expansionary purposes
tied to the Bara Tabang project. This would involve development of haul roads, underpass, barge loading facilities, and
other support equipment. The other US$130 million is mainly for maintenance. The company's capex for the first half
of 2019 has been below expectations of US$32 million due to delay in obtaining land permits to start the construction
of a 100km long hauling road from 2021 to 2023. Any growth in brownfield production at the Bara Tabang mine will be
financed by internally generated cash flow, and remains dependent on supportive coal prices, giving Bayan the
flexibility to manage its growth.
We believe that Bayan will continue to adhere to its dividend policy payout of up to 60% of previous year's net income.
In July 2019, the company distributed US$300 million to its shareholders.
With regard to acquisitions, we believe Bayan could look at midsize mines with value of up to US$200 million.
On the back of stable operating cash flows and manageable capital spending, we project Bayan's free operating cash
flows to be US$200 million-US$350 million over the next three years. This would continue to support Bayan's
creditworthiness, with the ratio of debt to EBITDA not exceeding 0.5x.

Liquidity: Adequate
We assess Bayan's liquidity as adequate with liquidity sources likely to cover liquidity needs by over 1.2x over the 12
months ending June 2020.
Bayan's rising cash balances will be sufficient to support its projected capital spending, dividends, and scheduled debt
maturities over the next 12 months. The company has sufficient headroom on its existing maintenance covenant of net
debt/EBITDA of 2.5x. Bayan also has sound relationships with banks, which provided support when the company was
undergoing restructuring in 2015. Bayan's standing in credit markets is generally satisfactory. More importantly,
management has demonstrated its financial prudence by consistent deleveraging as well as by cutting back on
dividend payouts to preserve cash during the years where the company underperformed. However, given the potential
volatility in coal prices and hence earnings, we believe Bayan may face difficulty in absorbing low probability and high
impact event risks with little need for refinancing.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

Environmental and social factors are material to our credit analysis of Bayan. We also consider governance factors,
but view them as less significant.
International and domestic environmental regulations can have major impact on operations and may affect
Bayan's long-term financial metrics. Bayan and other coal producers face risks resulting from the global energy
transition and carbon emission targets under the Paris Climate Agreement. These could lead to a reliance on
internal cash flows for funding due to a less-supportive financing environment. For example, 21 international banks
have stopped direct financing to new coal mine projects. Partially mitigating these risks is Bayan's low sulfur and
ash content coal, which could become increasingly desirable as environmental regulations become stricter.
However, while we view environmental risks as material, they are similar to those faced by other coal mining
companies and are unlikely to affect the rating at current levels.
Bayan has a sound safety record with no cases of accidents. As such, we view social factors as less material.
We view Bayan's management and governance practices as neutral and in line with that of other large companies.
The company has not been subject to any material investigations on bribery or corruption, and has polices against
both.
