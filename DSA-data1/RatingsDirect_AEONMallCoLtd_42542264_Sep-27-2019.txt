A strong position in domestic shopping center development and management, with

Favorable financial indicators with low reliance on debt for a company which develops
and manages commercial facilities

The credit quality of its parent AEON is likely to strongly constrain the rating on AEON Mall Co. Ltd. S&P Global
Ratings believes AEON Mall is likely to continue to be a highly strategic subsidiary of AEON. We hold this view
because AEON Mall's commercial facilities have AEON's stores as their core tenants, which makes AEON Mall integral
to the group's business operation. We expect the AEON group's consolidated financial leverage to remain high in the
next one to two years, due to sagging profits of its retail business and aggressive investments. Accordingly, the group
credit profile (GCP) of AEON group is likely to continue to constrain the rating on AEON Mall.
AEON Mall is likely to maintain stable rental income from its highly competitive mall facilities in Japan. AEON Mall's
domestic mall facilities are likely to continue to generate stable rental income backed by continued high
competitiveness, amid increasingly severe external environment, such as the decelerating economy, consumption tax
increase, and competition with online shopping companies. AEON Mall is likely to maintain a strong position in
domestic shopping center development and management, with excellent ability to develop and manage shopping
malls and with AEON group's high brand recognition. Apparel specialty stores, which is a major tenant category for its
shopping malls, are unlikely to show a recovery. However, we expect the company to maintain up-to-date facilities
and continue to be able to attract customers to shopping malls, by providing, for example, entertaining shopping
experiences.

AEON Mall Co. Ltd.

AEON Mall's financial ratios are likely to come under downward pressure arising from aggressive growth investments.
We expect AEON Mall to continue to make aggressive growth investments. For instance, it aims to open 43 new
shopping malls overseas from 2019 to 2025. This would lead to a rise in reliance on debt and as a result of that, its key
financial ratios, such as EBITDA interest coverage and the ratio of its funds from operations (FFO) to debt, are likely to
continue to deteriorate moderately, in our view. However, even if its growth investments increased beyond our
assumptions by 20%-30%, we believe the deterioration in the company's financial position for the coming one to two
years would remain within tolerances for the current rating.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on our long-term issuer credit rating on AEON Mall reflects that on its parent, AEON. We
expect AEON Mall's stand-alone credit quality (SACP) to remain stable, backed by stable rental income from its
highly competitive domestic mall facilities and its strong financial base.

Downside scenario
We may consider lowering the rating on AEON Mall if we revise downward the GCP for AEON group. We may
consider revising down the GCP if we see an increased likelihood of AEON's debt to EBITDA staying around 4.6x.
This could occur if the company's reliance on debt rose because its investments increased at a faster pace than we
assumed; or if the company failed to improve its retail business's profitability despite a variety of reform measures
taken. We would also downgrade AEON Mall if its SACP were to fall below the GCP for AEON group as aggressive
investments weakened AEON Mall's financial standing.

Upside scenario
Conversely, while the SACP for AEON Mall equals or exceeds the GCP for AEON group, we will upgrade AEON
Mall if we upgrade AEON. Specifically, we may raise our rating on AEON Mall if we see a higher likelihood
AEON's debt to EBITDA will remain below 3.5x on a sustained basis, stemming from steady recovery in its
financial position. This could happen if AEON fully restored its retail business's profitability and, at the same time,
properly managed its investments and debt.

SEPTEMBER 26, 2019 3

AEON Mall Co. Ltd.

Assumptions

• Growth in Japan's real GDP of 0.8% in 2019 and
0.1% in 2020 and that in China of 6.2% in 2019 and
2020 (as of June 2019).
• Implementation of consumption tax increase
scheduled in October 2019 and the government's
measures to ease its impact.
• Annual 5% growth in the companywide operating
revenue, thanks to approximately five new shopping
mall openings per year in Japan and overseas as
well as expansion and renovation of existing stores.

• Slightly faster growth of operating revenue of AEON
Mall's existing shopping malls in Japan than that of
Japan's GDP, supported by sales from specialty
stores, which have been performing well.
• A gradual recovery in profitability as the company
steadily improves profits from its overseas business.
• Likely continued aggressive growth investments in
Japan and overseas totaling ¥150 billion-¥190
billion per year.
• Continued substantial negative free operating cash
flow, despite a steady increase in cash flow from its
overseas business.

Base-case projections
Both EBITDA interest coverage and cash flow ratios are likely to deteriorate moderately. AEON Mall publicly
announced its policy to tolerate a temporary increase in its financial leverage to maintain its aggressive growth
investments. Its financial indicators, such as EBITDA interest coverage and FFO to debt, are likely to continue to
deteriorate moderately in the next year or two.

Company Description
AEON Mall is a major commercial facility developer that develops and manages shopping malls in Japan, China, and
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries. It leases self-developed commercial facilities to specialty
stores as well as to AEON group companies, such as AEON Retail Co. Ltd. The company has securitized a part of its
developed facilities after trusting the managing business of these facilities. As of the end of February 2019, AEON Mall
operated 153 shopping malls in Japan, 27 shopping malls overseas, and 23 urban style shopping centers in Japan. Its
parent company, AEON, directly or indirectly holds a 56.1% stake in AEON Mall. AEON group accounted for 21.7% of
the AEON Mall's operating revenue in fiscal 2018.

Business Risk: Strong
S&P Global Ratings expects AEON Mall to continue to moderately diversify its business base geographically, backed
by improved profitability and active store openings of its overseas mall business. The company will likely open about
four new shopping malls per year for the next three to four years, in our view. This is in line with its overseas mall
business' strategy to capture the market growth in China and ASEAN countries, where middle-income consumers have
been increasing. We expect the company to maintain the strong financial performance of its domestic mall business.
The company has been taking measures to sharpen the competitive edge of its existing shopping malls through
expansion and renovation of stores and to respond to changes in consumer preferences by developing new store
formats. We believe these measures would yield results, supporting its domestic mall business.
On the other hand, we continue to regard some factors as constraints on AEON Mall's business risk profile. These
include implementation risk in development of shopping malls in the emerging countries, where regulations and
competitive environment are substantially different from those of Japan, and high reliance (slightly above 20%) of
operating revenue on the group. Other constraints on the company's business risk profile include a somewhat high
percentage of shopping malls on leased land or in regional cities where economic slowdown continues and still-intense
competition in the domestic retail industry. We also believe the geographic location, ownership structure, and tenant
diversification of its commercial facilities are somewhat weaker than those of the real estate leasing companies with a
strong business risk profile. Based on this, we consider AEON Mall's business risk profile at the lower end of our strong
category.

Financial Risk: Modest
We believe AEON Mall's key financial indicators are likely to remain favorable with continued low reliance on debt for
a company which develops and manages commercial facilities, although aggressive investments have pressured its
financial position. We expect the company to continue to make substantial growth investments under its policy to
tolerate a temporary rise in its financial leverage. Nevertheless, we assume AEON Mall will continue to emphasize
AEON group's financial discipline and strike a balance between financial soundness and growth while executing its
growth strategy. Consequently, we expect the deterioration in the company's key financial ratios would remain within
tolerances for the current rating.
The company continues to access capital markets through corporate bond issuance and strong relationships with
financial institutions, in our view. Although its liquidity uses are likely to remain high due to aggressive growth
investments, we believe AEON Mall is likely to maintain sufficient liquidity sources, which it will use for maintenance
of existing malls and debt repayment.

Covenant Analysis
AEON Mall's debt does not contain material covenants that would have a major impact on its financial activities.

Group Influence
The 'a-' SACP for AEON Mall exceeds the 'bbb' GCP for AEON group. Our long-term issuer credit rating on AEON
Mall is 'BBB' because we do not believe our rating on AEON Mall can exceed the GCP for AEON group. We base this
view on our assessment that AEON Mall is a highly strategic subsidiary of AEON group that is integral to the group's
strategy and operations. As such, it is highly probable that AEON Mall would extend financial support to the parent
company, which has lower credit quality, if needed.
