Overview
Key Strengths

Key Risks

Low-risk, fully rate-regulated electric utility.

Modest customer base and growth.

Generally stable regulatory framework.

Limited regulatory and operating diversity.

About 65% of operating revenues are from residential and commercial
customers, providing some stability to revenue and cash flow.

Negative discretionary cash flow, reflecting high capital
spending leading to external funding needs.

We expect stable cash flows in the coming years, with a consistent customer base of which about 65% are residential
and commercial customers. It is, however, offset by a high customer geographic concentration in a limited service
territory in Eastern Texas.
The fuel mix for the company's 2,300 megawatts (MW) of power generation is about 90% natural-gas-fired.

Entergy Texas Inc.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on Entergy Texas Inc. (ETI) reflects that on its parent company, Entergy Corp. Over the next
two years, S&P Global Ratings' expectation is that Entergy will exit its higher-risk, non-utility nuclear power
generation stations and grow through its lower-risk, rate-regulated utility businesses, leading to an improved
business risk profile. The outlook also reflects our base-case forecast for adjusted funds from operations (FFO) to
debt averaging about 15% over the next few years, in line with the current significant financial risk profile.

Downside scenario
We could lower the ratings on Entergy and its subsidiaries, including ETI, over the next 24 months if the
non-utility-owned nuclear power generation stations, which we currently expect to be closed, remain open and we
anticipate a weakening of its financial measures, including adjusted FFO to debt consistently below 14%.

Upside scenario
Although unlikely given our expectation for weakened financial measures due to the impact of U.S. tax reform, we
could raise our rating on Entergy over the next 24 months if we project that it will improve its adjusted FFO to
debt consistently above 17%.

Entergy Texas Inc.

Business Risk: Strong
Our assessment of ETI's business risk profile reflects its lower-risk, regulated utility operations in Texas, with generally
supportive regulation, including rate mechanisms for T&D cost recovery. Following hurricanes, the company has been
able to recover storm costs through securitizations after a lag. The company's midsize service territory benefits from
economic growth and modest customer growth. ETI, with about 10% of Entergy's consolidated operating income,
serves approximately 440,000 customers in eastern Texas and has about 2,300 MW of capacity, of which about 90% is
natural-gas-fired. Residential and commercial customers account for about 65% of retail sales, providing some stability
to revenue and cash flow. Overall, we assess ETI at the higher end of its business risk profile category.

Financial Risk: Aggressive
Our assessment of ETI's stand-alone financial risk profile incorporates a base-case scenario that includes adjusted FFO
to debt averaging about 10%, below the midpoint of the benchmark range of the aggressive financial risk category. We
expect the supplemental ratio of FFO cash interest coverage to be 2.5x-3.5x, supporting our financial risk assessment.
In addition, we expect robust capital spending along with dividend payments to result in negative DCF. The utility will
therefore require external funding that could include debt issuances or capital infusions from the Entergy group. Over
the next few years, we expect debt to be highly leveraged for a regulated utility, as indicated by debt to EBITDA
averaging about 6.5x. We assess ETI's financial risk under our medial volatility financial benchmarks, reflecting the
company's lower-risk regulated utility operations and effective management of regulatory risk. These benchmarks are
more relaxed than those used for a typical corporate issuer.

Liquidity: Adequate
We assess the company's stand-alone liquidity as adequate because we believe its liquidity sources are likely to cover
uses by more than 1.1x over the next 12 months and meet cash outflows even with a 10% decline in EBITDA. The
assessment also reflects the company's generally prudent risk management, sound relationships with banks, and a
generally satisfactory standing in credit markets.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Cash and liquid investments of about $20 million;

• Capital spending of about $565 million

• Estimated cash FFO of about $300 million;
• Credit facility availability of about $150 million;
• Working-capital inflows of about $50 million; and
• Group support through capital infusions of about
$100 million.

Debt maturities
2019: $500 million
2020: nil
2021: $200 million
2022: $81.2 million
2023: $203.6 million
Thereafter: $528.9 million

Entergy Texas Inc.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

We consider environmental factors in our rating analysis. ETI's social and governance factors are generally
comparable with those of its peers.
As both a vertically integrated electric utility with generation assets and a natural gas distribution utility, ETI has
similar environmental risks to those of its vertically integrated peers and Entergy, which has about 21,000 MW of
generation that consists of 65% natural gas, 25% nuclear, and about 10% coal.
Entergy continues to decarbonize its portfolio with wind generation investments. The company plans to have 1,000
MW of renewable energy resources by 2020, including through power purchase agreements in Arkansas and
Louisiana. By pursuing greater renewables generation, the company is meeting its customers' demand for
renewable energy.
Social and governance factors are in line with those of other utility companies.

Group Influence
Under our group rating methodology, we consider ETI to be a core subsidiary of its parent Entergy, reflecting our view
that it is highly unlikely to be sold, is integral to the overall group strategy, possesses a strong long-term commitment
from senior management, and is closely linked to the parent's name and reputation. We assess ETI's issuer credit
rating to be in line with Entergy's group credit profile of 'bbb+'.

Issue Ratings - Recovery Analysis
ETI's first mortgage bonds benefit from a first-priority lien on substantially all of the utility's real property owned or
subsequently acquired. Collateral coverage of more than 1.5x supports a recovery rating of '1+' and an issue rating of
two notches above the issuer credit rating.

To the extent that regulatory authorities allow a rating agency to acknowledge in one jurisdiction a rating issued in another jurisdiction for certain regulatory purposes, S&P
reserves the right to assign, withdraw or suspend such acknowledgment at any time and in its sole discretion. S&P Parties disclaim any duty whatsoever arising out of the
assignment, withdrawal or suspension of an acknowledgment as well as any liability for any damage alleged to have been suffered on account thereof.
S&P keeps certain activities of its business units separate from each other in order to preserve the independence and objectivity of their respective activities. As a result,
certain business units of S&P may have information that is not available to other S&P business units. S&P has established policies and procedures to maintain the
confidentiality of certain non-public information received in connection with each analytical process.
S&P may receive compensation for its ratings and certain analyses, normally from issuers or underwriters of securities or from obligors. S&P reserves the right to disseminate
its opinions and analyses. S&P's public ratings and analyses are made available on its Web sites, www.standardandpoors.com (free of charge), and www.ratingsdirect.com
(subscription), and may be distributed through other means, including via S&P publications and third-party redistributors. Additional information about our ratings fees is
