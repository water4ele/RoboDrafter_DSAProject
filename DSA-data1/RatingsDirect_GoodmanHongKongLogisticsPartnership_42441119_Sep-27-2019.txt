Overview
Key Strengths

Key Risks

Strong market position in logistics and industrial properties in
Hong Kong.

Elevated leverage for the next one to two years due to development
spending.

Good funding track record and prudent financial management.

Moderate scale with shorter average lease maturity profile than that of
international peers.

Stable cash flow generation from moderate rental rate growth.

Geographic and asset concentration in the logistics and warehouse sector in
Hong Kong.

Good asset quality underpinned by tenant diversity and low
vacancy rates.

Exposure to lumpy and sizable development that distorts cash flow.

We expect new development capex to keep leverage elevated over the next one to two years. Goodman Hong Kong
Logistics Partnership's (BBB+/Stable/--) debt-to-EBITDA ratio jumped from 4.9x in FY2018 to 7.4x in FY2019,mainly
driven by the Tuen Mun site acquisition and the land premium payment to convert Tsuen Wan West Building 1 to a
data center. We expect GHKLP's leverage to remain elevated due to these two new developments, although the
company will partially fund them by raising equity--which will temper the rising leverage.
Strong support from existing shareholders to help the company maintain a prudent capital structure.The company has
a track record of funding new developments with a mix of debt and equity, which is consistent with its financial
policies. Shareholders have shown strong support and willingness to fund the Tuen Mun and Tsuen Wan West
Building 1 projects with new equity and dividend retention for the next two to three years, totaling about Hong Kong
dollar (HK$) 3.9 billion of equity funding. In addition, we expect the fund to have a balanced mix of equity and debt
financing to support future development capital expenditure (capex) for the remaining Tsuen Wan West buildings.
Good track record of securing quality tenant to mitigate the project risk for new developments: We believe the fund will
be able to find suitable tenants for its new developments of Tuen Mun and Tsuen Wan West. The company has a good
track record of securing quality tenants. For the upcoming Tsuen Wan West Building 1, the partnership has already
entered into a precommitment with a leading global data center operator for a 15-year lease term. GHKLP has started
to have pre-leasing discussions with potential tenants for the Tuen Mun project. We believe the company has a good
track record in securing tenants prior to completion.

Moderate income growth underpinned by tight warehouse supply along with strong tenant base and good asset quality.
We anticipate rental income to continue to grow by 4%-5% annually in the next 12-24 months. Warehouse vacancy
rates in Hong Kong have dropped sharply from 5.2% in 2017 to 1.4% as of June 2019. Tight warehouse supply along
with stable demand condition supported the positive rental revision. In addition, the asset quality is well-located with
the majority of the assets in the city's prime port zone.

Outlook

The stable outlook for the next 24 months reflects our expectation that GHKLP will maintain recurring and stable
cash flows. Our view is underpinned by the fund's high occupancy and positive rental reversions (or higher rents on
lease expiry) from a high-quality portfolio of modern warehouses. We expect GHKLP's leverage to increase over
the next two years because of growing capex to develop a new logistics site.
Nonetheless, we believe shareholders will continue to provide equity support for new developments and GHKLP
will maintain a prudent capital structure to moderate its financial leverage.

Downside scenario
Downward pressure on the rating could occur if GHKLP adopts a faster pace of development and higher capex that
is inconsistent with its operating strategy, weakening its financial risk profile. We could lower the rating if the
debt-to-EBITDA ratio is greater than 7.5x or EBITDA interest coverage less than 3x.

Upside scenario
A rating uplift is unlikely over the next 24 months, given GHKLP's rising leverage and the fund's upper target of a
35% debt-to-asset ratio, from about 16.5% currently. However, we may upgrade GHKLP if it adopts more
conservative financial policies, supported by a significant and sustainable improvement in financial metrics.

Assumptions

• Hong Kong's GDP growth is expected to slow down
to 2.2% in 2019, 2.4% in 2020, and 2.5% in 2021
from 3.0% in 2018.
• Rental growth is expected to be strong amid limited
supply of new industrial land in Hong Kong and very
low warehouse vacancy rates.
• Retail sales growth expected to be challenging in
2019 amid trade war tension and political unrest.

• GHKLP will maintain a high-quality portfolio to
support good cash flow generation.
• Rental income growth is expected to remain strong,
growing by 4.0%-5.0% per year in the next 12-24
months.
• Occupancy rate expected to remain high at
98.0%-99.0%, similar to fiscals 2018-2019.
• Gross margins expected to remain stable at
86.0%-87.0%.
• Development capex expected to be HK$1 billion to
HK$1.5 billion in fiscals 2020-2021 (ending March),
mainly driven by the development expenditure for
Tuen Mun and Tsuen Wan West Building 1 projects.
• Maintenance capex expected to be HK$60.0
million-HK$70.0 million for the next three years.
• Performance fee of about HK$2.5 billion to be paid
in fiscal 2021.
• New equity infusion and dividend retention of
HK$3.9 billion in fiscal 2020.
• Average funding cost of about 4.0%.

Base-case projections
Operating performances in the next 12-24 months will continue to remain satisfactory, supported by stable occupancy
and moderate rental reversion. The fund's good asset quality and limited market supply support its stable rental
income growth in the next two years. The company has managed to extend its weighted average lease maturity profile
to 2.9 years from 2.8 years. The diverse tenant profile supports the stability of future operating income.

Company Description
GHKLP is a private wholesale fund that invests primarily in logistics and warehouse properties as well as a few data
center properties in Hong Kong. It is open only to institutional investors. Goodman Group owns 20% of GHKLP.
GHKLP is incorporated in the Cayman Islands.
GHKLP is a leading provider of grade-A industrial space in Hong Kong with a portfolio of 12 stable assets and two
development sites in prime locations. The majority of its assets are located in the city's prime port zone and logistics
centers. As of March 31, 2019, GHKLP had a portfolio value of about HK$38.8 billion.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
We expect GHKLP to maintain a solid market position and good asset quality in Hong Kong's industrial property
sector. The fund also benefits from very low modern warehouse vacancy, limited new supplies, and stable demand.
These strengths are partially tempered by GHKLP's moderate scale, geographical and asset concentration, and shorter
lease profile relative to international peers.
In our view, GHKLP will be able to continue to generate stable and recurring cash flows over the next two years. We
believe the fund will maintain its good operational track record of achieving satisfactory occupancy rates and stable
rental yields of about 5% for the next 12-24 months. This is driven by GHKLP's strong market position in Hong Kong's
warehouse market, its high-quality assets, and prime warehouse location (e.g. close to key ports).
The project risk from the two new development projects are manageable, in our view. The company has secured
long-term leases for the Tsuen Wan West Building 1 on the back of growing demand for data centers in Hong Kong.
We expect low vacancy as there is limited supply for modern warehousing space. This is likely to temper the project
risk for Tuen Mun whilst it is being constructed. We believe GHKLP has demonstrated expertise and a track record of
building high-quality, modern logistic facilities.
Furthermore, we believe the completion of Tuen Mun and Tsuen Wan West Building 1 will further enhance GHKLP's
asset base and quality, as well as boost recurring cash flow. The fund plans to complete the construction of the above
projects in the next 2.5 to three years starting June 2019. We anticipate these new developments to generate a rental
yield of 5%-6% upon completion.
GHKLP faces asset and geographic concentration risk because it primarily focuses on logistics assets in Hong Kong.
However, we believe the fund's well-diversified tenant portfolio and increased exposure towards data centers allow
moderate resilience during an economic downturn, given its much longer lease terms. Its top 10 clients represent
about 42.2% of its total income, with no industry contributing more than 30% of the income.
GHKLP's weighted average lease expiry of about three years as of March 2019 exposes it to income volatility. In our
view, GHKLP's weighted average lease expiry is in line with the Asian market norm and the REITs we rate in
Singapore. However, it is shorter than that of other international peers.

HK$--Hong Kong dollar.

We consider AIMS APAC REIT (BBB-/Stable/--) as the closest peer for GHKLP. The peer has asset concentration in
Singapore, which is also an international logistics hub like Hong Kong. We also consider Hysan Development Co. Ltd.
(BBB+/Stable/--) as a peer because the company is a commercial REIT with exposure to retail and economic
developments in Hong Kong.
In our view, the industrial REIT market in Singapore is more fragmented and competitive than in Hong Kong. On the
other hand, Hong Kong's industrial supply is likely to remain tight, supporting GHKLP's market position.

Financial Risk: Intermediate
GHKLP is likely to operate with a tight financial headroom over the next two years. We expect GHKLP's
debt-to-EBITDA ratio to hover at 7.3x-7.5x and EBITDA interest coverage ratio to be 4.0x-4.5x over the next 12-24
months. Heightened leverage will be as a result of the development of the committed sites and performance fee to be
paid out in FY2021. The debt position has remain elevated since FY2019, mainly driven by investments in its two new
projects. Our forecast credit metrics takes into account the committed equity injection and dividend retention, and
assume no substantial acquisitions or other large development projects. As a result, GHKLP's stable recurring cash
flows and strong shareholder support (through equity injection and dividend retention) will somewhat keep leverage in
check. In our forecast, GHKLP's earnings will improve--underpinned by mild positive rental reversion due to limited
new supply in the modern warehouse market.
We expect the company's development capex to be close to HK$2.1 billion for Tuen Mun and HK$900.0 million for
Tsuen Wan West Building 1, spread over the next two to three years. This will be funded by a combination of new
equity (HK$2.7 billion) and dividend retention (HK$1.2 billion) from existing shareholders. An important factor
supporting its financial profile is its strong shareholders' support in providing equity financing for new projects. We
believe the company will initiate more new developments when there is a reasonable visibility on securing new tenants

and balance of debt and equity financing. In our view, this could temper potential development risk.
The economic nature of the fund's subordinated debt is equivalent to an equity investment, in our opinion. Specifically,
the subordinated debt is: (1) unsecured and subordinated to all existing and future third-party debt; (2) tied to ordinary
equity investments, and cannot be transferred or redeemed separately; and (3) carries no financial covenants. Any
nonpayment of interest by GHKLP would not constitute a default. We have therefore treated it as equity in our analysis
and ratio calculations up until fiscals 2018-2019. Subordinated debt will mature in September 2019 and we expect it to
convert to equity.

Liquidity: Strong
We assess GHKLP's liquidity to be strong. We expect the ratio of cash sources to cash uses to exceed 1.5x for the 12
months ending March 2020 based on the company's good cash flow generation, equity infusion, and undrawn bank
credit commitment. We also expect its sources to exceed uses even if its EBITDA declines 15% in fiscal 2020.
In our view, GHKLP can absorb low-probability, high-impact shocks because of its good recurring cash flows. The fund
has good banking relationships and a fair standing in the capital market.
We see low liquidity risk from investor redemption because GHKLP is a private fund and shareholders can only
redeem their investments at the fund's liquidity review date. The next date will be in 2020. The fund does not have
redemption facilities. It also has a good track record of investor support.

Covenant Analysis
GHKLP's banking facilities have leverage ratios and EBITDA interest coverage covenants. The subordinated debt is
not included in the covenant ratio calculations. We expect GHKLP to maintain a sufficient buffer to remain compliant
with its financial covenants.

Other Credit Considerations
GHKLP is positioned at the stronger end of its business and financial risk profiles, in our view. Its strong support from
a group of stable and long-term shareholders through controlled redemption requirement supports our view.
In comparison with Singapore REITs, GHKLP has a stronger market position, given that the Singapore market is more
fragmented and competitive than Hong Kong's. We therefore assign a positive score to GHKLP in our comparable
rating analysis, which leads to one notch of rating uplift over the anchor.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
As of March 31, 2019, GHKLP's adjusted debt structure consists of mostly unsecured debt with the only secured debt
from the Joint Venture Goodman Interlink facility. The weighted-average maturity of the total debt of GHKLP is over
four years.
GHKLP's percentage of secured debt (including debt at joint venture companies) is about 3% as of March 2019. This
does not exceed 35% of total undepreciated assets (or 40% of the fair market value of assets), as such its senior
unsecured debtholders are not disadvantaged compared with other debtholders.

Analytical conclusions
We do not view GHKLP's capital structure as having any material risks such as structure or contractual subordination.
The issue rating is therefore consistent with our 'BBB+' issuer credit rating.
