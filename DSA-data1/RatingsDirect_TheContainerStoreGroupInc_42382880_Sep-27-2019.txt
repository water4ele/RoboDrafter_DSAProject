Key Risks

Broad assortment of exclusive and unique organization
merchandise.

Small market share in the highly fragmented storage and organization product
and service segment.

Positive momentum in the Custom Closets portion of the
business continues to drive comparable sales growth.

Operating performance susceptible to economic and housing downturns due to
highly discretionary nature of products sold.
Leonard Green & Partners' significant ownership of more than 50% of the
common stock increases the risk of a future leveraging event, in our view.

We expect sales growth from positive comparable sales and modest unit additions will alleviate expected margin
pressures. We project The Container Store Group (TCS) will report modest sales growth of 2% to 3% for the fiscal year
ending March 2020. Sales are better as a result of positive momentum from the Custom Closets portion of the
business, which in fiscal 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 contributed meaningfully to overall comparable sales
growth, providing an overall lift of 300 and 500 basis points (bps) respectively. We believe this growth will somewhat
offset margin pressures from increased marketing, unfavorable mix shifts, labor, and direct material costs at Elfa we
anticipate for the remainder of the year.

The company has taken strategic action to combat Chinese tariffs, but further tariffs are a risk.The Container Store's
Chinese imports make up roughly 36% of merchandise as of March 30, 2019. The company affirmed its fiscal 2019
guidance including the impacts of tariffs increasing to 25%. However, there remains a risk that tariffs will be expanded,
which could negatively affect operating performance to the extent the company cannot absorb the impact or is
required to increase pricing to preserve margins.
Credit metrics are improving but we remain cautious on the sustainability of the company's performance. For the fiscal
year ended March 30, 2019, The Container Store's S&P Global Ratings' adjusted leverage was 3.8x, a meaningful
decline from 4.6x the year prior. However, we remain cautious on the company's ability to sustain positive
performance momentum, particularly if the economy slows or enters a recession. In particular, we highlight that
Custom Closets represent roughly half of the company's sales, with price points ranging from around $1,000 to
$10,000. We view purchases of Custom Closets merchandise as very discretionary given the high average ticket, and
thus view The Container Store as more exposed to possible negative impacts from consumer spending declines
relative to other retailers.

Controlling ownership by a financial sponsor increases the risk of a leveraging event.Leonard Green & Partners'
continues to hold significant ownership of more than 50%, which weighs on our view of the company's financial risk
profile given the potential to exercise significant influence over financial policies. We believe the likelihood of debt
financed shareholder returns or other aggressive actions remains elevated through the next 12 months.

Outlook: Stable

S&P Global Ratings' stable outlook on The Container Store Group Inc. reflects our expectation for continued
modest operating performance improvement with generally stable revenue and adjusted EBITDA margins. This
occurs as the company benefits from maintaining pricing (because of its niche industry position) and continued
focus on cost controls.

Upside scenario
We would consider an upgrade if we believe operating performance improvements are sustainable even in a
pressured macroeconomic environment, leading to adjusted leverage maintained below 4x. This scenario could
occur if same-store sales increase at a mid-single-digit rate and adjusted EBITDA margins expand by more than
200 bps from current levels. In addition, we would need to believe the risk of a releveraging event is low, which
would likely require the private equity sponsor to reduce its ownership stake below 40%.

Downside scenario
We could lower the ratings if we expect total adjusted debt to EBITDA to increase to above 5.5x. This could occur
if operating performance and profitability decreased meaningfully due to increased competition from traditional
and online competitors, and reduced consumer spending.

Base-Case Projections
We believe TCS will generate positive free cash flow of about $20 million for 2019. We also expect higher capital
spending, which includes increased spending related to the completion of its second distribution center. However, our
forecast for slightly higher operating cash flows leads to free operating cash flow that is roughly flat with fiscal 2018.

Company Description
TCS is a specialty retailer of storage and organization products operating through 92 retail stores across 33 U.S. states
and wholly-owned Swedish subsidiary Elfa International that designs and manufactures component-based shelving and
drawer systems. Financial sponsor Leonard Green & Partners maintains substantial 55% ownership (as of July 5, 2019)
in the company.

Business Risk: Weak
TCS has small market share (with about 92 stores) in the fragmented storage and organization segment of the retail
industry. The company sells highly discretionary products in our view (particularly the custom closets portion of the
business that represents half of revenue) and faces intense competitive pressures from mass-merchant and online
retailers in the remaining storage and organization part of business.
We expect TCS will be able to achieve generally stable operating performance driven by its continued focus on
growing private-label custom closets while managing expenses. However, our expectations for increased costs lead to
roughly flat EBITDA over the next 12 months. Gross margin declines at Elfa have historically weighed on overall
margins, largely due to increases in material costs, which we expect to continue.

TCS' key initiative is to maintain current positive momentum in the Custom Closets portion of the business by adding
a new product line (Avera), rebranding stores, and focus on increasing omnichannel sales. The company has a loyalty
program (POP!), with roughly 7.7 million members as of the end of the first quarter of 2019, and continues to focus on
digital spending in line with competitors.
For fiscal 2019 (year ending March 2020), we project comparable-store sales growth in the low-single digits and a lowto mid-single-digit increase in total sales. This is largely the result of two additional stores opening and a same-store
sales lift from Custom Closets. Company initiatives, including the expansion of private-label offerings, the
well-maintained store base, and disciplined pricing strategy will also help maintain modest same-store sales growth
longer term.
We assess the comparable rating analysis, which is a holistic view of the stand-alone credit profile, as negative given
its relatively smaller scale compared with rated peers, highly discretionary merchandise offering that could lead to
meaningful sales pressure in an unfavorable macroeconomic environment, and weaker operating performance
compared with industry peers over the past several years.

Peer comparison
Floor & Decor Holdings Inc. and At Home Group Inc. are higher-rated peers that operate in the hard surface flooring
and home decor retail segments. Both have historically had greater comparable sales growth, benefitting from their
position as low cost leaders in their retail segments due to favorable consumer demand and focus on value-priced
merchandise across all retail categories.

Financial Risk: Aggressive
Our assessment reflects the company's controlling ownership (about 55% of equity) by Leonard Green. While debt
leverage was down to 3.8x as of fiscal 2018 from 4.6x the previous year, the controlling ownership by a financial
sponsor ownership continues to weigh on our view of financial risk given the potential to exercise significant influence
over financial policies.
We forecast TCS' funds from operations (FFO) to total debt to be stable in the 16% to 18% range in 2019 and 2020 as
incremental lease obligations related to new store openings offset modest EBITDA growth. We expect leverage to
improve only moderately through both earnings growth and debt reduction through required amortization payments.

Liquidity: Adequate
We forecast the company will have adequate liquidity for operating needs over the next 12 months, with liquidity
sources exceeding uses. We believe TCS has sound relationships with its banks, generally satisfactory standing in the
credit markets, and faces no near-term maturity risks.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Balance sheet cash of $11.4 million as of June 29,
2019;

• Capital spending of roughly $40 million by
fiscal-year-end March 2020;

• About $57 million of availability under the $100
million asset-based loan (ABL) facility; and

• $25 million of estimated seasonal working capital
outflows; and

• Cash FFO of more than $60 million in the next 12
months.

• Required debt amortization of about $7 million per
year.

Debt maturities
As of fiscal-year-end 2018, the company's debt maturities were as follows. There are no near-term refinancing needs,
with most debt maturing in 2023.
• Fiscal 2019: $7 million

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 4, 2019 9

The Container Store Group Inc.

• Fiscal 2020: $7 million
• Fiscal 2021: $7 million
• Fiscal 2022: $7 million
• Fiscal 2023: $242 million

Covenant Analysis
The credit agreement includes a maximum leverage covenant of 5x. In addition, the $100 million ABL revolving credit
facility is subject to a springing fixed-charge coverage covenant of 1x if the company fails to maintain availability of at
least $10 million, which we do not expect to be triggered over the next 12 months. We forecast adequate headroom
under the maximum leverage covenant over the next 12 months.

Issue Ratings--Recovery Analysis
Key Analytical Factors
• Our 'B' issue-level rating on the amended $257.4 million senior secured term loan that matures in September 2023 is
'B'. The recovery rating remains '3', reflecting our expectation for meaningful (50% to 70%; rounded estimate: 65%)
recovery in the event of default.
• Our simulated default scenario contemplates a default in 2022, resulting from declines in revenue and EBITDA
because of increased competition from home furnishing retailers and other discounters, weakness in the housing
market, a slowdown in the economy that leads to lower consumer discretionary income, and management's
difficulty executing its growth strategies. These factors all lead to declining demand for storage and custom storage
products and a loss of market share and require aggressive promotions and discounting to move inventory.
• Our recovery analysis assumes that, in a hypothetical bankruptcy scenario, the senior secured term loan holders
would benefit from a first-priority lien on the personal property of the company and subsidiary guarantors that is not
otherwise pledged as collateral for ABL facility, where the term loan facility has a second-priority lien. We think the
first-lien term loan lenders would benefit from the first-lien security pledge that includes capital stock of the
borrower and subsidiary guarantors and 65% of the capital stock of foreign subsidiaries.
• In addition, we assume the company's Elfa division would not be a party to any bankruptcy proceedings and that
the associated Elfa debt would be satisfied by the overseas operations.
• We assume the company emerges from a bankruptcy event and value the company on a going-concern basis using
a 5x multiple applied to our projected emergence-level EBITDA, in line with other comparable peers in the home
décor and furniture industry. We estimate a gross emergence value of $233 million.
• We believe a 47% EBITDA decline (from 2018 levels) or $46.5 million emergence EBITDA level is a prudent
rebound from a default scenario. This is assuming that if 20% of company's stores close and it is subject to inventory
clearance at discounted rates with cost cutting, the company could return to the mid-7% EBITDA margin level.
• After adjusting for the value we attribute to estimated administrative expenses and priority claims (ABL facility), we
forecast about $164 million in collateral value available to satisfy first-lien term loan claims.
