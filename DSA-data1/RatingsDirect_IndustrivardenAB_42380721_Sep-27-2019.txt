Overview
Key Strengths

Key Risks

Excellent portfolio liquidity; all investments are minority stakes in blue-chip
companies that are heavily traded on the Stockholm Stock Exchange.

Moderately concentrated investments with the three largest
assets--Sandvik, AB Volvo, and Essity--representing about 63%
of the portfolio.

High asset quality, with average portfolio credit quality comfortably in the low
'A' rating category.

Investments are largely Sweden-based, reducing geographic
diversity.

Track record of pursuing conservative investment strategies, with management
focused on keeping a strong balance sheet with limited debt (Swedish krona
[SEK]2.7 net debt as of June 30, 2019).

Exposure to equity market valuations and volatility could
occasionally lead to higher LTV ratios.

S&P Global Ratings' expectations of continued conservative financial policies
with a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio below 10% (2.5% at June 30, 2019).
Very robust cash flow adequacy ratio. Following low interest costs, and our
expectations of about SEK 4 billion-SEK4.2 billion in dividend income, we
forecast very high cash flow adequacy at around 30x.

Industrivärden holds a lucrative investment portfolio and has significant financial flexibility. Industrivärden invests
only in listed assets, holding minority stakes typically less than 20% of the capital in blue-chip companies that are
heavily traded on the Stockholm Stock Exchange, resulting in high portfolio liquidity in our view. The underlying credit
quality of the investment portfolio is high, at 'A-', meaning that we expect investees to generate stable earnings and
recurring cash flows over the cycle, and envisage significant protection against total losses. In our view, these
investment strategies underpin Industrivärden's financial flexibility.

Recent disposals has created ample headroom under the financial commitment to maintain an LTV ratio of 0%-10%.
The current financial policy was introduced in February 2016 when Mr. Fredrik Lundberg took over as chairman of the
board. Since then, Industrivärden has lowered its LTV ratio to about 2.5 at the end of the second quarter of 2019 from
about 12% as of year-end 2015. The largest improvement has been achieved thanks the sell-down of its stake in ICA
during 2019 and SSAB during 2018, which allowed management to reduce net debt substantially. At the end of the
second quarter of 2019, net debt totaled about SEK2.7 billion compared with about SEK11 billion at year-end 2017.
We view this as a strong indication that the company's risk tolerance has decreased and we perceive management as
very committed to keeping the LTV ratio within 0%-10%. We therefore don't foresee any near term acquisitions or
additions to the investment portfolio.
Very strong cash flow adequacy ratio, but this is unlikely to lead to lower adjusted debt. In our base case, we assume
robust cash flow ratios of about 30x and total dividend and interest income of about SEK4 billion-SEK5 billion in 2019.
We expect Industrivärden to use what is left after the shareholder distribution of SEK 2.5 billion that was paid in the
second quarter of 2019 to be invested in some or several of its existing portfolio companies. Given the already very
low debt level (SEK2.6 billion), we view this as a very prudent strategy, as over time it will meaningfully expand the
portfolio and reinforce headroom under the LTV ratio.

Outlook

The stable outlook reflects our expectation that Industrivärden's LTV ratio will remain below 10%. We assume the
company will maintain high financial flexibility by focusing on minority-owned listed investments, relatively low
ownership of assets in the portfolio, and investees with high underlying credit quality.

Downside scenario
We could lower the ratings if Industrivärden's leverage increased materially from current levels, with the LTV ratio
staying above 10% for a prolonged period. This could, for example, result from a steep decline in equity markets if
the company did not take measures to counterbalance the increase in the LTV ratio. It could also stem from
increasing debt to fund shareholder-friendly measures, although we think such a scenario is highly unlikely in the
near term.

Upside scenario
We are unlikely to take a positive rating action since this would require Industrivärden to hold a materially larger
and more diversified portfolio while keeping the LTV ratio below 10%.

Base-Case Projections
The LTV ratio is expected to remain within its leverage policy of 0%-10%. We believe that any deviation over the next
two years to be unlikely. With the current very low debt level, asset prices needs to shrink materially before the policy
is breached. Even if the portfolio, for whatever reason, were to drop 50%, Industrivärden would be well in line with its
LTV policy, thanks to the very low debt level. As management over the last two years been very active in reducing
debt, we perceive its intention is to continue operating with a significantly lower debt level than in the past.
Thanks to this, we also believe that Industrivärden should be able to withstand higher volatility in the equity market.
This is important, as after a relatively long period of price increases, Industrivärden's share price has increased by 47%
over the past five years (see chart 2), compared with OMX Stockholm (+32%). We now expect the global economy to

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 4, 2019 4

Industrivarden AB

enter a period of less supportive macroeconomic conditions and greater instability that is likely to lead to more
volatility in asset prices. Uncertainty from Brexit, the China/U.S. trade war, and geopolitical tensions could all lead to
increased volatility and lower share prices amid tightening credit conditions. We believe, however, that Industrivärden
is well prepared and should be able to keep its LTV within the group's target range, even if share prices decline in the
coming years. This is further underpinned by Industrivärden's strategy to continue gradually investing in the existing
portfolio, and finance acquisition predominantly by dividend income. We expect that this strategy over time will
continue to build further headroom in the rating.

Company Description
Industrivarden is a publicly owned investment holding company founded in 1944 that primarily invests in a
concentrated selection of listed Nordic companies. Its largest individual shareholder is L E Lundbergforetagen AB
(Lundbergs; A+/Stable/A-1), with 23.7% of the votes and 16.5% of the capital. We view Lundbergs as a conservative
and long-term holding, which supports the rating on Industrivärden.

Business Risk
Portfolio supported by superior liquidity and strong asset quality. Industrivärden's business risk profile is bolstered by
its focus on listed minority stakes in entities that have strong credit quality and shares that are heavily traded on the
Stockholm Stock Exchange. Despite a stated long-term investment horizon, we believe the company could completely
or partly liquidate an investment in a short period of time, if necessary. We think that the portfolio will continue to
benefit from excellent asset liquidity and to compare favorably with that of most peers, since Industrivärden is an

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 4, 2019 5

Industrivarden AB

investment holding company with only listed assets, and also low ownership interest, typically below 20%.
Further supporting the ratings are both the portfolio companies' diversified industrial footprints and substantial
international operations, which offset Industrivärden's domestic exposure and overreliance on one or two sectors.
Moderately concentrated portfolio. Industrivärden's investment portfolio comprise eight core holdings (after the
disposal of ICA earlier in 2019), spread over sectors such as banking, heavy trucks, construction, forest products, and
capital goods. Nevertheless, its portfolio exhibits only modest asset diversification as the three largest assets constitute
about 60% of the portfolio (see chart 3). On June 30, 2019, its portfolio was worth about SEK106.8 billion (US$11.1
billion, up from SEK92 billion at year-end 2018 (US$10.5 billion). The largest asset is Sandvik AB (A-/Stable/A-2),
comprising about 24.6% of the portfolio; followed by AB Volvo (A-/Stable/A-2), representing 21%; and Essity AB
(BBB+/Stable/A-2) at 18%.

Compared with its peers, Industrivärden has the highest proportion of listed assets in its portfolio and relatively low
ownership interest, typically below 20%. Nevertheless, our view of Industrivärden's portfolio risk is constrained by its
top three assets making up 63% of its portfolio. Our ratings on Industrivärden are at the same level as those on
Lundbergs (A+/Stable/A-1), but due to the size of Industrivärden's portfolio, below those on Investor AB
(AA-/Stable/A-1+), and Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited (AAA/Stable/A-1+). Those tend to be more diversified
than Industrivärden.

Financial Risk
We expect Industrivärden's LTV ratio to remain below 10% over the coming two years. Management published a new
debt policy in 2016 and has since firmly executed on the strategy, which has resulted in very low debt. We therefore
deem the company's policy limiting the LTV ratio to within 0%-10% as very prudent, and we perceive management as
committed to its financial policy. Both in 2018 and 2019, the company has used proceeds from asset sales to lower net
debt, thereby reducing the LTV ratio to 2.5% at the end of June 2019 from 10% in 2017. The financial risk policy also
implies lower dividend payouts, allowing for positive cash flow before changes in the asset portfolio. In our view, these
factors have strengthened Industrivärden's financial risk since 2016.
We assess the company's management and governance as strong, reflecting its consistent strategy and stringent
financial policy.

Liquidity
We assess Industrivärden's liquidity as strong since we forecast a ratio of cash sources to cash needs at around 1.7x
over the next 12 months. Our view of liquidity is further supported by relatively low total debt. We also acknowledge
that all investment companies have declared their dividends for 2019, and expect that has been paid out already during
April 2019. Furthermore, we consider that Industrivärden's strong ties with Handelsbanken support its ability to
quickly obtain bank financing if needed. We also expect Industrivärden would be able to absorb a high-impact event
with limited need for refinancing, given its low leverage. Such a scenario would likely be a severe correction of market
values for Industrivärden's listed shares, which we consider manageable in view of its low LTV ratio.

Issue Ratings--Subordination Risk Analysis
We rate Industrivärden's debt 'A+', the same as the issuer credit rating, since no significant elements of subordination
risk are present in the capital structure in our view. This is further supported by the company's low leverage and ability
to liquidate assets to redeem debt. In our analysis of investment holding companies, we focus on the parent company
and related financing vehicles' debt instruments, but don't take into account debt at investee companies.
