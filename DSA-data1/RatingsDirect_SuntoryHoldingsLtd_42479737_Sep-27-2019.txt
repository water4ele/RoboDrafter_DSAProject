Overview
Key strengths

Key risks

Strong brand recognition as a major general beverage manufacturer in
Japan and overseas with competitive product lines for alcoholic and
nonalcoholic drinks

A likelihood of profitability remaining weaker than that of its global
competitors over the next few years, due in part to rising supply
chain costs in the soft drink market

Balanced and diversified revenue sources, including in key market Japan,
North America, Europe, and elsewhere in Asia, with a solid business base in
the spirits segment in the U.S.

Low profitability in the beer business amid a challenging operating
environment

The second-largest and a steadily increasing share of the Japanese soft
drink market, backed by successful merchandising and product
development strategies

High reliance on debt financing, with its debt ratios remaining high
compared with its peers

Prospects of continued improvement in key financial ratios, underpinned by
stable cash flow generation under conservative financial management, after
the acquisition of U.S.-based Beam

Suntory has established a strong brand portfolio through its agile development capabilities that tailor products to
consumer needs and preferences. S&P Global Ratings believes the Japan-based major general beverage manufacturer
Suntory Holdings Ltd. can maintain strong brand recognition in Japan and elsewhere. It offers a wide variety of
competitive product lines for both alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks. Multiple product categories contribute to overall
profit, backed by successful merchandising and product development strategies. Its product portfolio is also
geographically diversified. The company's efforts to develop products that reflect the needs of each consumption
market have been successful. In addition to key market Japan, the company has solid brand portfolios in North
America, Europe, and elsewhere in Asia, gained through acquisitions and the establishment of joint ventures. Given
this, we expect Suntory to steadily generate cash flow in the coming years.
We expect Suntory's key financial ratios to continue to improve, backed by stable generation of cash flow and
conservative financial management. The company's ratio of debt to EBITDA, a key cash flow metric, is likely to
steadily improve to about 3.3x in fiscal 2019, ending Dec. 31, 2019. We then expect it to decrease to about 3.0x the
following fiscal year. We base this on our view that the company is likely to record solid earnings growth. Support will
also come from hybrid capital, such as subordinated loans and debt (about ¥130 billion), that the company issued in
August 2019. The ratio substantially deteriorated as a result of the acquisition of U.S.-based Beam Inc. (Beam Suntory)
in 2014. However, the ratio had recovered to 3.8x by fiscal 2018. This figure is commensurate with our significant

assessment of the company's financial risk profile. The improvement was driven by solid business performances and
prudent financial management that prioritized improvement of the weakened finances. We expect Suntory's financial
standing to continue improving despite the challenging competitive environment, in light of its stable cash flow
generation and financial discipline.
Chart 1

Suntory's profitability is likely to remain weak compared to global peers.We think the company's profitability will
remain lower than that of major global beverage companies, even when considering differences in scale, operational
geography, product line, and business field. In the Japanese soft drink business, which accounts for about 30% of total
sales, competition remains fierce: The market has matured. Supply chain costs, such as those for raw materials
procurement and logistics, have also risen. These factors are likely to limit any improvement in the company's
profitability over the next two to three years, in our view. Going forward, profitability is likely to continue to be
subdued in its beer business, which mainly focuses on the domestic market and generates about 20% of the company's
total revenue. Suntory's share in its home market is gradually expanding, but the company remains in No. 3 position,
lagging far behind the top two beer producers. The heavy burdens of product development costs and sales promotion
expenses amid the fierce competition for share will continue to weigh on Suntory's profitability, in our view.

Suntory Holdings Ltd.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our view that Suntory's debt to EBITDA will improve to 3.0x-3.5x in a year or two. We
base this view that Suntory's solid performance will continue to be supported by the company's strong brand
recognition and product development capabilities in the global alcoholic beverage and soft drinks markets. The
outlook also reflects our view that the company will not make sizable debt-financed acquisitions in the next two
years or so.

Upside scenario
We may consider an upgrade if debt to EBITDA is more likely to improve to below 3x on a sustainable basis. This
could occur if the company steadily strengthens its business base while successfully reducing its reliance on debt
through prudent financial management.

Downside scenario
We could downgrade Suntory if its debt to EBITDA were to worsen to below 4x with little prospect of a quick
recovery. This could occur if its financial standing deteriorated, potentially due to aggressive business acquisitions
or capital expenditures or a downturn in earnings.

• Steady expansion of Suntory's shares in the
maturing Japanese soft drinks and alcoholic
beverages markets through strengthened core
brands
• Moderate growth in Suntory's sales volume of
alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages in North
America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific
• Moderately high levels of annual capital
expenditures at ¥120 billion-¥130 billion in the next
two to three years, driven by a series of supply chain
initiatives such as increasing the ratio of in-house
manufacturing
• Maintenance of current shareholder returns with
free cash flow after dividends of about ¥130
billion-¥150 billion annually
• No sizable debt-financed acquisitions in the next two
years or so

Base-case projections
Suntory's EBITDA margin will remain stable at around 16%.Supply chain costs, including raw material procurement
and logistic costs, will increase. However, its EBITDA margin will be stable at about 16% in the next couple of years.
This is because the company's efforts to pass on expenses to customers through price hikes, add value to products,
and cut costs.
The company's debt to EBITDA will steadily improve. Suntory's ratio of debt to EBITDA will improve to about 3x in
the next year or two. Stable free cash flow generation and prudent financial management, including the utilization of
hybrid capital, will help facilitate this improvement.

Company Description
Suntory is Japan's largest general beverage manufacturer in terms of revenue. Among its main brands are Yamazaki,

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 16, 2019 6

Suntory Holdings Ltd.

Kakubin, Jim Beam, Maker's Mark, The Premium Malt's, Suntory Tennensui, Boss, and Iyemon. By segment, soft
drinks and foods account for 46% of operating profit, followed by alcoholic beverages (45%), and others (9%) in fiscal
2018 (ended Dec. 31, 2018). By region for the same period, Japan accounts for 58% of sales, followed by Americas
(13%), Europe (14%), and Asia and Oceania (15%).

Business Risk: Strong
We believe Suntory is likely to maintain its strong competitiveness in Japan's soft drink market, backed by successful
merchandising and product development strategies that address, for example, the needs of health-conscious
consumers. The company has steadily increased its market share by strengthening its core brands and launching
high-value-added products, narrowing the gap with the top player, Coca-Cola (Japan) Co. Ltd., in our view. The
company has also established a fair presence in overseas soft drink markets thanks to the growth of multiple beverage
brands it has acquired in Europe, Asia, and Oceania. In addition, it has successfully nurtured, expanded, and improved
its own brands as well as introduced new ones.
In its alcoholic beverage operations, we expect Suntory to continue to strengthen its competitiveness and revenue
base in overseas markets. In the spirits segment, the company has a solid business base in the U.S. We think it has also
strengthened its positions in the spirits markets outside the U.S. through sales of Beam brand drinks in Japan and
Suntory brand products overseas. It has also promoted its premium products.
In our view, Suntory has steadily gained additional benefits out of the acquisition of U.S.-based Beam Inc. (Beam
Suntory) in 2014. The companies procure raw materials and develop products together.

Peer comparison
We consider Diageo PLC of the U.K., Pernod Ricard S.A. of France, Heineken N.V. of Netherlands, and PepsiCo Inc. of
the U.S.--a major nonalcoholic beverage company--to be peers of Suntory. Suntory offers nonalcoholic beverages such
as mineral water, coffee, and tea, and other drinks in a variety of categories, including beers and spirits. The company
has a broader business scope than Diageo, Pernod Ricard, and Heineken, which rely on specific alcoholic beverage
categories such as spirits and beers for their earnings. Suntory also has revenue sources in the less discretionary
segments such as mineral water and tea. These factors support the company's credit quality, in our view.
Meanwhile, we regard a still lower proportion of its sales from overseas operations (about 40%) compared with the
four peers as a weakness in our analysis. This is despite the company's efforts to steadily diversify its geographic
footprint. In addition, its EBITDA margin remains at about 16%, far below the 20%-40% level of the four beverage
companies. This indicates that Suntory's profitability is lower than that of major global beverage companies, even
when considering differences in scale, operational geography, and business fields. We view this as another weakness in
our analysis.

Financial Risk: Significant
Suntory's debt to EBITDA is likely to stay on a moderate improvement path, in our view. We expect the company to
generate stable free cash flow, thanks to solid business performance, allowing it to reduce debt steadily. As a result, the
ratio is likely to improve to 3.0x-3.5x in fiscal 2019, and to about 3x in fiscal 2020, respectively, from above 6x after the
acquisition of Beam.
We think Suntory has many challenges in its existing businesses. These include:
• Developing an efficient logistics network;
• Ensuring mark-up initiatives are in place in its soft drink business; and
• Further strengthening its brands in the alcoholic beverage business.
Given the necessity of addressing these issues and the prospect of the company maintaining prudent financial
management, we think Suntory will likely prioritize strengthening its current business base. It will do so by utilizing the
benefits of past acquisitions without making sizable acquisitions in the next two to three years.
Based on our hybrid capital criteria, we classify the hybrid capital Suntory has issued thus far (about ¥400 billion
outstanding as of September 2019, including both subordinated debt and loans) as having intermediate equity content.
We attribute this to the issuer's option to defer interest and dividend payments, the instruments' sufficient permanence,
and their subordination to other debt in liquidation or bankruptcy. In calculating financial measurements for Suntory,
based on our assessment, we subtract 50% of the above hybrid capital amount from its reported debt outstanding,
inclusive of hybrids, for the company's adjusted debt.
We expect Suntory's hybrid capital to continue to account for a relatively large share of total capital. We do not
assume the issuance amount of hybrid loans or debt will increase further. However, if the company became
excessively dependent on hybrid capital, leading to a deterioration of its quality, we could view it as a negative factor
in our assessment of its financial risk profile.

Liquidity: Strong
We assess Suntory's liquidity as strong. We expect the company's liquidity sources to exceed 1.5x its uses for the next
24 months and to continue to exceed its uses even if EBITDA declines 30%.
Refinancing risk is low given the company's close relationships with its main creditor banks, unused committed
facilities, and debt maturities spread over time.
The following liquidity sources and uses include our estimates for the year from June 30, 2019.

Covenant Analysis
No negative covenants on Suntory's debt materially affect its financial activities.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

ESG risks are currently not major rating drivers for Suntory. Regarding social risks, Suntory's operations are
somewhat susceptible to rapidly changing consumer tastes. Some are arising from demographic changes; for
example, Japan's beer market by volume has shrank 14 years in a row due to changing consumer preference and
rising health awareness amid an aging population. Despite these challenges, Suntory has demonstrated steady
earnings over time by expanding its market shares in both domestic soft and alcohol drinks markets. We believe
management has mitigated these risk factors with appropriate product development and marketing initiatives.
Demand for sweetened beverages, such as carbonated soft drinks has continued to decline, mainly in developed
markets, due to growing concerns over their impact on health. However, we expect a limited impact on Suntory's
overall business because its sweetened beverages account for a smaller share of overall total beverage sales than
they do at major global peers.
Environmental risks are less relevant, in our view. There are direct and indirect long-term risks such as water
availability, agricultural production, and the global anti-plastic movement. The group has increased its usage of
recycled PET bottles and preservation of forests, with more than 20 natural water sanctuaries, creating a
sustainable supply of its beverage products such as mineral water.

Group Influence
We base the 'BBB' long-term issuer credit rating on Beam Suntory on its status as a core subsidiary of the group as
well as the 'bbb' group credit profile for Suntory. Our assessment of Beam Suntory as a core subsidiary mainly reflects
our view that:

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 16, 2019 11

Suntory Holdings Ltd.

• It is an essential business for the group strategy;
• Suntory's management team has a strong commitment to support the subsidiary; and
• Suntory considers it closely linked to its reputation, brands, and risk management.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
The consolidated debt of Suntory, a nonoperating holding company, consists of, among others, loans, bonds,
subordinated loans, and subordinated bonds as well as loans and bonds of its subsidiaries, including Suntory Beverage
& Food Ltd. and Beam Suntory. Some of these debts are secured.

Analytical conclusions
The priority debt ratio (the sum of an issuer's total secured debt and its operating subsidiaries' debt divided by the
issuer's total debt) for Suntory is just less than 30%. This is below the 50% threshold for us to consider notching down
the issue rating to reflect risk of structural subordination. We equalize the long-term issue rating on Suntory's senior
unsecured debt with the long-term issuer credit rating on the company. This is because we see a limited likelihood of
more senior debt significantly disadvantaging this unsecured debt.
