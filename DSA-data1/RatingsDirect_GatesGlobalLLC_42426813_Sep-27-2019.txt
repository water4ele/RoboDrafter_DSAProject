High leverage despite debt reduction post IPO

EBITDA margins will remain under pressure amid low industry volumes.Gates recently cut its 2019 organic growth
target (now expects a decline of 5%-7%) because of slowing demand in industrial end markets (58% of 2018 revenue).
This decline in organic sales will be the worst decline since 2009 (when the company's organic sales declined nearly
15%). This coincides with increased odds of a recession in North America, soft conditions in the automotive original
equipment (OE) demand (especially in China and Europe), as well as destocking pressures in the relatively resilient
auto replacement market. We expect the largest downside risks to persist in its industrial end-markets, including the
agriculture end market where many of its replacement channel partners, particularly in North America, are likely to
curb order activity after de-stocking inventory in the last quarter. We also expect some pressure to build from a weak
construction end market in China. This will exacerbate the company's historical suboptimal capacity utilization. Hence,
we incorporate weaker margins over the next 12 months and any improvement beyond 2020 is highly contingent on
more favorable market conditions and smooth execution of management's cost reduction efforts.
Aggressive financial policies by the company's sponsor remains a key risk. Post the IPO in 2018, Blackstone still owns
about 85% of the company. As a result, the company remains exposed to debt-funded dividends or share repurchases
tied to Blackstone and hence we do not assume any significant deleveraging will occur over the next 12 months. We
expect Gates to maintain debt to EBITDA (including our adjustments for unfunded pension and other postretirement
employee benefits liabilities and operating leases) around 4.5x-5.0x over the next two years.
Management appears committed to debt reduction and expects to reduce working capital levels as well as capital
expenditures (capex) in the second half of this year, but will not achieve its stated goal of bringing net leverage below
3x in 2019. This compares to 3.7x (per management calculations) for the 12 months ended June 30, 2019. While the
IPO transaction in early 2018 reduced the company's leverage, debt to EBITDA (based on our adjustments, which do

SEPTEMBER 9, 2019 3

Gates Global LLC

not net cash against debt) is likely to rise above 5.0x in 2019 (well above the 2018 level of 4.3x).
Gates end-market diversity remains a positive credit factor. Gates remains moderately exposed to the cyclical and
highly fragmented OE (first fit) end markets but the majority of sales (about 62% of sales in 2018) come from the less
cyclical automotive and industrial aftermarkets. During the past few recessions, the replacement businesses
decelerated early but also led the recovery sooner than its first-fit segments.
Because company's products perform critical functions in systems where the cost of failure is exceptionally high
relative to the cost of belts and hoses, its customers need to follow replacement cycles, which should lead to a
recovery.

Gates Global LLC

Outlook: Stable

S&P Global Ratings' stable outlook on Gates Global LLC reflects our view that despite softness in its end-markets,
the company should be able to generate a free operating cash flow (FOCF)-to-debt ratio of more than 5%, and
maintain debt to EBITDA in the around 5.0x over the next 12 months. These metrics are consistent with our
expectations for the current rating.

Downside scenario
We could lower our ratings on Gates Global over the next 12 months if prolonged softness in the company's
industrial end markets increases the likelihood that its FOCF-to-debt ratio will fall to less than 5% on a sustained
basis. Alternately, we could also lower our ratings on Gates if it pursues debt-financed acquisitions, shareholder
distributions, or any other activity that would increase its leverage above our expectations for the rating. Gates'
growth strategy focuses on emerging-market growth. Investments abroad entail risk and could stifle Gates' growth
if there are any missteps along the way.
We could lower the ratings within the next 12 months if cost-reduction efforts and working-capital reduction does
not lead to FOCF above 5% on a sustained basis.

Upside scenario
Though improbable over the next 12 months, we could raise our ratings on Gates Global if its leverage approaches
4.0x and its FOCF to debt would be at least 10% on sustained basis. We would also have to see significantly
improved operating performance, which could result from cost reductions. This scenario would also assume the
company does not undertake any major debt-funded acquisitions or shareholder distributions leading up to the
ultimate exit of financial sponsor Blackstone Group L.P.(which would cause us to reassess the company's financial
policy).

Assumptions

• U.S. GDP growth is poised to slow down this year to
2.2% from 2.9% in 2018, and further weakening to
1.7% in 2020. We estimate a 30%-35% risk of
recession within the next 12 months. European GDP
growth of 1.3% in 2019, 1.9% in 2020, and 1.8% in
2021; and Asia-Pacific GDP growth of 5.2% in 2019,

• Global light vehicle volume growth to be down in
2019, primarily due to weaker sales in the U.S. and
China. We expect stabilization in 2020, with only
modest growth in China and flat sales in Europe,
offsetting still-declining volumes in the U.S.
• U.S. industrial equipment investment growth in the
2.0%-3.0% range. Global miles driven, which is a key
factor in the vehicle-repair industry, increases in line
with global GDP growth.
• Revenues expected to be down high-single digits in
2019 with low-single-digit percent organic sales
growth in 2020 and 2021 based on the company's
exposure to the automotive end markets and its
industrial end markets.
• EBITDA margins down nearly 300 basis points (bps)
year over year in 2019 after incorporating the
impact of lower volumes on fixed overheads and
ongoing restructuring-related expenses. Modest
recovery in 2020 and 2021.
• No material acquisitions or divestitures over the
next two years.

Base-case projections
We expect Gates Global's FOCF to debt to remain relatively flat from 2018 levels mainly due to reduced capex despite
lower EBITDA margins.

Company Description
Gates Global LLC is a leading global manufacturer of power transmission belts and fluid power products that are
highly engineered and critical components used in diverse industrial and automotive applications, with aftermarket
revenue representing around 62% of sales of approximately $3.3 billion revenues for 2018. Gates became a portfolio
company of The Blackstone Group in 2014. Post-IPO in early 2018, Blackstone remains the controlling shareholder,

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 9, 2019 6

Gates Global LLC

with approximately 85% of the common shares of Gates Industrial Corporation plc, a newly formed parent holding
company for Gates Global LLC.

Business Risk: Fair
We expect Gates to maintain resilient business prospects (relative to most 'B+' issuers) given its relatively large scale
and strong competitive position as a premium product provider. This should help Gates sustain the market position of
its core products (Gates-branded belts, hoses, pulleys, and related products) in the automotive and industrial markets.
We continue to believe Gates will maintain its good geographic diversity. Nearly half of the revenue from the Gates
brand is tied to North America and over 22% from the Asia-Pacific region. These are markets where economic
conditions are currently more favorable than in Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa.
We expect the company to maintain and improve its competitive advantage from end users switching from chains to
belts for their industrial applications. Gates products can be retrofit onto existing applications where chains are used,
both supporting Gates' aftermarket business and providing the end-user enhancements over traditional chains.
In the fluid power segment (35% of sales)--recent capex investments should help position Gates well for growth,
particularly at a time where there is not significant excess capacity in the industry. The management team has made
large investments in industrial applications through new products and associated footprint to cater to demand in
hydraulics, including a plant in China. These investments should help position Gates well for growth, at a time where
there is modest excess capacity in the industry. However, given recent demand weakness, we expect some pressure
on overall profitability as the new plants will have excess capacity. We assume that Gates' management will look to be
conservative and lower fixed costs through pulling-forward planned restructuring through reduction of production
headcount and selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A) control.

Peer comparison
Gates' past track record of effectively managing its costs with consistent above-average EBITDA margins, modest
capital intensity, and debt reduction after its IPO, will likely support a higher FOCF-to-debt ratio than most of the
entities that we rate 'B', even in a modest downside scenario. Hence, there is a fair likelihood that over time, the
company can sustain credit metrics appropriate for the current rating, given its strong market position and history of
steady cash flow generation.

Financial Risk: Highly leveraged
The quicker-than-expected slowdown in Gates' industrial end markets amid soft conditions in its automotive
end-markets over the next 12-18 months will reduce the likelihood of any significant debt reduction from elevated
levels.
We do not assume any significant deleveraging will occur over the next 24 months months because Blackstone still
retains control of voting power and has pursued an aggressive financial strategy with its other portfolio entities in the
past, using debt and debt-like instruments to maximize shareholder returns.
Following the slight reduction in growth capex in 2019 and 2020, we expect FOCF to improve and stay in line with our
expectations for the rating over the next two years. The company also has a good track record in reducing net working

capital requirements and we assume some improvement in inventory levels through the course of the next 12 months.

Liquidity: Adequate
We believe Gates has adequate liquidity sources to cover its needs over the next 12-18 months or so, even if its
EBITDA were to decline unexpectedly.
Our assessment of Gates' liquidity incorporates the following expectations and assumptions:

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 9, 2019 9

Gates Global LLC

• Liquidity sources, including cash and facility availability, will be at least 1.2x uses or more over the next 12-18
months.
• The company's net sources will remain positive, even if its EBITDA declines by more than 15%.
• We believe Gates has sound relationships with its banks.

Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Cash on hand of about $411 million as of June 30,
2019;

• Annual capital spending normalizing to around $110
million over the next 12 months;

• Total committed borrowing headroom of about
$456.2 million on its asset-backed revolving credit
facility (which had a borrowing base of $325.0
million) and its secured revolving credit facility that
provides for multicurrency revolving loans up to
$185.0 million; and

• Modest working capital outflows in 2019; and
• Manageable debt amortization on the company's
secured term loans.

• Funds from operations of more than $350 million
annually, per our estimates.

Covenant Analysis
We do not expect the springing net leverage ratio test under the company's bank credit facilities (which is triggered
when the availability under the revolving credit facility falls below a certain level) will be triggered under our base case
scenario.

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 9, 2019 10

Gates Global LLC

Other Credit Considerations
We applied a positive one-notch adjustment to our anchor on Gates to reflect the company's ability to generate a
significant free cash flow-to-debt ratio, which we expect will be in the 5%-10% range over the next two years. We
believe Gates' past track record of effectively managing its cost base with consistent above-average EBITDA margins
and modest capital intensity will likely support a somewhat higher FOCF-to-debt ratio than most of the entities that we
rate 'B', even in a modest downside scenario.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

Environmental risks will have an increasing influence in our assessment of Gates' competitive advantage over the
next few years. Gates' fluid power and to a lesser extent, transmission products, will allow it to obtain higher
content per vehicle as more internal combustion engines start to feature start/stop technology on mild and full
hybrids. We also positively view Gates ability to win business by reducing potential environmental hazards at some
industrial customers by offering cleaner and more efficient belt solutions.
Social risks remain manageable because the company has a minimal amount of employees that fall under
collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions relative to most tier 1 suppliers. Risks related to
changing consumer preferences are less likely to directly affect Gates over the next decade because demand for
the company's products will be largely unaffected by trends such autonomous-driving technology. Products like its
advanced belts can ensure more safety by avoiding fire- and slip-related hazards from greasy buildups around
chains.
Governance risks are moderate. Gates will likely extend its record of accomplishment of disciplined capital
allocation and steady cash flow toward deleveraging. We assume large share buybacks, mergers and acquisitions
or dividends will resume if Gates achieves debt reduction goals.

Issue Ratings - Recovery Analysis
• Our '3' recovery rating on Gates' senior secured debt and our '5' recovery rating on the company's unsecured debt
are unchanged.

Key analytical factors
• Our simulated default scenario assumes a payment default in 2023 reflecting a sustained economic downturn that
reduces customer demand for new automobiles, intense pricing pressure from competitors, and execution
challenges related to the ramp-up of new technologies and product offerings;
• This, in turn, would hurt the company's ability to generate free cash flow;
• We valued the company on a going-concern basis using a 5.5x multiple of our projected emergence EBITDA;

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 9, 2019 11

Gates Global LLC

• The senior secured bank debt has a second-lien on the asset-based lending (ABL) revolver's assets and perfected
first-liens on most of the remaining domestic assets;
• We estimate that for the company to default its EBITDA would need to decline by about 40% from estimated 2018
levels, representing a significant deterioration in its business;
• The recovery analysis is dependent on the domestic operations of Gates, but we note that a majority of the
nonguarantors that are 100%-owned also provide 100% pledges of their shares under the credit agreement and ABL
revolver; and
• The majority of the company's U.S. subsidiaries are guarantors of the senior secured credit facilities.

Simulated default assumptions
• LIBOR of 250 bps.
• A 60% draw under the $325 million ABL revolver at default, which is a standard assumption under our criteria. We
assume about $51 million of undrawn letters of credit (LOC) on the facility.
• We believe that if Gates were to default, a viable business model would remain because of its credible customer
base, strong book of business, and competitive global footprint. Therefore, we believe that debt holders would
achieve the greatest recovery value through reorganization rather than through liquidation.
• An 85% draw under the $185 million cash flow revolver at default, which is a standard assumption as per our
criteria.
• We assume the foreign lines of credit are 85% drawn at default.
• Administrative claims of 5% of enterprise value, which is our standard assumption for the auto-supplier sector.
• All debt includes six months of accrued prepetition interest at default.

Simplified waterfall
• Net enterprise value after 5% administrative costs: $1.7 billion
• Priority claims: $147 million
• Collateral value available to secured creditors: $1.3 billion
• Senior secured debt: $2.6 billion
• --Recovery expectations: Meaningful recovery (rounded estimate: 55%)
• Senior unsecured debt: $585 million
• Other pari passu unsecured claims: $1.28 billion
• --Recovery expectations: Modest Recovery (rounded estimate: 10%)
