Overview
Key strengths

Key risks

Strong brand names and No. 1 market position in insulation, and No.
2 positions in residential roofing shingles and composite products.

Exposure to cyclical construction end markets for its roofing and
insulation segments, and a softening industrial outlook for its composites
segment.

Stable outlook supported by solid track record of consistent cash
flow generation.

Roofing segment, which accounts for about 45% of EBIT, sensitive to
storm activity variability.

Increased geographic footprint with recent acquisitions in Europe,
and all segments producing close to 10% EBIT margins or above.

Persistent input cost inflation particularly for asphalt.

We continue to view Owens Corning's outlook as stable despite a softening global industrial outlook. Our forecasts of
slowing U.S. and Eurozone GDP growth rates, as well as contracting to flat construction markets for the rest of 2019,
portend upcoming headwinds. The company has taken steps in response to the changing market environment,
including adjusting prices to maintain market share, and in the case of North American residential fiberglass insulation,
curtailing production to address slowing growth and new entrants. Ultimately, we expect the company to have enough
cushion in its levels of profitability to maintain adjusted leverage in line with the current rating, around 2.7x through
the end of 2019.
We anticipate downward pressure on profitability over the next year. In addition to softening end markets, Owens
Corning has faced ongoing cost inflation that threatens to narrow margins. Though asphalt costs continue to rise,
transportation costs have eased in the U.S. The roofing segment has been successful in offsetting rising costs with price
increases. However, because margins are tighter in the insulation segment, maintaining competitive pricing with a
similar approach is proving to be more challenging. In all segments, the company continues to focus on operational
improvements including automation and other cost cutting initiatives to minimize the impact on absolute profitability.
In this case, as we have seen in the past, we expect the company's balanced market exposure to even out specific
areas of weakness.

Chart 1

In our view, management's focus areas will continue to build on the company's key strengths. Management has outlined
the following areas of focus: organic growth, operating efficiency, and strong free cash flow. Following a two-year
period of sizable acquisitions ending in 2018, Owens Corning expanded its footprint in Europe and achieved the first
quarter of double-digit EBIT margins in all of its segments for the first time. Although headwinds in volumes and
pricing present some top-line pressure, some opportunities for improving efficiencies in recently integrated businesses
exist. The company is also focused on working capital improvements and expects capital spending to be down $65
million for 2019, both of which will contribute to maximizing free cash flow.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects S&P Global Ratings' view that Owens Corning will maintain adjusted leverage in line
with historical levels in the 2x–3x range over the 24 months. Our outlook takes into account the possibility of
continued margin compression from slowing end-market activity in the U.S. and Europe, however, our
assumptions suggest more of a moderate impact on EBITDA. We expect reduced levels of capital spending would
lessen the impact of lower earnings on FOCF, and we also expect that credit measures will benefit from additional
debt prepayments. We believe Owens Corning will finish 2019 with leverage around 2.7x and remain in the 2x–3x
range through 2020.

Downside scenario
We could downgrade Owens Corning if we expect adjusted leverage to be sustained above 3x or free operating
cash flow (FOCF; operating cash flow less capital spending) to debt to be sustained below 15%. This could happen
if the company does not make any additional debt prepayments and if adjusted EBITDA drops over 8%.

Upside scenario
Though unlikely within 24 months, we would also consider an upgrade if the company diversifies its end markets
and reduces its exposure to cyclical construction end markets while maintaining adjusted leverage of around 2.5x
or below. This could happen if the company incorporates a business that contributes significant EBITDA driven by
end markets less correlated to construction end markets.

Our Base-Case Scenario
Based on our macroeconomic assumptions, we expect Owens Corning to increase revenue by just below 2% for 2019,
due to lower GDP growth expectations domestically and abroad still offsetting what we forecast to be shrinking
residential and nonresidential construction spending. We forecast flat to only marginally stronger growth for 2020
assuming construction spending begins to recover. We expect the company will refocus on prepayments on its $600
million term loan due February 2021 (down to $400 million outstanding as of June 30, 2019). The company used the
loan to finance the Paroc acquisition and delayed previous prepayment plans in favor of share repurchases.

• 1.3 million housing starts in both 2019 and 2020.
• Maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO)
spending increasing at about a 2% rate each of the
next two years.
• While we believe that it is highly likely that Owens
Corning could make additional prepayments on its
term loan this year, we assume none for 2019 and
$60 million in prepayments for 2020.

Base-case projections
We expect FOCF to debt to fall back in line with our expectation for the rating after dipping in 2018. According to the
company's guidance, it plans to reduce capital spending by $65 million compared to last year as it pivots from
integration spending to productivity and efficiency initiatives. Other efforts centered on generating free cash flow
including working capital management should bring FOCF to debt back above 15%.
We forecast minimal EBITDA margin deterioration despite tightening end markets. Despite a generally softening global
economic outlook, we anticipate that the company's product mix changes and sustained price increases in some areas
will mitigate instances of decreasing volumes due to flagging demand.

Company Description
Owens Corning produces residential and commercial building materials through its roofing and insulation segments.
Its composites segment supplies a variety of industrial end markets with glass fiber reinforcements and other materials.
The company maintains leading market positions in many of its major product categories and has manufacturing or
distribution facilities throughout North America, Asia, and Europe, with the majority of sales attributable to the U.S.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
Owens Corning has strong, globally recognized brands in building and industrial materials that support the company's
leading market positions in insulation, composites products, and roofing. Owens Corning maintains a No. 1 market

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 26, 2019 5

Owens Corning

position in insulation, and No. 2 positions in the consolidated residential roofing shingles and composites products
markets. Revenue contributions are relatively evenly balanced among the three segments, and we consider the
company's overall profitability to be average among peer building materials producers.
Despite Owens Corning's leading market position and expansive global footprint, the company is subject to highly
cyclical and competitive end markets that temper business prospects. For instance, the insulation segment is
vulnerable to slowing new residential construction markets. Similarly, storm activity can result in some volatility in
roofing demand and earnings, which leads to additional revenue and earnings (or a lack thereof in "quiet" storm years).
However, the roofing business is less susceptible to shifts in construction activity, with approximately 75% - 80% of
roofing demand tied to nondiscretionary roof replacement.

Financial Risk: Intermediate
We expect Owens Corning to end 2019 with leverage around 2.7x and remain in the 2x–3x range in 2020. The
company's next major maturity is the term loan due in February 2021.
We do not anticipate changes in the company's dividend policy over the next two years. However, free cash flow could
be available for share repurchases under the company's existing authorization, which has 3.6 million shares available
for repurchase. Finally, after spending over $2 billion on major acquisitions in 2017/2018, we assume a return to
previous patterns with no major acquisitions incorporated in our projections over the next year.

Liquidity: Strong
We consider Owens Corning's liquidity position to be strong based on the company's cash generation and available
sources compared to operating and capital expenditure needs over the next 24 months.
Our assessment includes the following factors and assumptions:
• Liquidity sources will exceed uses by 2x or more for the upcoming 12 months and remain above 1x over the
subsequent 12-month period.
• Liquidity sources would exceed uses over the next year even if EBITDA declines 30%.
• Sufficient covenant headroom for forecast EBITDA to decline by 30% without the company breaching coverage
tests, and debt at least 25% below covenant limits.
• Well-established, solid relationships with banks as evidenced by the commitments and financing made available for
recent acquisitions.
• Generally prudent risk management with a track record of prioritizing debt prepayments when leverage approaches
3x.

Covenant Analysis
Compliance expectations
We expect the company to remain covenant compliant over the next 24 months.

Requirements
In April 2019, Owens Corning extended the maturity of its $800 million revolving credit facility to 2024. The facility
includes a 2.25x minimum interest expense coverage ratio (also required in the receivables securitization facility
agreement) and a 60% maximum debt to capitalization ratio.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
As of June 30, 2019, borrowings in Owens Corning's capital structure totaled $3.41 billion, including $2.77 billion in
senior unsecured notes maturing 2022–2048, $400 million outstanding on a senior unsecured term loan due in 2021,
and $213 million under its receivables securitization facility maturing in 2022.
In August the company issued a 3.95% $450 million green bond due 2029. Proceeds are funding a tender offer for the
senior notes due 2022 and 2036.

Analytical conclusions
Owens Corning's debt is largely unsecured with its $280 million receivables-securitization commitment the notable
exception. Owens Corning's unsecured debt is rated the same as the 'BBB' issuer credit rating because, in our view, the
proportion of priority debt is low, limiting the risk of subordination for lenders of unsecured debt.
