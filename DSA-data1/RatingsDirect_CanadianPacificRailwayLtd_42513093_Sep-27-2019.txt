Overview
Key strengths

Key risks

Strong market position in Canada and the U.S. Northeast and Midwest with
significant barriers to entry

Exposure to bulk commodities, which are more sensitive to weather
and economic changes

Operating efficiency among the strongest of the North American railroads

Lacks the scale of its main Canadian competitor and some of its U.S.
competitors

Meaningful financial flexibility from consistently strong FOCF

Volumes likely to decline in the event of weaker than expected
macroeconomic conditions

Well-diversified rail network by customer, end market, and region

Strong free cash flow generation provides significant financial flexibility. Under our assumptions of mid-to-high
single-digit revenue growth and modestly higher margins, we estimate CP will generate more than C$3 billion of
operating cash flow per year. This easily covers the C$1.5 billion–C$1.7 billion of capital expenditures in our base-case
scenario and leaves at least C$1.5 billion of free operating cash flow (FOCF) that we assume is used primarily to pay
dividends and repurchase shares, with low impact on leverage.
In our view, CP has significant financial flexibility to manage weaker-than-expected cash flow generation related to
slowing macroeconomic conditions. We would expect the company to reduce share repurchases to an extent that
facilitates positive discretionary cash flow and preserves credit measures--consistent with its track record during past
cycles. In a severe or prolonged recession, CP could also reduce or defer a portion of its dividends and capital
expenditures to limit the impact of lower cash flow on its balance sheet. Notwithstanding short-term pressure on credit
measures likely in such a scenario, we believe CP has the capacity and willingness to generate leverage and cash flow
ratios in line with our long-term expectations. This includes adjusted funds from operations (FFO)-to-debt of 30%-35%
and adjusted debt-to-EBITDA of 2.0x-2.5x, which are consistent with CP's target of achieving an adjusted net
debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.0x-2.5x.

Trade uncertainties and slowing global growth have increased the likelihood of a recession, but we believe CP is well
positioned to manage these risks. We do not believe CP would be materially affected by an escalating trade war, most
notably that between the U.S. and China. In our view, CP's diverse product mix and geographic distribution limit the
company's exposure to any one product category or trade negotiation. For instance, we believe trade between China
and the U.S. represents about 5% of revenue. Furthermore, we believe Canada's trade with the U.S. (about one-third of
CP's freight revenue) is likely to remain steady over the next few years with the United States-Mexico-Canada
Agreement signed late last year. While CP is certainly not immune to financial risk from trade restrictions or tariffs
(since about 70% of freight revenue is generated from cross-border and international trade), its revenue base is highly
diversified by bulk, merchandise, and intermodal shipments. In our view, its broad market exposure underpins the
strength of its business and credit profile.
S&P Global Ratings believes trade uncertainties and a persistent weak global industrial backdrop contribute to a
30%-35% probability of a U.S. recession in the next 12 months. We do not assume a recession in our base-case
assumptions, but we consider how CP might perform in such a scenario. Railroads tend to perform well in industry
downturns, as there is often no alternative shipping mode. We estimate adjusted EBITDA could decline 10%-20% if
the company faces a degree of stress similar to the 2008-2009 downturn. Such a scenario is likely to result in credit
measures that are weaker than we currently expect, potentially including adjusted FFO-to-debt below 23% and
adjusted debt-to-EBITDA above 3x. However, we believe this would be temporary and (as noted above) the company
would manage share repurchases to return adjusted FFO-to-debt above 23% within a two-year period.

CP is among the most efficient railways in North America. We expect CP's operating efficiency to remain among the
strongest of the North American railroads, underpinned by our forecast adjusted EBIT margins of about 40%, which
we consider above average for Class 1 railroads. The modest improvement in profitability within our forecast, despite
challenging weather conditions in first-quarter 2019, stems primarily from mid-to-high single-digit annual revenue
growth we assume along with ongoing investments the company is making to upgrade its network and renew its
equipment (new grain hoppers and locomotives).
In our view, CP's solid operating performance is a testament to the benefits of the precision scheduled railroading
model the company implemented in 2012. Having ingrained this operating model into its business well before its U.S.
peers, the company has, we believe, a relatively lower risk of service disruptions.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects S&P Global Ratings' expectation that over the next few years, CP's adjusted
FFO-to-debt should be 30%-35%, supported by strong demand across most of the products in the company's
portfolio. Our ratings also place an emphasis on the company's adherence to its financial policies that include a
target net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.0x-2.5x.

Downside scenario
We could downgrade CP within the next two years if we expect adjusted FFO-to-debt to be below 23%. This could
occur if the company adopts more-aggressive financial policies or if earnings are significantly weaker than we
expect, potentially due to lower volumes and pricing brought on by a severe recession.

Upside scenario
Although unlikely over the next two years, we could upgrade CP if stronger-than-expected earnings growth
contributes to adjusted FFO-to-debt above 35% and adjusted FOCF-to-debt above 15%. In this scenario, we would
expect the company to sustain these stronger credit measures, supported by financial policies that are more
conservative than our current view.

• Canadian CPI growth of about 2% per year.
• Average value of the Canadian dollar to be relatively
flat against the U.S. dollar.
• Mid-to-high single-digit annual revenue growth

• Annual capital expenditures of C$1.5 billion–C$1.7
billion through 2020.
• Annual dividend payments of C$400 million-C$450
million through 2020.
• Annual share repurchases of C$1.1 billion-C$1.3
billion through 2020 funded with FOCF remaining
after paying dividends and a modest increase in
debt.
• Upcoming debt maturities are refinanced.

Base-case projections
Strong demand expected to spur low-to-mid single-digit volume and yield growth leading to mid-to-high single-digit
revenue growth. We expect strong demand in the majority of CP's product portfolio will fuel growth in consolidated
volumes and pricing, largely due to a still solid macroeconomic environment and tight capacity across various modes
of transportation. We expect this environment will foster mid-to-high single-digit annual revenue growth for the
company over the next couple of years. During the first half of 2019, freight revenue was up about 10%, with eight out
of nine product segments up from last year. We assume economic growth in the second half of this year should slow
modestly, resulting in mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth for 2019. We expect mid-single-digit revenue growth in
2020, fueled by favorable macroeconomic conditions and new business wins, including a three-year agreement for CP
to handle all of Yang Ming Marine Transport Corp.'s Vancouver traffic (intermodal) effective Jan. 1, 2020. We also see
strong demand for crude oil by rail (about 5% of revenue in 2018), at least through 2020, due to delays in new pipeline
capacity.

Company Description
CP is a Canadian Class I railway that primarily serves Canada, as well as the Midwestern and Northeastern U.S. It
operates a network of about 12,500 route miles serving the principal business centers of Canada, from Montreal to
Vancouver, as well as the U.S. Midwest and Northeast. In 2018, the company generated more than C$7 billion of
revenue, making it the second-largest railroad in Canada (about half the size of Canadian National Railway Ltd. [CN])
and the sixth-largest in North America.

Business Risk: Strong
We believe CP should benefit from the limited competition from alternate modes of long-haul commercial freight
transport within the North American railroad industry, significant barriers to entry, moderate degree of cyclicality, and
ability to increase freight pricing in excess of rail inflation (including fuel costs). Likewise, the company's strong market
position in Canada and the U.S. Northeast and Midwest and well-situated rail network support the ratings.
Trucking is a competitive alternative on short-haul routes and for time-sensitive freight, and barges and vessels offer
competition on the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Seaway. However, rail remains an attractive and cost-effective choice for
bulk and long-distance commodity traffic, in our opinion.
We expect CP's operating efficiency to remain among the strongest of the North American railroads, underpinned by
our forecast adjusted EBIT margins of about 40%, which we consider above average for Class 1 railroads and about in
line withCN. The modest expected improvement in profitability stems primarily from the benefits of operating leverage
given the mid-single-digit annual revenue growth we assume along with ongoing investments the company is making
to upgrade its network and renew its equipment (new grain hoppers and locomotives).
In our view, CP should continue to generate stable earnings due in large part to its geographic, customer, and product
diversity. This typically allows the company to offset weak demand in certain sectors with strong performance in
others. Moreover, fuel surcharge mechanisms are included in most of the company's freight contracts--as is common
in the rail industry, albeit there can sometimes be a lag before rates reset. We believe these mechanisms should
mitigate CP's cost exposure to volatile fuel prices, further supporting our view of the company's earnings stability.

Peer comparison
We believe the degree of CP's diversification is weaker than that of its Canadian and some U.S. peers due to the
company's significant exposure to bulk commodities. These include coal, grain, potash, and fertilizer products, which
we believe exhibit greater volatility in freight volumes, because of higher relative exposure to unpredictable weather
and economic fluctuations. Bulk commodities represented about 41% of CP's freight revenue in 2018 compared with
about 22% for CN. In our opinion, CP also lacks the larger scale of its Canadian rival, and of some of its U.S.
competitors, in particular Burlington Northern Santa Fe and Union Pacific. Larger rail networks typically benefit from
better customer, end-market, and geographic diversity, along with access to more ports and terminals to better serve
customers.
From a financial risk perspective, we believe CP is comparable with most of the other Class 1 railroads except for CN,
which we expect will maintain relatively more conservative credit measures.

Financial Risk: Intermediate
We expect adjusted FFO-to-debt of 30%-35% and adjusted debt-to-EBITDA of 2.0x-2.5x over the next few years. We
consider these credit measures to be at the stronger end of our acceptable range for the rating. We assume annual
adjusted EBITDA growth in the high single-digit area as freight volumes and rates continue to rise through 2020. We
also believe that the company will deploy all of the FOCF it generates along with proceeds from modest debt increases
to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Our forecast for improving credit measures is also
consistent with the company's target to improve adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA (based on CP's methodology)
to 2.0x-2.5x over the long term from 2.6x at the end of 2018.
Under our assumptions, CP should generate C$1.4 billion-C$1.6 billion of annual FOCF over the next couple of years
after C$1.5 billion-C$1.7 billion of capital expenditures (about equal to 20%-22% of revenue). This translates into
adjusted FOCF-to-debt of 14%-17% through 2020. While we anticipate this cash flow will primarily go toward
repurchasing shares, we also note that through its ability to redeploy this cash, CP has the financial flexibility to remain
opportunistic regarding investments that may strengthen its competitive position or reduce debt to maintain steady
leverage measures if earnings decline.

Liquidity: Strong
Our liquidity assessment incorporates our view that CP's sources of liquidity will exceed uses by more than 1.5x over
the next 12 months. We also expect that the company will maintain sufficient liquidity to exceed its funding needs
even in a stress scenario whereby our forecast EBITDA declines by 30%. Furthermore, we believe CP has the capacity
to withstand a high-impact, low-probability event with limited need for refinancing; well-established and solid banking
relationships; generally high standing in credit markets with great access to capital markets; and generally very
prudent financial risk management.
We have a short-term rating of 'A-2' on Canadian Pacific Railway Co. (a subsidiary of CP), which reflects our 'BBB+'
long-term issuer credit rating and strong liquidity profile on CP.

• Annual dividend payments of C$400 million-C$450
million.

• Annual FFO of more than C$3.0 billion.

Covenant Analysis
Compliance expectations
We believe there is sufficient headroom under CP's financial covenants for EBITDA to be 30% lower than our forecast
without the company breaching its covenant limits.

Requirements
The company's revolving credit facility includes a financial covenant that limits its debt-to-EBITDA.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

ESG factors are not a major influence on the rating on CP. Transportation of energy, chemical, and plastic products
that we consider CP's most hazardous line of business represented a modest 12% of carloads in 2018. We believe
the railroad is among the safest in North America based on Federal Railroad Administration reporting criteria. That
said, operations tend to be more challenging in Canada than in the U.S. due to colder weather conditions and
steeper grades, particularly in parts of Western Canada. CP operates a fuel efficient fleet of locomotives that on
average used 0.95 U.S. gallons per thousand gross ton miles in 2018, which we believe is about 15% lower than the
average North American railway. We also believe transporting freight by rail instead of trucks is significantly more
fuel efficient on average, contributing to lower greenhouse gas emissions and higher relative profitability. We
expect service levels to remain relatively stable over the next few years. CP's customers and employees are not
being disrupted by a transition to scheduled railroading, as CP was an early adopter of this operating model, having
implemented it in 2012. Furthermore, while about 75% of the company's workforce is unionized, its labor relations
have been relatively stable. The company is publicly held, with a highly regarded management team and good
governance practices.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
As of June 30, 2019, CP's capital structure consists of about C$8.5 billion of unsecured debt and less than C$300
million of secured debt outstanding at subsidiary Canadian Pacific Railway Co.

Analytical conclusions
• We rate the company's unsecured notes 'BBB+', the same as the issuer credit rating, as no significant elements of
subordination risk are present in the capital structure.
• We rate the secured equipment notes due 2024 'A', two notches higher than the issuer credit rating, based on our
view that equipment creditors are likely to continuing receiving payments at contracted rates during a railroad
reorganization scenario, as well as on the relatively stable value of the railroad equipment securing the debt.
• We rate less than C$50 million of perpetual 4% consolidated debenture stock 'AA-' to reflect the credit risk of the
Canadian banks that have provided a letter of credit to support the obligation.
