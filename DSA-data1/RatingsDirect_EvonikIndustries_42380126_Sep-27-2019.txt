Key Risks

Leading global specialty-chemicals manufacturer with healthy market positions.

Cyclicality of some chemical activities and exposure to
volatile raw material prices.

Significantly reduced exposure to cyclical and/or commoditized products
following disposal of methyl methacrylates (MMA) business.

High concentration of revenue from the developed markets
of Western Europe and North America.

Average but resilient profitability overall, with potential improvement over the
medium term thanks to cost saving initiatives.

Significant post-retirement obligations.

Successful integration of recent acquisitions.
Supportive financial policy and management's commitment to a solid
investment-grade rating.

The sale of the MMA business is an important step in the transformation of specialty chemicals group Evonik Industries
(Evonik). The sale of the mature and capital-intensive MMA business has materially reduced the cyclicality of Evonik's
portfolio and should result in more resilient profitability. In line with its strategy, S&P Global Ratings expects the
company will continue to sharpen its focus on specialty chemicals and its identified growth areas--health and care,
smart materials, specialty additives, and animal nutrition.
The proceeds from the MMA disposal will be used to pursue the company's current strategy.We understand that Evonik
will use the proceeds, after deductions (such as pension obligations and cash tax payments), to strengthen its balance
sheet and fund internal and external growth projects. These include the $625 million acquisition of U.S.-based
chemicals producer PeroxyChem, and the construction of a €400 million polyamide 12 plant in Marl, Germany. Based
on this, we expect credit metrics to remain comfortably at the upper end of our guidance for the current rating.

Outlook: Stable

The outlook is stable because we expect Evonik will generate solid adjusted EBITDA of €2.0 billion-€2.2 billion in
2019, despite headwinds from some end markets such as auto, and €2.1 billion- €2.3 billion in 2020. We also factor
in Evonik's financial policy commitment to a solid investment-grade rating and anticipate that dividends and
acquisitions (if any) will be financed prudently. We view a ratio of adjusted funds from operations (FFO) to debt of
30%-40% as commensurate with the rating.

Downside scenario
We could lower the ratings if we anticipated that our adjusted FFO to debt would decline below 30% without the
near-term prospect of recovery. This could be caused by a significant drop in profit due to a weaker market
environment, or come through material debt-funded acquisitions.

Upside scenario
Upside rating potential could emerge over time if Evonik can maintain resilient performance via a higher share of
specialty chemicals in its product portfolio, visible EBITDA contributions from acquisitions and expansion projects,
and a financial track record of adjusted FFO to debt in the 40%-45% range--including increased free cash flow after
dividends. A financial policy commitment to a higher rating would be important for any upgrade considerations.

• Modest segmental growth with nutrition and care
affected by the softer methionine market and

environment.
• Gross proceeds from the MMA sale of €3 billion.
• Spending of about €700 million for acquisitions in
2019, mainly on PeroxyChem assuming the
transaction closes by year-end, and continued
bolt-on acquisitions in 2020-2021. We note the
somewhat uncertain timing of the PeroxyChem
transaction, which is currently delayed by a lawsuit
filed by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
• Capital expenditure (capex) of €0.9 billion-€1 billion
per year.
• Dividends of €0.5 billion-€0.6 billion per year.

Base-case projections
We expect Evonik to replace MMA's EBITDA contribution through acquisitions and organic investments. We forecast
adjusted EBITDA of €2.0 billion-€2.2 billion in 2019, down from €2.4 billion in 2018 due to the sale of MMA, before
increasing to €2.1 billion-€2.3 billion from 2020 onward. We factor in the synergy realization from recent acquisitions,
benefits from cost savings programs, and organic growth projects such as the polyamide 12 capacity in Marl.
Evonik enjoys ample rating headroom. We anticipate ample headroom for the rating due to improving credit metrics.
For example, we forecast FFO to debt to improve toward the higher end of our 30%-40% guidance thanks to support
from excess funds available and the disposal of the cyclical MMA business. Despite continued strong cash conversion,
we believe that Evonik will utilize its cash flows for investments, modest acquisitions, and dividends, resulting in a
relatively stable leverage over the forecast period.

Company Description
Evonik is one of the leading specialty chemical companies, with about €6.5 billion of revenue reported from continuing
operations in first-half 2019.

The group's activities comprise three segments: Nutrition and care, resource efficiency, and performance materials.
Evonik serves a range of diversified end markets including food and animal feed, consumer and personal care, and
auto and mechanical engineering.
In nutrition and care, Evonik is the world's largest producer of methionine, used in animal (mainly poultry) feed, and
the group considers this to be one of its most important profit contributors. The segment also makes cosmetic
ingredients, such as specialty surfactants, and household products including fabric conditioners, solutions for the
health care industry and superabsorbent materials.
In resource efficiency, the company produces inorganic materials, such as silica and silanes for tires, coatings and
adhesive resins, oil additives for the auto and industrial end markets, crosslinkers, polyamide 12, and hydrogen
peroxide used in pulp and paper bleaching, and other applications.
In performance materials, the company produces naphtha-based C4 derivatives and hydrocyanic acid products, as
well as alkoxides that are used, among other things, for the manufacture of biodiesel.
On March 4, 2019, Evonik signed an agreement to sell its MMA business to Advent for €3 billion. The MMA business
comprised large-volume monomers such as methylmethacrylate, various specialty monomers, and the PLEXIGLAS®
brand of PMMA molding compounds and semi-finished products. The methacrylate business has been reclassified to
discontinued operations. The transaction closed on July 31, 2019.

Business Risk: Strong
Evonik's business risk profile is underpinned by the size and strong market position of its specialty chemicals activities,
as well as global market reach. The specialty business portfolio was further strengthened by the sale of the mature and
cyclical MMA business.
Evonik benefits from greater diversity in terms of end markets and product ranges than most of its peers, while at the
same time there are limited synergies between its rather-unrelated business units. About one-third of its sales come
from nutrition and care products, with less than 20% from the more cyclical auto end markets and well-diversified
exposure to other end markets. The group also has a good track record in research and development, which accounts
for 3.0%-3.5% of its annual sales.
We view Evonik's profitability as average within the specialty chemicals industry, supported by efficiency programs in
group-wide selling, general, and administrative functions. The company is targeting savings of €200 million by 2021
and in addition has several business-specific initiatives like 'OLEO 2020' for household and personal care.
The company's exposure to commoditized and/or cyclical products including amino acids, C4 derivatives, and

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 4, 2019 7

Evonik Industries

superabsorbers for baby care has reduced compared with a few years ago, but is still material. This has resulted from
Evonik expanding in more stable activities but also the current trough in conditions. Cyclical products could represent
a material portion of Evonik's EBITDA if prices normalize. We see this as a weakness for the group, given the higher
volatility of these products compared with the rest of its offerings and their sensitivity to economic cycles and
supply-demand balances. However, we note the much smaller proportion of Evonik's profits stemming from one key
product, methionine.
We note that Evonik has built its second methionine plant in Singapore, doubling its production capacity in the country
to 300,000 metric tons per year. The decision to expand reflects the 5%-6% growth in demand for methionine, fueled
by the professionalization of meat production. However, the oversupply situation is continuing and we expect little
recovery in methionine prices during the remainder of 2019. That said, we recognize Evonik's first quartile cost
position thanks to its backward integration and technological expertise in complex methionine production, both of
which support the profitability of the methionine business even at the current low point in the cycle.
We note the enhancements to diversity thanks to recent acquisitions, and recognize Evonik's strategy to accelerate
growth and attain a sustainable EBITDA margin of 18%-20% on average over the cycle through cost efficiencies and a
further shift toward specialty chemicals. In our view, a track record of sustainably better and stable margins would be a
key indication of the strengthening business profile, with the MMA business disposal an important milestone on this
path.

Financial Risk: Intermediate
Our view of Evonik's financial risk profile takes into account the group's FFO to debt of close to 40% in 2019 under our
base-case scenario, which is within the 30%-40% range commensurate with the ratings.
During first-half 2019, Evonik generated adjusted EBITDA of about €1.1 billion, leading to an FFO of about €0.8
billion. This is moving in line with our base-case estimates of about €2.1 billion of EBITDA and about €1.9 billion of
FFO for full-year 2019. Over the course of 2019-2020, we also anticipate Evonik will generate strong free operating
cash flow of €0.6 billion-€0.7 billion, allowing the company to deleverage gradually. We also assume that the company
will continue its focus on high-margin businesses via internal initiatives and external opportunities, with the proceeds
from the sale of the MMA business to be mainly utilized to pursue future growth opportunities rather than
deleveraging.
We note Evonik's financial policy commitment to a solid investment-grade rating and assume that capex, dividends
and future acquisitions (if any) will be balanced appropriately or prudently funded. This was demonstrated by the
issuance of a €500 million intermediate equity content hybrid instrument to finance the acquisition of the Huber Silica
business in 2017.

Liquidity: Strong
We view Evonik's liquidity as strong based on our estimate that sources will exceed uses by 1.6x over the 12 months
from June 30, 2019, and 1.5x over the subsequent 12 months. Evonik's debt documentation does not include any
covenants and the group has a track record of addressing its maturities well ahead of time.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• At June 30, 2019, about €0.5 billion of estimated
cash and liquid investments.

• Short-term debt of €0.9 billion at June 30, 2019.

• A €1.75 billion undrawn revolving credit facility
(RCF) maturing in 2024. The facility is not subject to
any financial covenants.

• Assumed capex of about €1 billion, of which €0.5
billion is maintenance capex.
• Dividends of €0.5 billion-€0.6 billion.

• FFO of €1.6 billion-€1.7 billion over the next 12
months, according to our base-case credit scenario.

• Moderate working capital outflows of about €0.15
billion in the next 12 months, including €0.1 billion
of peak intrayear working capital needs.

• Net proceeds from the MMA business sale of about
€2 billion.

• About €0.7 billion for acquisitions.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

We consider Evonik's exposure to environmental risk factors as on par with the chemical sector. The company has
established a group-wide environment, safety, health, and quality management system based on statutory and
normative frameworks, including ISO standards, the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and internal regulations.
It has already been able to reduce its absolute greenhouse gas emissions by about 30% since 2008, and has set a
target to reduce emissions by another 20% by 2025. In addition, Evonik introduced internal CO2 pricing as
additional criteria in the management of major investments. Evonik uses co-generation plants at several of its large
sites. It announced plans to replace the last coal-fired power plant at its Marl site by 2022, and has integrated
structures linking chemical production and energy generation. In 2018, Evonik spent €43 million on environmental
protection, compared to a total of €340 million since 2012. The company also generates approximately 50% of its
sales from products and solutions that help improve resource efficiency in customers' applications. We believe
social factors are currently not a material risk for the rating. Furthermore, we view Evonik's governance as a
supportive factor for the ratings, reflecting management's experience and expertise, governance fully in line with
best practices, and the balance of different stakeholders' interests.
