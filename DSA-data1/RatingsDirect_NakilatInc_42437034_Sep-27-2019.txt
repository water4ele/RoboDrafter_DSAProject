Concentrated client base.

High vessel availability.

Nakilat Inc. (Nakilat) is a key player in Qatar's LNG export strategy. S&P Global Ratings believes Nakilat plays a
critical role in the LNG export industry, which is vital for the Qatari economy, and has a very strong link with the
Qatari state. Therefore, we believe that Nakilat could benefit from extraordinary government support from Qatar
during times of stress. Nakilat is a wholly owned subsidiary of Qatar Gas Transportation Company (QGTC). The latter
is 50% owned by government entities and its chairman (currently the Minister of Energy) is appointed by Qatar
Petroleum through a special right under the QGTC shareholders' agreement. QGTC is the owner of the world's largest
LNG fleet and accounts for nearly 12% of worldwide LNG shipments.
The company's 25-year offtake agreements underpin its stable cash flows. Nakilat has entered into long-term charter
agreements (25-year terms) with local LNG producer Qatargas for the use of its 25 LNG vessels. Moreover, the charter
agreements ensure a stable cash inflow to Nakilat through availability-based payments. Therefore, the company is not
exposed to market risk.
Nakilat benefits from high vessel availability. Nakilat's vessels (Q-Max and Q-Flax) have demonstrated consistent and
high availability of approximately 99%. Combined with the availability-based payment mechanism, this results in very
low revenue volatility.
The company is exposed to interest-rate risk. Nakilat has nearly $1.0 billion of debt unhedged and exposed to London
Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) fluctuations (20% of total debt). However, this is largely mitigated by the current low
level of LIBOR, the high debt coverage ratios of the company, and the natural hedge by way of cash balances.
Nakilat is dependent on one main customer. Customer concentration is high, given the company's vessels dedicated to
Qatargas, which merged with RasGas in 2018. However, Qatargas is a highly creditworthy counterparty and the
world's largest LNG producer, with production capacity of 77 million tons per annum (MTA).

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on Nakilat mirrors that on Qatar. The outlook reflects our view of Nakilat's importance to
Qatar's economy and strategy for LNG, which accounts for about 40% of the country's GDP. We consider Nakilat a
government-related entity (GRE) and see an extremely high likelihood that, in the event of financial stress, the
Qatar government would provide timely support for Nakilat's debt service requirements.

Downside scenario
We could downgrade Nakilat following a sovereign downgrade. We believe that Nakilat will likely remain critical to
Qatar's strategy for LNG exports. We continue to monitor the political sanctions on Qatar and disruptions to the
flow of vessels through the Strait of Hormuz, along with the effect on Nakilat's ability to operate and generate
stable earnings. However, this effect has been minimal to date. Over the longer term, we could lower the rating if
we regarded Nakilat's role as no longer critical to Qatar's LNG distribution due to a change in the government's
strategy. The rating could also come under pressure if the EBITDA interest coverage ratio fell sustainably below
2.0x, down from 2.3x for the rolling 12 months to June 30, 2019.

Upside scenario
An upgrade could result from an upgrade of the sovereign, all other factors remaining constant.

Our Base-Case Scenario
Our forecast incorporates the assumption that Nakilat's long-term charter contracts will remain in place for the next 12
years.

Assumptions

• Positive revenue growth of 0.4% in the next two
years as a portion of charter revenue is linked to the
rate of inflation.
• Stable cost base, reflecting no exposure to changes
in fuel and personnel expenses, which are borne by
the charterers as stipulated in the long-term charter
contracts.

• Annual capital expenditure (capex) of about $10
million, mainly to cover dry dock expenses, which
we expect to remain relatively stable. We do not
expect any immediate newbuilding capex, given the
oversupply of LNG vessels in the global market and
Nakilat's prudent investment strategy.
• Maintenance of a six-month debt service reserve
account, as well as available cash to service debt for
the next six months. Based on this cash availability
and the dividend lock-up being met, we assume
dividend payments of about $136 million for 2019.

Base-case projections
We expect operating margins to remain stable due to the offtake nature and stability of operating costs.The capex
required for dry docking is relatively low at approximately $10 million per year, or 1.5% of projected EBITDA.
However, given that the company's debt fully amortizes over its term, this will push debt and interest coverage ratios
upward over time.

Company Description
Nakilat operates as a subsidiary of QGTC. The latter is one of the largest LNG transportation companies in the world
by capacity, with 69 wholly and jointly owned LNG carriers, four liquefied petroleum gas vessels, and one floating
storage regasification unit (FSRU). QGTC provides shipping and marine-related services to a range of participants
within the Qatari hydrocarbon sector.
As a core subsidiary of QGTC, Nakilat was established to handle the shipping requirements of Qatar's largest LNG
producers. It owns and operates a fleet of 25 vessels--11 Qatar-Flex type, and 14 Qatar-Max type. These are two of the
world's largest and most advanced LNG vessel types, with 50% and 80% more cargo capacity, respectively than
conventional LNG carriers.

SEPTEMBER 11, 2019 5

Nakilat Inc.

Business Risk: Strong
Although we view the shipping industry as a high-risk sector, Nakilat's established role in shipping LNG around the
world, its strategic importance to the Qatari government, and its long-term fixed charter contracts with Qatar's largest
LNG producers mitigate risks that may arise from LNG price volatility or weak charter rates.
We expect Nakilat to maintain its long-term time charter contracts for the next 12 years with Qatar's largest LNG
producers--the largest exporters in the world--which insulates it from potential cost increases. The company operates
with availability-based payment streams under time charter contracts, meaning that the charterer pays for fuel costs,
port charges, commissions, and a daily hire fee to Nakilat whether the vessel is being used or not. If, for example,
bunker costs increased materially, the charterers would bear the additional cost.
Nakilat also has good geographic coverage, shipping LNG cargoes to more than 25 countries. Although the Qatari
government is suffering from the effects of the ongoing Saudi-led boycott, there is no indication that Qatar's main
trading partners Japan, South Korea, China, and India, which purchase the bulk of its LNG, will reconsider their
existing trade arrangements. These four countries account for 55% of Qatar's total exports and depend on LNG as an
energy source.
Additional factors supporting our assessment of Nakilat's business profile include:
• Its reliable operating track record since the delivery of the first vessel in August 2008, with vessel reliability above
99% for the past five years.
• The healthy credit quality of charterer Qatargas, an operating subsidiary of government-owned Qatar Petroleum
(AA-/Stable/--) and the largest LNG producer in the world.
• Comprehensive insurance policies, including war risk insurance. Together with various provisions under the charter
agreements, these policies cover Nakilat against political stress scenarios, such as the hypothetical closure of the
Strait of Hormuz for about 30 months.
These positive factors are only partly offset by Nakilat's:
• Exposure to loss-of-vessel incidents, as well as certain uninsured risks, including weather and terrorist events.
• High exposure to two customers, although counterbalanced by their high credit quality.

Peer comparison
In our view, Nakilat is one of the strongest shipping companies in the world. Although peers such as PAO Sovcomflot,
Teekay Corp., and A/P Moller Maersk are top industry players, they are less resilient to economic downturns due to
their spot exposure or, in the case of AP Moller Maersk, exposure to riskier segments such as containerships.
PAO Sovcomflot and Teekay Corp. are among the top-three largest tanker companies in the world that also provide
offshore supply services. However, their share of revenue coming from LNG, which is somewhat more stable than
conventional oil, is relatively low. Unlike Nakilat, both companies have a share of their fleet on spot rates, which
reduces cash flow visibility and might affect profitability during market downturns. For example, Nakilat has secured
rates well in excess of LNG spot charter rates, which have been in the range of $60,000 per day in 2018. Since Nakilat
benefits from fixed-price, long-term charter contracts, its earnings are stable and its EBITDA margins remain high.
This makes the company more resilient to the macroeconomic environment than peers.

Financial Risk: Aggressive
Since Nakilat was awarded 25-year charter contracts in 2006 and 2007, it has sustained credit ratios close to current
levels. These include debt to EBITDA of about 7.0x and funds from operations (FFO) to debt of 7%-8%, which we
forecast will slightly improve as the company amortizes bank debt.
Although we take into account the relatively weak leverage metrics, our assessment of Nakilat's financial risk profile
reflects our forecast that the company's ratio of EBITDA interest coverage will remain above 2.0x over 2019-2020. In
our opinion, EBITDA interest coverage is the correct indicator of the company's future financial leverage due to its
predictable cash flows and interest-rate payments. Moreover, required capex is low for the coming years, which should
support the company's stability and visibility of free operating cash flow (FOCF).

Liquidity: Strong
We assess Nakilat's liquidity as strong. We expect the company's sources of liquidity to cover uses by more than 1.5x
over the next 12 months and over 1.0x for the subsequent 12 months. We also expect Nakilat to maintain a sound cash
position given its conservative financial policies. These include reserve accounts for debt service and dividend
coverage ratios, which limits any cash upstream from the entity to its parent, QGTC.
Our liquidity assessment also factors in the company's sound relationship with top-tier banks and its high standing in
the credit markets, mainly due to its strong relationship with the Qatari government.

Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

We estimate liquidity sources for the coming 12
months from June 30, 2019, include:

We estimate liquidity uses for the same period include:

• Cash and cash equivalents of $357 million.

• Debt amortization of $247 million for the next 12
months.

• Cash flow from operations of approximately $400
million.

• Annual dividend distributions of approximately $150
million for the next two years.
• Annual capex corresponding to dry dock
maintenance of about $10 million.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

We consider environmental, social, and governance factors, and particularly environmental factors, relevant for
our ratings on Nakilat, as an entity operating in the transportation industry.
Nakilat has a good track record of safety performance with a Lost Time Incident Frequency (LTIF) of 0.05 in 2018,
compared with an industry average of 0.48. It strives to improve vessel fuel consumption and reduce gas emissions
through the implementation of monitoring systems, engine upgrades (vessels burning natural gas instead of
conventional heavy fuel oil) and propeller/hull coating works. All of Nakilat's LNG carriers are Green Award
certified.
We assess Nakilat's management and governance as satisfactory, underpinned by a strong operational track
record. As a fully owned subsidiary of a listed entity (QGTC), Nakilat is subject to Qatar Stock Exchange corporate
governance rules. That said, its board is dominated by representatives of government and government-related
entities and Qatar Petroleum holds a golden share, meaning it has the right to appoint the chairman and the vice
chairman. This leaves the company with limited independent oversight.
The company is not subject to any nationalization requirements, but was awarded for its efforts in employing
nationals in 2017. Qataris accounted for 37.5% of the workforce in first-half 2019.

Other Credit Considerations
Our analysis incorporates Nakilat's ability to obtain financing from domestic and regional banks and capital markets at
compellingly low rates that are better than peers'. In our view, this indicates a market perception that lending to
Nakilat is broadly equivalent to lending to the Qatari government.

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 11, 2019 10

Nakilat Inc.

Government Influence
Our rating incorporates Nakilat's continued importance to Qatar's strategy for LNG distribution around the world.
Nakilat's vessels cover about 40% of the transportation requirements of Qatar's LNG industry, which represents 50% of
government revenue.
In our view, the Qatari government is extremely likely to provide timely and sufficient extraordinary support to Nakilat
if needed. This view is also supported by the substantial oversight and involvement that government officials have on
Nakilat's financing and strategy. As a result, we apply five notches of uplift to the 'bbb-' stand-alone credit profile to
arrive at the long-term issuer credit rating of 'A+'.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
All debt is issued by Nakilat Inc., the parent company and principal operating entity.

Capital structure
Nakilat's capital structure comprises $5.0 billion of secured debt (including $850 million senior secured notes) and $617
million of subordinated debt and subordinated notes.

Analytical conclusions
We rate Nakilat's senior secured notes at the same level as the long-term issuer credit rating because it ranks pari
passu with bank debt. We rate Nakilat's subordinated debt one notch lower than the issuer credit rating because it
ranks behind a significant amount of secured debt in the capital structure.
