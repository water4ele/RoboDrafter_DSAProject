Key Risks

Leading position in the global independent leaf tobacco processing
industry with longstanding customer relationships.

Highly concentrated product focus in tobacco leaf, an industry facing
secular decline in global consumption.

Track record of conservative financial policies and sustained modest
leverage.

Uncertainty around impact of heightened regulatory risk.

Long history of relatively consistent profitability and free cash flow
generation.

Although cigarette volume declines have been accelerating, we view the potential ban on certain next generation
products (NGP) as a likely tailwind for the company's operations. One of the key factors driving the accelerating
volume declines of tobacco leaf has been lower demand for cigarettes driven by growing consumer willingness to
switch to alternative products, such as e-cigarettes. Amid growing concerns about the health risks posed by vaping and
the evolving regulatory environment, adult consumers would likely revert to cigarettes as e-cigarettes become harder
to buy reversing the decade-long decline in smoking rates. This, combined with Universal Corp.'s (Universal's) high
levels (highest since fiscal 2015) of uncommitted tobacco leaf inventories, could result in better processing and sales
volumes growth rates.

We expect the company will maintain a conservative financial policy consistent with our ratings even as it explores
additional investment opportunities. Universal has a well-established track record of conservative financial policies
including minimal share repurchases as a proportion of its total authorization, which have been sufficiently covered by
its free cash flow generation. Thus far, the company has not been as active in mergers and acquisitions (M&A)
spending as its competitor, Pyxus International, and has maintained its focus on core tobacco leaf operations. The

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 25, 2019 3

Universal Corp.

company announced that it is now in the process of identifying future acquisition opportunities to expand its business
into adjacent agribusiness industries and mitigate the impact of tobacco consumption declines. However, we believe it
will continue taking a disciplined approach to investments. We believe possible future acquisitions will be capitalized
such that the company's leverage does not exceed the 2x area, leaving significant headroom to our downgrade trigger.
Profitability and free cash flow generation will remain robust.Although the company will continue to face a tough
operating landscape, given that its core market remains under pressure, we believe cash flow generation remains
healthy. We believe the company will generate approximately $130 million of annual operating cash flows, which
should sufficiently cover its annual capital expenditures of about $45 million and dividends of about $75 million while
leverage modestly declines. Debt to EBITDA for the trailing-12-months ended June 30, 2019, totaled 1.6x and we
project leverage will decline to the 1.0x area by fiscal year-end 2020, driven by lower seasonally-elevated debt
balances and modest EBITDA growth.

Outlook

The stable outlook reflects our expectation that Universal will sustain leverage near or below 1.5x and EBITDA
interest coverage above 10x over the next 12-24 months. Improving crop supplies, supply chain efficiency
improvements, coupled with the expectation that Universal will not meaningfully increase debt for acquisitions
support our expectations.

Downside scenario
We could lower the ratings if we forecast weaker credit measures, including debt to EBITDA sustained above 2x
and EBITDA interest coverage below 10x, which we estimate could occur if year-end debt increases by about $100
million or annual EBITDA falls 15%-20%. This would most likely occur if crop levels largely decline in the
company's tobacco source regions or from significant price volatility. Several factors can lead to price volatility,
including periodic supply gluts or noncompetitive pricing in certain regions, changes in procurement strategies by
Universal's large cigarette customers (including an increase in direct sourcing), or changes in macroeconomic
conditions (including extreme foreign exchange movements or heightened country risk, particularly in Africa or
Brazil). In addition, if tobacco leaf sourced from Brazil increases to 25% or more of Universal's total sourcing
needs, we could consider its Federal Republic of Brazil sovereign risk exposure material, resulting in a possible
downgrade.

Upside scenario
A higher rating is much less likely, but could occur if there is a significant shift in the company's business risk
profile, such as if it broadens its product portfolio beyond tobacco leaf or if more business is outsourced by tobacco
manufacturers to independent suppliers, resulting in higher market share and profits.

Our Base-Case Scenario

SEPTEMBER 25, 2019 4

Universal Corp.

Assumptions

• U.S. GDP growth rate of 2.5% in 2019 and 1.8% in
2020. World GDP growth rate of 3.3% in 2019 and
3.6% in 2020.
• Low-single-digit sales growth in fiscal year 2020
(ending March 2020) driven by higher demand for
wrapper tobacco, strong carry over sales in Brazil,
and increased volumes in Asia; offset by weaker
performance in U.S. due to oversupply of flue-cured
and burley tobacco and ongoing declines in
consumer demand for traditional combustible
cigarettes.

• Beyond 2020, we expect sales growth in the
low-single-digits as increased sales volumes to
major customers offset secular volume declines and
lower exports sales; albeit with a fair degree of risk
because of weather-related future crop yield
uncertainty.
• Adjusted EBITDA margins expand by 50 basis
points (bps) to about 11% in fiscal 2020 reflecting
improved margin contribution from South America,
Africa and Asia along with increasing margins of
Other Tobacco Operations because of supply chain
efficiencies. The improvement in EBITDA margins
are partially offset by softness in the U.S. market due
to pricing pressure in response to tobacco
oversupply, declining domestic demand and lack of
export demand from China in wake of the ongoing
trade war between the U.S. and China. Adjusted
EBITDA margins remain in the 10% to 11% range
thereafter.
• Working capital remains only a modest use of cash
in our forecast allowing the company to generate
operating cash flows (OCF) of more than $130
million in fiscal year 2020 and beyond.
• Annual capital expenditures total $40 million to $45
million driven by maintenance, cost efficiency
projects, and customer-mandated spending to
update certain tobacco processing facilities. About
25% of those capital expenditures will be for
growth/non-maintenance investments.
• FOCF around $95 million in fiscal 2020 and above
$100 million thereafter during the forecast period.

• Annual dividends total at least $75 million annually.
• Annual discretionary cash flow (DCF) is near
break-even to a slight outflow after annual share
repurchases totaling about $20 million.
• Modest bolt-ons are not projected, but we anticipate
that any possible future acquisition would not lead
to debt to EBITDA above 2x on a sustained basis.

Company Description
Universal is a leaf tobacco merchant and processor with operations in more than 30 countries. It sources tobacco leaf
through a global network of farmers with whom it has developed long-tenured relationships, cures and treats the
tobacco, then sells it to tobacco manufacturers (mainly cigarette, but also cigar and other tobacco products). In
addition to the core leaf tobacco business, the company is also involved in other smaller-scale tobacco and
agribusiness opportunities. The company also has a subsidiary, AmeriNic Inc., which produces liquid nicotine for
electronic nicotine delivery systems.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
Our assessment of Universal's business risk profile reflects its strong market position and longstanding customer
relationships but also narrow business focus and high customer concentrationUniversal has significant local expertise
particularly in developing markets, which enables it to manage thousands of farmers with seed/fertilizer, agronomy,
and financial support and acts as a barrier to entry. The company also benefits from its long and established customer
relationships with the largest tobacco manufacturers in the world. We believe Universal has a history of consistent and
healthy profitability. Still, we believe the company has relatively high customer concentration, as its top five customers
represent more than 60% of total revenues. Moreover, the evolving scale of vertical integration at these major
customers enables them to compete with Universal for leaf tobacco purchases in a number of markets, thereby
somewhat diluting the company's competitive positioning.
We have also factored Universal's narrow business focus into our assessment. The company is concentrated in the
tobacco leaf industry, which we believe has, at best, flat growth prospects with a fair degree of regulatory risk,
particularly to its end customers. Recent regulatory developments include the FDA proposing a ban on menthols and
reduction in nicotine levels in combustibles, though we view the risk to Universal's business from these developments
as remote in the near to medium term.
Earnings volatility is an significant risk for the company despite good geographic diversity. Universal has a relatively
diverse asset footprint particularly in the key Brazilian, African, Philippines, and North American markets, with the
ability to shift production over time with incremental investment. Despite this broad diversification, we believe its
exposure to certain higher risk regions, such as the African continent, could lead to earnings volatility given the greater
economic and political uncertainties of conducting business in those regions. We are less concerned about currency
risk associated with operating in these geographies because we believe currency risk is partly mitigated by the fact that

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 25, 2019 6

Universal Corp.

international tobacco trade is generally conducted in and the company finances most of its tobacco operations in U.S.
dollars. Nevertheless, short-term fluctuations in profitability because of several factors, including frequent supply and
demand imbalances, could hamper sales and green leaf prices year over year.

Peer comparison
We compare Universal to Pyxus International Inc. (Pyxus), which is also a tobacco leaf supplier, but also to several of
its rated customers, which are combustible cigarette manufacturers such as Altria Group Inc. (Altria), British American
Tobacco PLC (BAT), and Imperial Brands PLC (Imperial). Universal has a larger scale and stronger profit margins
compared with Pyxus, whose small scale makes it more vulnerable to industry supply/demand imbalances and limits
its bargaining power. Universal has also been more disciplined with its investments and has consistently implemented
cost reduction initiatives resulting in the company sustaining superior EBITDA margins of about 11% compared with
Pyxus's average EBITDA margins of 7%-8%. Pyxus has relatively lower sourcing from emerging markets than
Universal, but Universal has a demonstrated history of effectively managing large number of farmer relationships along
with having a better and more comprehensive approach to managing geopolitical risks. The ratings on Pyxus are
further constrained by its aggressive financial policies, deteriorating credit ratios with leverage remaining above 10x,
and weak liquidity.
Universal's tobacco customers such as Altria, BAT, and Imperial are much larger in scale, have stronger market
positions and better brand equity, along with having significantly higher profitability- all of which support a stronger
competitive position for these companies. Nonetheless, Universal's strong credit metrics support the rating. Universal's
leverage is lower than that of other rated tobacco companies, reflecting its moderate financial policies and balanced
approach to M&A and shareholder returns. Several peers like BAT and Imperial have much higher leverage but our
ratings on BAT reflect our view that the company will deleverage to the mid-3x area over the next year, while Imperial
is focusing on asset disposals, which coupled with its prudent financial policy and strong cash flow generation should
help decrease leverage.
Universal continues to demonstrate its commitment to maintaining the investment-grade rating by keeping debt
balances low even as it explores opportunities for additional investments into adjacent agribusiness industries.
Therefore, we believe Universal's leverage and cash flow ratios will remain comparably better than those of our
selected peers, with leverage near or below 1.5x.

Financial Risk: Modest
Universal sustains fairly stable cash flows, has strong interest coverage, and conservatively funds shareholder returns,
despite high working capital financing requirements. The company maintained a fiscal year-end cash balance of more
than $200 million for consecutive years. Combined with its stable free cash flow generation of more than $100 million
annually, this will sufficiently cover any share repurchases, dividends, and potential future acquisitions, which we do
not expect to be large. Therefore, we forecast the company's modest debt leverage will remain stable with year-end
debt to EBITDA consistently near 1.5x or lower. Moreover, despite the company's large seasonal tobacco inventory
financing requirements that lead to high inter-period debt balances and additional working capital interest costs, the
company continues to cover its interest costs well, with strong EBITDA interest coverage more than 10x in our
base-case projections largely unchanged from current trailing-12-month levels. The company's efficient operations and
low, mainly maintenance capex further support its financial profile as there is sufficient processing capacity across the
tobacco industry. The company's minimal capex needs allow its highly seasonal working capital borrowings to be
consistently paid down by the end of the company's annual operating cycle.

Liquidity: Adequate
Our liquidity assessment of adequate reflects our forecast that sources of liquidity will exceed uses by about 1.4x over
the next year, and that net liquidity sources would remain positive even if EBITDA falls 15%. We don't believe the
company has the ability to absorb high-impact, low probability events such as long-term crop supply disruptions or an
industry-wide initiative for tobacco manufacturers to significantly increase insourcing tobacco supplies without
refinancing. We believe the company has sound banking relationships and satisfactory standing in credit markets. We
believe the company maintains a generally prudent financial risk management to maintain adequate liquidity.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

Universal is highly exposed to social factors because it relies heavily on leaf tobacco, which is primarily used to
manufacture traditional combustible cigarettes. Universal faces heightened social risk by virtue of its customer
profile. The company's primary end-product, leaf tobacco, is used principally in manufacturing traditional
combustible cigarettes, which have been widely associated with increased health risks. Although the company has
been facing volume pressures driven by declines in tobacco consumption as a result of increasing consumer health
awareness and ever-increasing regulatory oversight, Universal has been able to maintain stable profitability by
providing additional value-added services to its customers, including blending and physical testing of tobacco,
service cutting, and manufacturing reconstituted leaf tobacco. We believe the company will remain challenged by
the effects of the health and regulatory risks its customers face and believe this is a material social risk. However,
we believe Universal's longstanding relationships with its largest customers including Altria Group Inc., British
American Tobacco plc, China Tobacco International, Inc., Imperial Brands plc, Japan Tobacco Inc., and Philip
Morris International Inc. position it well to navigate through these industry challenges.
