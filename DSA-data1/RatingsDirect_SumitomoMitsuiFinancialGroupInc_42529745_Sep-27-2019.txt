Outlook: Positive

S&P Global Ratings' outlooks on Japan-based megabank Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (SMFG), its lead
bank Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. (SMBC), and the group's core banking subsidiaries are positive. The outlooks
reflect our view that there is at least a one-in-three chance in the next two years or so we will upgrade SMFG, the
nonoperating financial holding company of SMBC Group, and its core banking subsidiaries, all of which
incorporate our assessment of potential extraordinary government support. This could be the case if we raise our
long-term sovereign credit rating on Japan. We view SMBC Group's stand-alone credit profile (SACP) as stable,
while the outlook on our sovereign credit rating on Japan is positive.
We may revise down the outlooks to stable in the event that any of three cases hurt the group's creditworthiness,
in our view. First, if we change the outlook on our long-term sovereign rating on Japan to stable. Second, if rapid
growth in the group's risk-weighted assets drags down its risk-adjusted capital (RAC) ratio below 7% on a sustained
basis. And third, if an increase in foreign currency-denominated funding alters its funding structure.

Rationale
The ratings on SMFG and its core banking subsidiaries reflect our view that the group maintains a strong competitive
position in Japan's commercial banking and retail financial markets and that SMBC Group's revenue is well-diversified
by region and business line. Our RAC ratio for SMBC Group has been improving in recent years because the group has
taken measures to restructure group companies and reduce strategic shareholdings. These are part of its endeavors to
meet banking regulatory requirements for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) and to strengthen its
governance structure.
Conditions to generate earnings remain severe. Although the group continues to enjoy higher spreads on domestic
lending than other banks, any improvement is unlikely. Therefore, we assess the group SACP as 'a' (the group SACP
excludes the likelihood of receiving extraordinary government support in a time of need).
The group has a high likelihood of receiving extraordinary government support in times of need, in our opinion.
However, this does not provide any uplift to the ratings as long as our sovereign rating on Japan is 'A+'. We believe
the group's nonoperating holding company, SMFG, is also likely to receive extraordinary government support.
However, the long-term issuer credit rating on SMFG is one notch lower than those on its core operating banks,
reflecting structural subordination as a nonoperating holding company.

Anchor:'bbb+' for SMBC Group reflects rising overseas exposure and an economic risk score of '3'
Our bank criteria use our Banking Industry Country Assessment (BICRA) economic risk and industry risk scores to
determine a bank's anchor, the starting point in assigning an issuer credit rating. We assess SMBC Group's anchor as
'bbb+', which is equivalent to the anchor for a bank operating primarily in Japan.
Economic risk in Japan's banking sector is relatively low by global comparison. As a result, the economic risk score for
Japan is '2'. Japanese banks benefit from operating in a large and diversified economy with various competitive

Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc.

industries. In addition, debt held by corporations and individuals generally grows moderately, which leads to sound
financial profiles in the private sector. Meanwhile, core retail deposits constitute a large share of systemwide funding
needs.
These strengths offset certain structural weaknesses, such as Japan's aging society, low economic growth, and the
government's limited fiscal flexibility to stimulate the economy because of its debt level, which is one of the highest
among developed countries.
Conversely, we view the industry risk that Japanese banks face as relatively higher than that faced by peer countries in
the same BICRA group. Therefore, we set the industry risk score for Japan at '4' because of the fragmented market and
its low profitability. We believe that the current situation, in which banks are enduring ongoing low profitability, poses
a risk to the stability of Japan's banking system.
The combination of SMBC Group's weighted-average economic risk score of '3' and Japan's industry risk score of '4'
results in an anchor of 'bbb+' for the group. Our '3' economic risk score for the group reflects the group's expanding
exposure to overseas countries and regions we regard as having higher economic risk than Japan, as well as changes
in our economic risk scores for these countries and regions. The score also incorporates qualitative assessments of
factors such as its business strategies.

Business position: Strong in domestic commercial and retail banking
We assess SMBC Group's business position as strong. It maintains a strong competitive position in the domestic
commercial and retail banking markets. SMFG is a bank holding company that owns one of the largest banks in Japan,
with assets totaling ¥204 trillion as of the end of fiscal 2018 (ended March 31, 2019). The group's main operating bank,
SMBC, provides traditional commercial banking services using its nationwide network in Japan and its overseas
operations. Groupwide revenue is well-diversified by region and business line, including leasing, brokerage and
investment services, and credit card and consumer finance.
SMBC Group's expansion of its overseas operations in recent years has allowed it to establish a well-balanced business
portfolio, in our view. It consists of the retail and wholesale business units, which conduct business mainly in Japan,
the global markets business unit, and the international business unit. Profit from the international business unit made
up 33% of the group's total net operating profit in fiscal 2018. The group is likely to continue to strengthen its overseas
businesses, such as banking in Asia excluding Japan. Forming part of this foothold is the February 2019 merger of

Indonesian lender PT Bank Tabungan Pensiunan Nasional Tbk (BTPN) and PT Bank Sumitomo Mitsui Indonesia
(SMBC Indonesia).
SMBC Group does not have an extensive retail deposit base in major currency countries outside Japan. This may
pressure its ability to take on foreign currency funding stably when market conditions deteriorate. This contrasts with
its ample liquidity and abundant funding in the domestic currency. It also constrains further growth of its overseas
business. As a result, through flexible control of its overseas loan assets, the group aims to strengthen its revenue base
in areas that do not require material growth in foreign currency assets.
SMBC Group has stable customer bases in both retail and corporate banking in Japan. Domestic retail deposits are
stable. SMBC Group has strong main bank relationships with many corporate customers, and these customers have
maintained long-term relationships with the group. SMBC Group has established groupwide business units to further
support client needs. Specifically, it has integrated its management structure across the group's legal entities, including
SMBC and nonbank group companies.

Capital and earnings: Improved and stable RAC ratio indicates continued adequate capital
We expect SMBC Group to maintain adequate capital, with its improved RAC ratio remaining stable in the next two
years or so. We expect a group RAC ratio of 7.25%-7.75% in the next two years. The ratio was 8.3% as of the end of
September 2018, steadily improving from below 6% as of the end of March 2012. Our expected range takes into
account our view that the group is likely to shift its management focus slightly to shareholder returns and business
expansion. This is because the group has good prospects for meeting the target capital ratio set under the final rule of
Basel III regulatory requirements. As a result, we expect growth of risk-weighted assets, the denominator of the RAC
ratio, to slightly outpace that of its capital.
SMBC Group's RAC ratio is susceptible to volatility in unrealized gains on equity holdings. As of the end of September
2018, 9% of its risk-weighted assets was attributable to market-risk exposure. This includes exposure to equities and
fund-related holdings in its banking account, excluding the trading account. If a fall in stock prices lowers unrealized
gains, its risk-weighted assets would increase and weaken its RAC ratio. This is because we factor in unrealized gains
in such exposure. We estimate the RAC ratio would decline about 0.5 percentage point if the unrealized gains were to
be half of ¥1.9 trillion, which was the amount as of the end of September 2018, provided that other factors remain
unchanged.

SEPTEMBER 25, 2019 6

Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc.

We assess SMBC Group's capital quality as adequate. Its ratio of hybrid securities to total adjusted capital (TAC) was
about 12% as of the end of September 2018. We include its Additional Tier 1 hybrids in our TAC calculation because
we regard their equity content as intermediate given their coupon deferral and principal writedown features.
Conversely, we do not include SMBC Group's Basel III Tier 2 hybrids in our TAC calculation because we regard their
equity content as low. These hybrids with low equity content, which are eligible for inclusion in the calculation of
regulatory capital, accounted for about 16% of the group's TAC as of the end of September 2018.
We estimate SMBC Group's earnings buffer at 40 basis points (bps) to 60 bps over the next one to two years. We
consider this modest, reflecting our view of a continued decline in net interest margins, primarily in loans to domestic
small and midsize enterprise (SME) borrowers. We base our estimate on our assumption that the normalized loss rate
over its credit risk exposure would be 0.27% under our RAC framework. However, the group's actual credit costs have
remained low in recent years amid Japan's stable credit market.
We believe SMBC Group is likely to have stable revenue because of the group's limited reliance on highly volatile
business. Net interest income and fees and commissions made up 84% of the group's gross operating income in fiscal
2018. Trading revenue, which it earned mainly from trading gains on government bonds, made up a limited share of
less than 10%.
The group aims to improve its overhead ratio to about 60% in the medium to long term. To achieve this target, it is
improving productivity and efficiency through digitalization and reorganization of retail branches. The ratio was 60.3%
in fiscal 2018 after rising above 62% in fiscal 2016 from about 55% prior to that.

Risk position: Limited volatile businesses and stable asset quality
We expect SMBC Group's loan portfolio to grow moderately and its performance to remain stable. In our view, the
major risk to SMBC Group is credit risk related to commercial banking. Corporate exposure made up 77% of its

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 25, 2019 8

Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc.

credit-risk assets (as defined under our RAC framework) as of the end of September 2018, while retail exposure made
up 10%. The group's ratio of gross nonperforming loans (NPLs) remained low at 0.9%, and the ratio of its credit costs
to average loan balance was about 0.2% as of the end of fiscal 2018.
Credit costs may not fully capture higher credit risk because they generally reflect past loan performance. We regard
sharp fluctuations in exchange rates and a decline in Japan's GDP as potential risk factors for SMEs' credit quality. In
addition, one characteristic of Japan's banking industry is a main bank system, where banks and corporations value
long-term stable relationships. Thus, if the business performance of large borrowers with which SMBC Group has close
relationships deteriorates, the group may incur large losses or experience an increase in NPLs.
SMBC Group is focusing on overseas expansion, mainly in the lending business. The international business division
held about 38% of its groupwide regulatory risk-weighted assets as of the end of fiscal 2018. Overseas loans dominate
the distribution of assets with low probability of default under the group's internal rating scores. Therefore, the group's
overseas loan portfolio is unlikely to cause losses far exceeding the normalized loss rate under our RAC framework, in
our opinion.
We believe SMBC Group is exposed to market risk mainly from its cross-shareholdings and government bond
portfolio. In particular, its banking book has material exposure to interest rate risk that the RAC framework does not
cover. Nevertheless, SMBC Group's Japanese government bond holdings were about ¥6.2 trillion as of the end of fiscal
2018, a significant reduction from about ¥27 trillion as of the end of fiscal 2012. SMBC Group held about ¥9.0 trillion
in foreign bonds in the same period. We believe SMBC Group's interest risk is likely to remain manageable.
In our view, SMBC Group benefits from diversification of risk under our RAC framework. The adjusted RAC ratio,
reflecting increased risk from concentration or reduced risk from diversification, was 0.4 percentage point higher than
the nonadjusted ratio as of the end of September 2018.
SMBC Group's business complexity is average compared with that of major global financial groups. SMBC Group has
extensive operations in multiple countries and regions, making its business somewhat complex. However, the
investment banking business accounts for a limited portion of the group's overall earnings.

Funding and liquidity: Solid core deposit base and ample liquidity
In our view, SMBC Group has a large pool of domestic retail customers, which provides a stable base of core deposits
that it draws from for its funding needs. Accordingly, we believe SMBC Group's funding is above average and its
liquidity position is strong. Since Sept. 30, 2016, core customer deposits have consistently made up about 70% of its
funding base. At the same time, the group's stable funding ratio, as defined by S&P Global Ratings, has held steady
above 100% (involving some proxies for calculating the ratio), hovering in the range of 110%-120% since Sept. 30,
2016.
SMBC Group's ratio of total loans to customer deposits [(loans + lease receivables and lease assets - loan loss reserve)
/ (deposits excluding negotiable certificate of deposits)] was 64% as of the end of fiscal 2018, indicating strong
liquidity. Unrestricted cash and Japanese government bond holdings more than covered its short-term wholesale
funding, which also indicates strong liquidity.
We think foreign currency-denominated funding remains an important issue for the group, which has embarked on
measures to secure stable foreign currency funding. Its ability to secure foreign currency funding constrains further
growth in its overseas loan portfolio, in our view. SMBC Group is dependent on wholesale funding in foreign
currencies because it lacks an overseas retail deposit base. Overseas loans extended by SMBC and the group's major
overseas banking subsidiaries totaled $235 billion as of the end of fiscal 2018, up about 42% in the past five years,
excluding the effects of foreign exchange rates. In tandem with this, SMBC Group has secured stable foreign currency
funding by more than doubling its customer deposits, including central bank deposits, to ¥222 billion in the past five
years. It has also diversified its funding, issuing the first Japanese euro-denominated covered bonds in November
2018. It has also reduced reliance on short-term market funding in foreign currencies. Indeed, its outstanding balance
of foreign currency-denominated bonds, including total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) debt, totaled about $61.1
billion as of the end of March 2019.

Support: High systemic importance in Japan, but no notch-up
We consider SMBC Group highly likely to receive extraordinary government support in times of need. This reflects our
view of the group's high systemic importance in Japan and the government's highly supportive tendency toward
private-sector banks in Japan. We base our assessment on SMBC Group's large presence in the Japanese financial
system as one of three megabank groups, as well as laws stipulating potential support, and the government's record of
support for the banking sector.
Nevertheless, our issuer credit ratings on SMBC Group's core operating banks are on par with the group SACP even
after accounting for the likelihood of the group receiving extraordinary government support. This is because its "group
SACP is only one notch lower than the sovereign rating on Japan, which limits the degree of government support

factored into our issuer credit ratings.

Hybrid issue ratings
We rate SMFG-issued Basel III-compliant subordinated bonds as 'BBB+', two notches below the group SACP. The
notching reflects subordination risk and structural subordination because the bonds are issued by the nonoperating
holding company. We did not deduct any additional notch for loss absorption upon the occurrence of a nonviability
event. This is because:
• We believe the government would likely provide extraordinary, preemptive support to systemically important banks
at a relatively early stage if they were to suffer financial distress; and
• Preemptive government support through a capital injection would not constitute a nonviability event and, therefore,
would not lead to a writedown of principal or equity conversion of the hybrid.
We rate preferred securities issued by SMFG's special-purpose corporations--Basel II-compliant preferred securities
included in the Tier 1 capital ratio--as 'BBB-', four notches lower than the group SACP. The notching from the group
SACP reflects subordination risk, partial or untimely payment risk on the dividends as Tier 1 capital, and structural
subordination because the securities are linked to the nonoperating holding company.
