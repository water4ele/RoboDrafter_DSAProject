Overview
Key Strengths

Key Risks

Largest provider of post-acute care services in the U.S., with
operations in 47 states and the District of Columbia (D.C.).

Exposure to reimbursement risk.

Sizeable scale, with four business segments across the U.S. and
revenue exceeding $5 billion.

Highly acquisitive to drive growth, which we believe will keep leverage
around 5x.

Good cash flow, as we anticipate about $180 million in discretionary
cash flow in 2019.

Partners' put options for Concentra exercisable beginning in February
2020 would require significant use of cash for three years.
Operates in a highly fragmented and competitive industry.

We view reimbursement rates as a key long-term risk. We believe the persistent focus on health-care cost containment
will result in ongoing reimbursement rate pressure, which we view as a key risk to Select Medical's credit profile. Flat
or small reimbursement rate increases will pressure EBITDA margins, as we anticipate operating costs will rise at a
faster rate. However, Select has diversified its business mix and lowered its reliance on government payers, which we
view as the most vulnerable to reimbursement-rate pressure. Medicare currently accounts for about 27% of Select's
revenue, down from 45% five years ago.
The Medicare long-term acute-care (LTAC) criteria change limits revenue growth for Select Medical's largest segment.
Select Medical adjusted its LTAC strategy to accept only compliant patients, which limits volume and revenue growth
by excluding site-neutral patients but raises revenue per patient day and, thereby, its margins. Based on this strategy,
the company's patient compliance rate was close to 100% as of second-quarter 2019.
The LTAC criteria require Medicare patients to spend three days in an intensive-care unit or four days on a ventilator
to be considered post-intensive care or compliant for the provider to be eligible for a full LTAC payment. Phase I of the
LTAC criteria began in September 2016, and noncompliant or site-neutral patients were reimbursed at a blended rate
of the full LTAC rate and the site-neutral rate. Beginning in September 2019, Select's LTACs will begin receiving the
site-neutral rate for noncompliant patients.

Third-party put options will likely require material use of cash. We anticipate the company using about $300 million
each year for the next three years to acquire the remaining ownership of Concentra. Welsh, Carson, Anderson and
Stowe and Dignity Health own 49.9% of Concentra, and have put options requiring Select to purchase one-third of
their ownership positions in Concentra each year for the next three years beginning in February 2020. We expect
Welsh, Carson, and Dignity to exercise their options.
We expect leverage to remain around 4.5x-5.0x. We expect Select's adjusted debt leverage to remain around 4.5x-5.0x
over the next two years as the company pursues additional acquisitions. Select has supplemented organic growth with
several sizeable acquisitions in recent years. We believe the company will pursue additional acquisitions, likely
requiring additional debt financing that would increase leverage.
Modest near-term sales growth. We expect modest overall near-term sales growth, as solid growth in Select's Inpatient
Rehabilitation Facilities (IRFs) is balanced by limited sales growth in its other three segments (LTAC, outpatient
rehabilitation, and Concentra). Growth in these segments is limited by minimal reimbursement rate increases and by
Select's LTAC strategy. However, we believe cost controls will contribute to improving EBITDA margins.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our expectations for Select to generate stable-to-improving EBITDA margins and good
discretionary cash flow of about $180 million-$200 million each year over the next two years and adjusted
debt-to-EBITDA leverage of 4.5x-5.0x.

Downside scenario
We could lower our rating if weaker-than-expected patient volume, additional reimbursement cuts, or increased
operating costs result in deteriorating EBITDA margins, increase in leverage, and decline in discretionary cash
flow. We would then expect an EBITDA-margin contraction of about 150 basis points (bps) or more and a sizeable
decline in free cash flow, leading to leverage above 5.5x with limited prospects for improvement.

Upside scenario
Although we do not expect to raise the rating over the next year, we could do so if we gained confidence that
Select Medical was committed to a reduced debt leverage profile below 4x sustainably. Such a scenario would
require EBITDA-margin expansion well above our base-case forecast.

Assumptions

Key Metrics

Our base case assumes:

Based on these assumptions, we arrive at the following
credit measures:

• Sales growth in the low single digits over the next
two years, driven by mid- to high-single-digit IRF
growth, partially offset by low-single-digit growth in
LTAC, outpatient rehabilitation, and Concentra
segments.
• Adjusted EBITDA improvement of 40 bps on slightly
better IRF margins, and improved same-hospital
revenue per (LTAC) patient day based on a 100%
patient-compliant rate.

• Adjusted debt to EBITDA of about 5.1x in 2019,
declining to 4.8x in 2020 and funds from operations
(FFO) to debt of about 12%-14% over the next two
years.
• FFO to debt of about 11%-13% over the next two
years; and
• Discretionary cash flow of about $180 million-$200
million annually over the next two years.

Company Description
Select Medical Corp. is the largest post-acute-care provider in the U.S., with operations in 47 states and D.C. Select
operates four businesses: Critical Illness Recovery Hospitals (formerly LTAC Hospitals), IRF, Outpatient Rehabilitation
Clinics, and Occupational Medicine Centers. The company is the largest operator of Critical Illness Recovery
Hospitals, with 100 hospitals in 28 states; the second-largest operator of IRFs with 28 hospitals in 12 states; the largest
operator of Outpatient Rehabilitation Clinics with 1,695 clinics in 37 states and D.C.; and the largest operator of
Occupational Medicine Centers with 526 centers in 41 states, through its 51%- owned Concentra subsidiary.
Concentra also provides veterans' health-care services, along with primary care and mental health community-based
outpatient clinics.

Business Risk: Weak
Our assessment of Select's business risk as weak reflects reimbursement risk, characterized by the potential for rate
cuts, low rate increases, and possible regulatory changes that can hurt reimbursement. We also view the industry as
fragmented and competitive, with limited barriers to entry. Partially offsetting these factors is the company's good
scale (about $5 billion of revenues), good geographic diversification (across 47 states and D.C.), and leading market
shares in each of its four businesses, where Select has either the largest or second- largest market share. However,
Medicare reimbursement, which we view as most vulnerable to risk, has declined from 45% of sales in 2014 to 27% of
sales as of the second quarter of 2019, primarily due to the significant expansion of Concentra, the payer mix of which
is primarily commercial payers and workers' compensation.
Select's largest segment--Critical Illness Recovery Hospitals--is facing ongoing operating pressures, including wage
inflation, partly stemming from a shortage of specialized nurse practitioners required for the treatment of higher-acuity
patients. Further, we believe reimbursement pressures are very significant for many LTAC providers. Although Select

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

AUGUST 16, 2019 4

Select Medical Corp.

is at about 100% patient compliance, we expect competition for patient referrals to intensify, particularly as the
blended reimbursement rate for site-neutral patients rolls off in September 2019. Select has increased its educational
and referral efforts and partnerships at acute-care hospitals in an effort to maintain steady access to high-acuity
patients.
The 51% ownership of Concentra, which acquired U.S. HealthWorks in 2018, bolsters the company's competitive
position as the largest U.S. provider of outpatient rehab services and diversifies its Critical Illness Recovery Hospital
business. These outpatient businesses also improve Select's overall payer mix profile, as Physiotherapy and Concentra
predominantly generate revenues from commercial insurers and state workers' compensation programs.

Peer comparison
We compare Select to other post-acute-care providers, including Encompass Healthcare, and for-profit healthcare
systems such as HCA Healthcare and Tenet Healthcare. Select is the largest of its post-acute-care peers and has an
attractive competitive position through its leading market share in this highly fragmented industry.
Encompass Healthcare (BB-/Stable/--), an operator of rehabilitation facilities, has lower leverage of about 3x and has
higher EBITDA margins than Select due to a greater mix of higher-margin inpatient rehabilitation hospitals. HCA
Healthcare (BB+/Stable/--) is one of the largest health care service companies in the U.S. It operates 184 hospitals
and approximately 2,000 sites of care, including surgery centers, free-standing emergency rooms, urgent-care centers,
and physician clinics in 21 states and the U.K. HCA has lower leverage at about 3.9x and has higher EBITDA margins
and generates significantly greater discretionary cash flow (over $900 million) than Select. Tenet Healthcare
(B/Positive/--), which is one of the largest health-care-service companies in the U.S., generates significantly higher
revenue than Select but has lower EBITDA margins and a higher leverage of 7x.-8x.

Financial Risk: Aggressive
We expect Select's adjusted debt leverage to generally remain at 4.5x-5.0x over the next two years and for FFO to
debt to remain at 11%-13% for the same period. Although debt leverage is currently stretched for the rating category,
we believe the company has the ability to de-leverage over the outlook period through EBITDA expansion. This
confidence is supported by the company's demonstrated success in margin expansion of acquired entities, as well as in
navigating the adverse reimbursement environment in its LTAC business and preserving its EBITDA margin in this
segment. Moreover, we believe the company's good discretionary cash flow generation of about $180 million expected
in 2019 is a key credit factor supporting the 'B+' rating. However, we expect the company to use much of that free
cash flow to fund the purchase of the remaining stake in Concentra that Select does not currently own in each of the
next three years, starting in 2020.

Adjusted ratios

Liquidity: Adequate
We assess Select's liquidity as adequate. Sources of cash are likely to exceed uses of cash by more than 1.2x over the
next 12 months. We believe the company does not have the ability to withstand a high-impact, low-probability event,
like a significant cut in Medicare reimbursement rates across its segments, without refinancing. Furthermore, we
believe the company has satisfactory standing in the credit market, sound relationships with its banks, and generally
prudent risk management.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• About $124 million in cash on hand as of June 30,
2019;

• Mandatory debt amortization of about $12 million
annually;

• $450 million availability under the revolving credit
facility; and

• Capital expenditures of about $172 million over the
next 12 months; and

• Cash FFO of about $377 million over the next 12
months.

• Working-capital usage of about $26 million over the
next 12 months.

Debt maturities
The below debt maturities account for the expected redemption on Aug. 30, 2019, of $710 million of senior notes due
in 2021. Following its debt financing in August 2019, Select deposited sufficient funds to redeem all of the outstanding
senior notes due 2021 on Aug. 30, 2019.
• $450 million revolving credit facility due 2024;
• $1.65 billion of senior secured term loans due 2025;
• $550 million of senior unsecured notes due 2026;
• $1.1 billion in Concentra first-lien term loans; and
• $240 million in Concentra second-lien term loans.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

Environmental and social issues are relevant to our analysis but do not currently present a significant driver to the
rating. We consider Select's key environmental, social, and governance risk to be health care cost-containment
pressure, which could include unfavorable reimbursement changes. However, we view post-acute-care and
outpatient providers as offering a less costly service than in-patient, acute-care facilities. We also view outpatient
services as an attractive alternative, as they are typically more convenient for patients. These factors are included
in our analysis and assessment of the company's business risk profile.

Issue Ratings - Recovery Analysis
Key analytical factors
• Select Medical Corp.'s capital structure consists of a $1.65 billion senior secured term loan due in 2025, $550 million
in unsecured notes due in 2026, and a $450 million revolving credit facility due 2024.
• Our simulated default scenario contemplates a default in 2023, stemming from a significant decline in
reimbursement rates and a reduction in allowed visits due to economic deterioration.
• Given the company's market-leading position in many of its services and in the geographic regions in which it
operates, as well as the continued demand for its services, we believe Select would remain a viable business and
would reorganize rather than liquidate in case of payment default.
• Consequently, we have used an enterprise value methodology to gauge recovery prospects. We valued the
company as a going concern, using a 5.5x multiple off our projected EBITDA at default, which is consistent with the
multiple used for similar companies.

Simulated default assumptions
• Simulated year of default: 2023
• Implied enterprise value multiple: 5.5x
