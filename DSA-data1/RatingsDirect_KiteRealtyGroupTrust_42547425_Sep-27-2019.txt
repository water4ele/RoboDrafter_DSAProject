Kite’s portfolio quality has been steadily increasing through the
disposition of noncore assets, with improving rents, trade area
statistics, and same-property NOI percentage growth rates.

One of our smaller rated strip-center REITs with some concentration in
Florida at 25% of annualized base rent (ABR).

Credit protection measures are expected to improve materially in
2019, with asset sale proceeds largely used to pay down some
outstanding debt.

Continued retail distress and changing consumer/tenant demands could
require additional capex to repurpose certain assets, including power
center assets.

Manageable redevelopment and development pipeline, especially
compared to similarly sized rated peers which have increased
pipelines in recent years.

Some exposure to troubled retailers and those under e-commerce
pressure, which could negatively affect rents and occupancy should store
closures and bankruptcies be greater than anticipated.

Kite's relatively small but well occupied portfolio of shopping centers ($3.4 billion in undepreciated assets as of June 30,
2019) should support fairly stable cash flow generation. We believe the company's focus on grocery and needs-based
retailers--approximately 71% of is from centers with a grocery component--should provide some protection against
continued retail distress, as we think grocery stores help drive regular foot traffic to centers. Moreover, the impact of
e-commerce on grocery has proven less material than with other retail categories such as apparel thus far. That being
said, Kite has exposure to some retailers facing continued e-commerce pressure which could negatively affect
operating metrics over the next few years.
Kite's portfolio quality has improved modestly following the completion of its asset disposition program. Earlier this
year, Kite announced plans to sell up to $500 million of noncore assets with weaker demographic profiles to focus
operations within select top 50 U.S. markets. At the start of the program, the disposition pool consisted of properties
with lower three-mile average population, average household income, and ABR per square foot versus the remaining
portfolio. The properties also had a smaller amount of ABR with a grocer component and within the top 50 markets.
Year-to-date through June 30, 2019, Kite sold 8 noncore assets for $244 million. Subsequent to the quarter end, it sold
an additional five noncore assets for $157 million, bringing the total to $415 million. As a result, ABR/sf has steadily
increased, reaching $17.35 as of June 30, 2019 (and $17.42 pro forma for asset sales after the second quarter), up from
$16.66 a year prior. Following the completion of asset sales, Kite expects approximately 62% of its NOI will be from 15
to 20 focus markets that meet certain data-driven criteria, such as good prospects for job growth and population
migration. We expect Kite to complete dispositions by year-end, with continued modest asset recycling in future years
to further enhance its position within its target markets. (Kite's long-term goal is to have at least 80% of its NOI

generated from these markets.)

We expect credit protection measures to improve as the company uses proceeds from asset sales for debt repayment.
Kite fortified its balance sheet in 2019 by paying down some debt, with S&P Global Ratings' adjusted debt-to-EBITDA
of 6.0x for the last-12-months (LTM) period ended June 30, 2019 (compared to 6.3x a year prior). We expect further
improvement, with $157 million in sales completed subsequent to the second quarter and approximately $75 million in
additional dispositions expected for the remainder of the year, such that debt to EBITDA declines below 6x by
year-end.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on Kite reflects S&P Global Ratings' expectation for the company to complete its disposition
program in 2019, and use proceeds to pay down some outstanding debt. We project adjusted debt to EBITDA to
decline to and remain below 6x over the next two years, with fixed-charge coverage (FCC) in the 3x area.
Furthermore, we expect operating performance to remain healthy, with rent continuing to increase, supported by
positive re-leasing spreads and occupancy in the low- to mid-90% area. We expect Kite to execute on its modest
redevelopment pipeline with minimal acquisition activity over the next two years.

Upside scenario
While unlikely over the next 12 to 24 months, we would consider an upgrade if Kite achieves greater scale in target
markets while executing on its current and future redevelopment pipeline. Moreover, we would also need to see
the company consistently post operating results that are at least in line with those of higher-rated peers in terms of
same-store NOI growth and rents within similar markets. Considering the company's smaller asset base, upward
momentum would be contingent on Kite maintaining debt to EBITDA below 6x, with FCC remaining above 3x.

Downside scenario
While also unlikely over the near term, we would consider a downgrade if Kite's operating performance
deteriorates significantly, perhaps from additional retail distress and tenant vacancies, such that same-property
NOI growth turns negative and compares unfavorably to peers. In addition, we could lower the rating should Kite
engage in debt-funded acquisitions or development such that FCC falls below 2.1x or debt to EBITDA rises above
7.5x for a sustained period.

Assumptions

• U.S. real GDP growth of 2.5% in 2019 and 1.8% in
2020, with unemployment remaining in the mid– to
high-3% area, which should support steady real
estate demand.
• Strip center REITs remain more insulated from retail
distress than malls, given less exposure to
department stores and a larger focus on
e-commerce resistant/adaptable tenants (grocers
and service-oriented retailers).

supported by occupancy in the low- to mid-90%
area and positive re-leasing spreads.
• Minimal acquisitions over the next two years.
• Development and redevelopment spend of less than
$60 million per year over the next two years.
• Asset dispositions of approximately $500 million in
2019 ($415 million completed as of Aug. 5, 2019)
followed by $50 million to $100 million in future
years.
• Annual dividends of approximately $100 million to
$115 million per year.

Base-case projections
We expect Kite to achieve positive same-property NOI growth with occupancy in the 90% area over the next two years.
Kite has a manageable lease expiration schedule, which should keep the company's cash flow fairly stable, absent
greater-than-expected retail bankruptcies or distress.
We expect Kite to be a net seller of assets in 2019.
We believe Kite will use the majority of proceeds for debt repayment, resulting in debt to EBITDA declining to and
remaining in the mid- to high-5x area over the next two years.

Company Description
Kite Realty Group Trust is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns and operates high-quality neighborhood and
community shopping centers. As of June 30, 2019, the company held an economic interest in 103 operating and
redevelopment properties throughout 18 states, totaling approximately 19.9 million square feet, and one development
project currently under construction.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
Kite's asset and market quality has shown modest improvement with the elimination of some underperforming assets
with inferior trade area statistics through Project Focus, a portfolio transformation program through which Kite has
closed on $415 million in asset sales year-to-date through Aug. 5, 2019. These dispositions, combined with rental rate
increases and less retail fallout thus far in 2019, have resulted in some operating performance improvement, with
same-property NOI growth of 1.8% and 1.7% in the first and second quarters of 2019, respectively (compared to 1.5%
in each of the same quarters in 2018). Moreover, retail leased occupancy improved to 95.1% at June 30, 2019 (up from
93.8% a year prior), though economic occupancy declined slightly (92.4% at June 30, 2019, versus 93.0% a year prior)
due to anchor leasing activity.
Chart 3

The company's tenant base is well-diversified, with the 10 largest tenants accounting for just 18.4% of its annualized
base rent as of June 30, 2019 (17.8% pro forma for asset dispositions subsequent to second quarter). Publix Super
Markets Inc. (unrated) contributes the most ABR at 2.8% (2.7% pro forma) followed by the TJX Cos. Inc.
(A+/Stable/--) at 2.1% and Bed, Bath, and Beyond (BB+/Negative/--) at 2.0%. In our opinion, Kite's focus on
customer-facing properties (57.8% of ABR is from the service, entertainment, grocery, and restaurant industries)
should prove beneficial, as these industries have fared better than traditional retailers amid heightened e-commerce
risk. However, the company has some geographic concentration in Florida at 25% of ABR as of June 30, 2019.
Kite's portfolio is somewhat diversified by retail property class, with 57% exposure to community centers, followed by

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 26, 2019 7

Kite Realty Group Trust

25% exposure to neighborhood and lifestyle centers. However, it still has some exposure to power centers (18%),
which could prove disadvantageous, as they are generally larger and could require more capital spending to re-lease
should the spaces become vacant. That said, Kite's development and redevelopment pipeline is manageable, with just
one project under construction and three projects in the shadow pipeline as of June 30, 2019. We expect Kite to invest
approximately $35 million per year on redevelopment activities to "de-box" certain centers, with limited future
acquisitions on the horizon within target markets given current pricing.
Chart 4

Peer comparison
Kite is the second-smallest peer out of its selected peer group, behind ROIC. The company's operating performance
continues to improve, although rent remains below the peer group average. We view Kite's market quality as similar to
that of Weingarten and RPAI while modestly weaker than West Coast-focused ROIC. While peers are similar from a
credit profile perspective, Weingarten and RPAI currently operate with lower leverage while ROIC operates with
higher leverage. However, we expect Kite will be more in-line with Weingarten and RPAI over the next year, with debt
to EBITDA declining below 6x.

Financial Risk: Intermediate
Kite's credit protection measures improved in 2018, with debt to EBITDA of 6.3 at year-end, compared to 6.8 at
year-end 2017. We expect further improvement in 2019, with proceeds from asset sales used to deleverage the balance
sheet such that debt to EBITDA declines to the mid- to high-5x area, with FCC improving to the mid-3x area and debt
to undepreciated capital declining below 40%. Given the company's recently revised financial policy, we expect credit
protection measures to remain near these levels over the next two years. We anticipate any future development or
acquisition activity to be funded in a largely leverage-neutral manner.
Kite has actively repaid debt over the past year, with zero debt maturing through 2020 and no more than 20% of the
company's debt scheduled to mature in any single calendar year. As of June 30, 2019, the debt portfolio had a
weighted average maturity of 5.7 years and a weighted average interest rate of 4.16%.

Liquidity: Strong
We view Kite's liquidity as strong, reflecting our expectation that liquidity sources will exceed uses by 1.5x over the
next 12 months and 1.0x over the subsequent 12 months. We also project positive sources to uses, even if forecasted
EBITDA declines by 15%, supported by cash on hand, availability under the company's revolving credit facility, and
positive cash funds from operations (FFO) generation. Kite has ample availability under its unsecured credit facility
due April 22, 2022 (with two 6-month extension options), which further enhances the company's liquidity profile.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
For investment-grade real estate companies, we typically rate the senior unsecured debt the same as the issuer credit
rating, unless the percentage of secured debt exceeds 35% of total undepreciated real estate assets (or 40% of the fair
market value of assets).

Analytical conclusions
As of June 30, 2019, the ratio of secured debt to undepreciated assets was 15.3%, below the threshold of 35%.
Therefore, we rate the unsecured debt 'BBB-', the same as the issuer credit rating.
