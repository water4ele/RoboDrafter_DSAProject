Overview
Key Strengths

Key Risks

Prospects for continued solid market position as
Japan's largest diversified real estate company.

High earnings volatility in its property sales business in nature, although the company will
likely secure solid earnings in the near future, given its strong sales capabilities backed by
properties that are differentiated in terms of location and specifications.

An enhanced leasing property portfolio in terms of
quality, value, and diversification.

Prospects for slightly weak measures of cash flow for the rating.

Strong management and development capabilities
and a record of delivering large, high-value-added
projects.

A likely gradual increase in debt ratios as the company continues aggressive investments
in Japan and overseas.

A management business with an increasing volume
of assets that contributes to the stability of its
EBITDA and cash flow.
Relatively stable financial position with prospects for
maintaining a favorable interest coverage ratio.

We expect Mitsui Fudosan's overall earnings to expand moderately, backed by enhanced leasing portfolio. In our view,
favorable real estate environment is likely to underpin Japan-based diversified real estate company Mitsui Fudosan Co.
Ltd.'s solid business performance over the next year or two. In the domestic real estate leasing market, vacancy rates
have declined nationwide and rent levels have continued to improve moderately. Furthermore, the company has been
raising the quality, value, and diversification of its leasing property portfolio by adding new properties, rebuilding
existing properties, and enhancing various property types, including retail and logistics facilities. Also, its management
business is handling more assets. We believe these factors are likely to support moderate growth and stability of the
company's overall sales and EBITDA.
Mitsui Fudosan will likely reduce earnings volatility risk in its property sales and overseas businesses.We view
property sales as exposed to revenue volatility because demand is highly susceptible to changes in economic cycle,
regulations, and taxation. In the domestic market, however, Mitsui Fudosan's strong real estate development and sales
capabilities partially offset such risks, leading us to believe the company continues to secure good earnings by
supplying high-quality properties that are differentiated in terms of location and property specifications. Mitsui
Fudosan's overseas operations, which the company aims to strengthen, also face various potential risks, such as those
related to interest rates, foreign exchange, legal and constitutional changes, taxation and business practices, as well as

SEPTEMBER 11, 2019 2

Mitsui Fudosan Co. Ltd.

real estate market volatility of the investing countries. We also think Mitsui Fudosan is likely to manage earnings
volatility risk appropriately in its overseas development businesses in Europe, the U.S., and Asia (mainly China). We
believe the company can do this through collaborations with overseas partners and management of equity ownership
ratios, backed by its strengths in development of a variety of asset types.
We expect Mitsui Fudosan's debt ratios to gradually increase and its cash flow ratios to remain slightly weak for the
current rating. The company has accelerated growth investments in Japan and overseas as it pursues a 2025 goal of
booking about ¥350 billion in consolidated operating profit, with about 30% coming from overseas operations. Given
this, we expect spending to precede revenue growth and therefore expect the company's debt will increase further.
Debt ratios are likely to remain high and its ratio of funds from operations (FFO) to debt stay slightly weak for the
rating. However, we think FFO to debt is likely to deteriorate only marginally, because of stable cash flow from the
leasing business. Also, the company's favorable EBITDA interest coverage ratio will continue to offset the weakness of
high debt ratios.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on Mitsui Fudosan reflects our view that the company will maintain a strong market position
and generate moderately increased earnings from its enhanced leasing portfolio. We believe its leasing business,
together with its stable management business, will likely offset volatility risk in its development business. We also
expect financial ratios related to cash flow for Mitsui Fudosan to remain slightly weak for the rating, in part
because of ongoing active investment in its leasing business.

Downside scenario
We will consider lowering the rating if the emergence of the following factors becomes more likely:
• EBITDA from its stable leasing and management businesses materially decreases because of deterioration in the
quality, size, and diversification of its leasing property portfolio, without a quick recovery in sight;
• The market for office buildings deteriorates markedly, significantly reducing the profitability of its leasing
business;
• A substantial portion of its EBITDA arises from businesses other than leasing for a prolonged period; or
• Its ratio of FFO to debt remains below 9% due to further aggressive investments in Japan and elsewhere.

Upside scenario
We will consider raising the rating if the company maintains a sound level of EBITDA interest coverage, while
sustainably improving its FFO-to-debt ratio to about 15%. The company would also have to greatly improve its
EBITDA margin by significantly increasing earnings from its leasing business, while controlling overseas business
risk.

• Higher growth in operating revenue than GDP in the
next one to two years, backed by a solid domestic
real estate leasing market.
• Continued moderate growth in operating revenues
and income for its leasing business, due mainly to a
moderate increase in rental income from existing

All years are fiscal, ending March 31 of the following

• Slower growth in revenue from property sales,
because of higher land acquisition costs and the
company's very selective investment process, with
profitability underpinned by solid capital gains on
property sales to investors.
• Continued high debt ratios as a result of aggressive
annual investments of about ¥400 billion in the next
few years.
• Annual shareholder returns of ¥45 billion-¥60 billion
(cash dividends and stock buybacks).

Base-case projections
Mitsui Fudosan's EBITDA margin will remain stable due to moderate increases in sales and EBITDA. Solid
performances for Mitsui Fudosan's property leasing and management businesses will support moderate growth in its
overall sales and EBITDA. Profitability of its property leasing business will remain firm, because of a moderate
increase in rental income, slightly offset by cost of opening new buildings. In its property sales business, capital gains
on sales of properties to investors will underpin overall profitability of the business. As a result, its EBITDA margin will
hover at 22%-23%.
Mitsui Fudosan's cash flow ratios will remain slightly weak and its debt ratios will increase moderately. The company's
debt ratios will increase gradually, owing to aggressive investments in Japan and overseas. Its ratio of FFO to debt will
somewhat weaken and remain slightly above 9%.

Company Description
Mitsui Fudosan is Japan's largest diversified real estate company. It has leading positions in a diverse range of

Mitsui Fudosan Co. Ltd.

property businesses. Its major business segments are leasing, property sales, and management (which consist of
property management, brokering, and asset management). As of June 30, 2019, the company leased 5.329 million sq.
meters of office and retail space (owning about 67% and leasing the rest from third parties for sublease), with an
overall vacancy rate of 1.9% for office buildings and retail facilities (on a consolidated basis). In its residential property
sales business, Mitsui Fudosan sold 475 detached houses and 3,283 condominiums in fiscal 2018, mainly in the Tokyo
metropolitan area. Despite the company's international expansion efforts, slightly less than 90% of its tangible fixed
assets are still located in Japan.

To the extent that regulatory authorities allow a rating agency to acknowledge in one jurisdiction a rating issued in another jurisdiction for certain regulatory purposes, S&P
reserves the right to assign, withdraw or suspend such acknowledgment at any time and in its sole discretion. S&P Parties disclaim any duty whatsoever arising out of the
assignment, withdrawal or suspension of an acknowledgment as well as any liability for any damage alleged to have been suffered on account thereof.
S&P keeps certain activities of its business units separate from each other in order to preserve the independence and objectivity of their respective activities. As a result,
certain business units of S&P may have information that is not available to other S&P business units. S&P has established policies and procedures to maintain the
confidentiality of certain non-public information received in connection with each analytical process.
S&P may receive compensation for its ratings and certain analyses, normally from issuers or underwriters of securities or from obligors. S&P reserves the right to disseminate
its opinions and analyses. S&P's public ratings and analyses are made available on its Web sites, www.standardandpoors.com (free of charge), and www.ratingsdirect.com
(subscription), and may be distributed through other means, including via S&P publications and third-party redistributors. Additional information about our ratings fees is
