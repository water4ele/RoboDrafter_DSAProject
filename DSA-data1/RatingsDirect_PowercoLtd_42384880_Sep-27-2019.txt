Natural monopoly provider of electricity and gas distribution networks in
New Zealand

High capital expenditure over next three to four years under CPP

Strong regulatory regime with predictable and stable cash flow

Cash flow remain sensitive to weighted average cost of capital; FFO
to debt to reduce to 7.5%-8% after April 2020 reset

Simple operations and reduction in volume risk due to revenue cap under
the customized price path (CPP) for the electricity segment

Powerco Ltd. will continue to benefit from regulated cash flow under the customized price path (CPP) until 2023. The
company's capital and operating spending remain in line with the CPP. We will continue to monitor the company's
performance under its reliability and availability parameters, which are required to improve every year under the CPP.
Reduction in weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) to take effect from next financial year. In line with the final
default pricing path (DPP), the WACC for Powerco will be reset commencing April 2020. Consequently, there will be a
significant step-down of the WACC for the rest of the current regulatory period (till March 2023). As per the draft DPP
released in June 2019, the WACC was estimated at 5.13%, compared with the current WACC of 7.19% for the first two
years (fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020) of the CPP. The final WACC is likely to be lower by about 50-60 basis points (bps),
and we expect the company to moderate its dividends so as to maintain the metrics above the 7% downside trigger.
Despite reduced cash flow, the company's funds from operations (FFO) to debt would be around 7.5%-8%, with some
buffer above our downside trigger. Supporting the ratio will be a reduction in borrowing costs given the low interest
rate environment. Furthermore, the company retains the flexibility of moderating dividends should it need to.

Outlook: Stable

The stable rating outlook on Powerco Ltd. reflects the strength of the company's stable network businesses and
earnings visibility over the next three to four years under the CPP outcome. Further, we believe that Powerco
would operate within the allowances set under the regulatory outcome and manage its capital structure, subject to
the final WACC outcome, consistent with the current ratings.

Downside scenario
The likely buffer in the financial metrics and Powerco's flexible approach to dividends reduce the risk of rating
downside.
However, we believe downward rating pressure could occur if debt funding of capital expenditure or dividends
were to be aggressive, signaling a higher risk appetite. An FFO-to-debt ratio falling to below 7% would signal
negative rating pressure.

Upside scenario
We believe rating upside is of low probability over the next two to three years, given Powerco's policy of operating
at the current rating and that it is in the early stages of its CPP phase. However, we may raise the rating if we
believe the company will continue to operate with an FFO-to-debt ratio closer to 9%.

S&P Global Ratings Base-Case Scenario
Assumptions
• New Zealand's GDP to grow at 2.7% and inflation of 1.8% over the next two to three years. However, the electricity
and gas demand trends are not linearly correlated with economic factors, although periods of weak economic
growth could have a lagged impact.
• Regulated electricity revenue in line with the approved CPP and incorporating a reduced WACC from April 2020;
• Gas network tariffs as per the final reset parameters since October 2017;
• Slow growth in gas volumes and customer numbers compared with previous years;
• Operating expenses to remain within the electricity CPP and gas default price path (DPP), leading to an EBITDA
margin of 63%-66% (net of transmission costs) over the next couple of years;
• Capital expenditure of NZ$190 million-NZ$220 million per year (excluding customer contributions) for the next two
to three years, which are within the regulatory allowances.
• Stable dividends over the next couple of years; and
• Average interest rates to reduce to around 4% after completing the current regulatory hedging cycle.

Company Description
Powerco is New Zealand's second-largest regulated electricity and gas distributor. The company has a defined
franchise area in the North Island and services about 450,000 customers. About 87% of revenue comes from its
dominant electricity network business, 13% from its gas network.
Powerco's ultimate shareholders are funds owned/managed by QIC (58%), AMP Capital (15%), and by PINZ Holding
Co. (27%).

Business Risk: Excellent
Powerco's monopoly profile and certainty in profitability arising from New Zealand's strong regulatory framework
underpin its business risk profile.
The regulatory framework is mature and predictable, as well as stable, supportive, and transparent. The building-block
approach provides stability and visibility to utilities' revenues and EBITDA margins for about five years under each
regulatory period, supporting financial stability. Electricity revenues are set until March 2023 and gas pricing until
October 2022.
Powerco continues to operate under the CPP, which has enabled it to meet the significantly higher capital investment
required on its electricity network. The company could revert to a DPP after completion of its large capital works.
Furthermore, operating under a revenue cap mechanism for the electricity segment under the CPP ensures that
Powerco's operations are not exposed to volume risks, supporting stronger cash flow certainty over 2019 to 2023.
We expect the company's revenues for its regulated electricity and gas networks to decline to about NZ$330 million in
the year ending March 31, 2021, excluding the pass-through costs and customer contributions. Although Powerco does
not operate on the DPP for the electricity segment, its WACC for the remainder of the CPP will be reset in line with its
peers operating on the DPP. The extent of decline would depend on the final WACC, which would be released as part
of the final DPP in November 2019.
Powerco's operations remain stable, and we believe that it will manage its business in line with the expenditures
approved by the regulator. These investments are focused on asset renewals, network growth, and security, and are
likely to support the network reliability and availability targets in the coming years. Failure to meet the targets can
result in some penalties, and the management will closely monitor the performance to minimize such instances.

Peer comparison
• Powerco's closest peers are the two New Zealand-based regulated utilities-- Vector Ltd. and Transpower New
Zealand Ltd.--while Australian regulated utilities are also comparable.
• All peers are subject to a similar regulatory process, and hence, carry similar regulatory risks. We consider New
Zealand's regulatory framework to be at par with Australia's, thereby supporting their business risks. As a result, we
evaluate the utilities against our low volatility financial thresholds.
• All peers, except Vector, are on a revenue cap for the electricity segment. Vector will move to a revenue cap in
electricity from April 2020 under the next DPP. In addition, constraining Vector's business profile is its exposure to
the wholesale gas business. Generally, most Australian regulated utilities have minimal unregulated businesses, and
consequently, have somewhat higher margins.

Financial Risk: Aggressive
The strong regulatory regime and revenue cap for over 80% of the cash flow enable Powerco to operate with a lower
range of financial metrics for the same rating level. We assess Powerco against our lower threshold metrics (consistent
with utility peers in Australia).
We believe that the company will continue to debt fund about 60%-70% of its capital expenditure under its CPP. The
company embarked upon revising its capital structure last year to keep metrics consistent with the 'BBB' rating.
In addition, the reduction in WACC applicable from April 2020 would lead to lower cash flow for the company. The
company's alignment of its interest hedges would partially offset the decline.
All these factors will slowly weaken the company's FFO to total debt first toward 9% by fiscal 2020, and then in the
range of 7.5%-8% subsequently, from 10.5% in fiscal 2019. This tapering factors in capital spending of NZ$190
million-NZ$220 million per year (net of customer contributions), with some intra-year flexibility, and stable dividend
flows. The capital spending is likely to increase the company's debt levels to NZ$1.9 billion over the next three years.
Given Powerco's higher capital spending and debt, we don't expect the company to embark on acquisitions or to
depart from its focus on regulated businesses.
We expect Powerco to continue to operate with a buffer against its financial targets of FFO to debt of at least 7% and
regulatory leverage of below 77.5%.
The company has successfully refinanced its shareholder loan notes earlier this year. We continue to assess these
shareholder loans at Powerco's holding entity as equity-like for analytical purposes. We believe that these loan notes
would continue to retain their equity-like characteristics, including being deeply subordinated, have very limited rights
so long as senior debt is outstanding, have no right to accelerate or demand payments, or call an event of default.
Powerco New Zealand Holding Ltd. (PNZHL) is the holding entity of Powerco, has no external debt, and has
limitations on its business operations. If PNZHL's role were to change, the loan notes were to lose their equity-like
characteristics, and/or if PNZHL were to incur external debt, this remote scenario would affect our view of the overall
group, and hence, Powerco.

Liquidity: Adequate
Powerco's adequate liquidity underpins the short-term rating of 'A-2'. We expect Powerco to maintain this profile
through timely refinancing of its medium-term notes maturing February 2020 at least three months in advance. In
addition, we expect Powerco to maintain adequate funding for its capital works.
On this basis, we expect the sources of liquidity to exceed uses by 1.1x (threshold for regulated utilities) over the next
12 months, and sources to exceed uses if EBITDA were to decline by 10%. In our view, Powerco has a good standing
in credit markets--both with banks and in capital markets--and a track record of delivering on its plan.
Powerco continues to operate within the covenants under its bank and bond documents. We expect the company to
maintain sufficient headroom to its interest coverage and regulatory leverage covenants over the medium term.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

As an energy transmitter and distributor, Powerco's environmental and social risks are relatively benign compared
with electricity generators or integrated utilities, in our view.
Environmental factors are neutral because Powerco is not exposed directly to the emissions associated with fossil
fuel power generation. With a significant footprint in New Zealand's North Island, the company's social factors
include providing reliable and safe electricity and gas networks in its service area. We believe that the company is
well experienced and the risks remain neutral, given the company's track record.
Governance is neutral to our credit analysis because we view Powerco's governance practices to be consistent with
industry peers'.

Group Influence
Given Powerco's ownership by multiple funds, we do not apply our group rating methodology. PNZHL is the
immediate holding company of Powerco, and its current role is to only hold shares in Powerco. In addition, the

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

Powerco Ltd.

shareholder loan notes at PNZHL are subject to a subordination deed with limited rights so long as senior debt is
outstanding at Powerco.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
Powerco's capital structure comprises secured debt of NZ$1,298.8 million and secured committed bank facilities of
NZ$350 million.

Analytical conclusions
We rate Powerco's secured debt at 'BBB', in line with the issuer rating, given that all debt are secured and rank pari
passu. In addition, no significant elements of subordination risk are present in the capital structure.
