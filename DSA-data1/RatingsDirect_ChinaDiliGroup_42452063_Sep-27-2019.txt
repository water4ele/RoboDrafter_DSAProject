Credit Highlights
Overview
Key Strengths

Key Risks

Good profitability supported by lower use of operating lease and sale
of aircrafts.

Small operating scale in the fragmented agricultural wholesale market
with low barrier to entry and pricing power.

Slightly reduced geographic concentration in northeastern China on
the back of acquisitions in Hangzhou.

Limited management experience in the new business model and unclear
business strategy.
High and worsening financial leverage driven by debt-funded acquisitions.

Lack of clear business strategy weighs on operations despite mature agricultural wholesale markets.We expect low
single-digit growth of 2.0%-3.0% for rental and commission income in 2019-2021, given that there are no specific
business strategies or vertical value-chain synergies expected. China Dili Group (CDG; B-/Stable/--) operates in
mature and competitive markets like Heilongjiang province, which contributed 34.0% of 2018 revenue. Other markets
like Guizhou and Shandong provinces are also mature markets but the company lacks cost leadership or differentiation
while most of its tenants are price-sensitive farmers.
Hangzhou acquisitions helped the company expand outside northeastern China, but scale remains small. We believe
the company's geographical expansion has improved as the newly acquired Hangzhou properties is expected to
increase from 14.0% in 2018 to 27.0% in 2019, after we account for the full-year impact. That said, the overall scale
remains small, thereby limiting further upside on the rental income growth.

Hada acquisition to result in high leverage and will remain elevated during the next 12-24 months. CDG's debt position
increased in 2018, driven by the consolidation of the existing debt from the Hangzhou acquisitions of Chinese renminbi
(RMB) 571.7 million. CDG had no debt except operating lease liability prior to that.
We expect the debt levels to further increase on account of planned issuance of convertible bonds worth RMB5.4
billion to fund the Hada acquisition in the second half of 2019. Nonetheless, it will no longer incur operating lease
expenses and with the sale of its two aircrafts, EBITDA margins is likely to improve slightly to 42%-43% in 2019-2021
to temper the rising leverage.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook over the next 12 months reflects our view that CDG's agribusiness will continue to generate
stable cash flows.

Downside scenario
We could lower the rating if CDG aggressively uses debt to support business expansion or large acquisitions,
leading to a substantial increase in leverage and an unsustainable capital structure. We could also lower the rating
if CDG's liquidity worsens severely.

Upside scenario
The rating upside is limited in the next 12 months, given its highly leveraged position--which we believe is unlikely
to significantly improve due to recent acquisitions. At the same time, CDG has yet to demonstrate a longer record
of prudent financial management and of successfully operating its new business model.

• The agricultural wholesale market in China will grow

• We expect average rental and commission income
to grow between 2.0%-3.0% in 2019-2021, in line
with China's agricultural wholesale market growth.
Revenue is expected to grow by 20%-23% in 2019,
given the first full-year impact from the Hangzhou
acquisitions. Going ahead, the growth will stabilize
between 3.5%-6.0% in 2020-2021.

• EBITDA margin expected to improve to

This on account of absence of significant
maintenance expenses incurred on the aircrafts that
were sold off in 2018 and related expenses from the
Hangzhou acquisitions.
• We expect the capex of RMB200 million-RMB500.0
million in 2019-2020 towards enlarging trading and
rental space, upgrading infrastructure, as well as
installing new software and technology. This will be
funded through the part of the proceeds from rights
issues.
• We expect debt/EBITDA to rise to 12x-14x in 2019
as against 5.0x in 2018 on the back of the Hada
acquisition.

Company Description
CDG is an operator of wholesale agriculture markets in China. It currently operates in 10 markets across seven cities in
China: Harbin, Qiqihar, Shenyang, Guiyang, Mudanjiang, Shouguang, and Hangzhou. Out of the 10 markets, seven are
on lease since July 2015 from Yield Smart Ltd.--which was controlled by the wife of CDG's former chairman Mr. Dai
Yongge. The other three markets in Hangzhou are owned by CDG and were recently acquired in July 2018 from an
independent third party. The company primarily generates rental and commission income through these markets that
engage in the wholesaling and retailing of primarily vegetables, fruits, seafood, meat, grain, oil, and other food produce.

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 13, 2019 5

China Dili Group

Mr. Dai directly and indirectly holds about 70% of total issued shared capital through other special-purpose vehicles.

Business Risk: Vulnerable
CDG operates on a small scale in a highly competitive and fragmented industry. We expect CDG's pricing power to be
very limited, considering its highly cost-sensitive tenants--thereby limiting the rental and commission growth to a low
single-digit percentage. Further, we believe there is a lack of clear business strategy to address current weaknesses.
CDG's geographic concentration in northeastern China remains a risk although it has modestly reduced post the
acquisition of three agricultural wholesale markets in Hangzhou in July 2018. Revenue contribution from these
properties is expected to nearly double in 2019, given the full-year accounting. Zhejiang's GDP growth in 2018 is also
higher than the national average growth and even higher than other northeastern provinces (where CDG is present).
Therefore, we believe the expansion into Hangzhou could present stronger growth prospects.
CDG's good profitability stems from its historically lower lease expenses and its cash generating business. We believe
the company's operating cost will reduce moderately once it acquires the land on which its markets operate because it
will no longer incur lease expenses. In addition, the sale of its aircrafts will also support margins due to a reduction in
related maintenance expenses. However, CDG's high fixed cost due to administrative and staff expenses will partly
offset the benefits. We believe the company will require ongoing cost-cutting initiatives to turn around the company.

RMB--Chinese renminbi.

We consider China South City Holdings Ltd. (CSC; B-/Positive/--) and Rekeep S.p.A. (B/Stable/--) as CDG's peers.
CSC's and CDG's business models are somewhat related. CSC develops trade centers while CDG operates them.
The key differences between CSC and CDG are: (1) sources of revenue--sale of properties remains CSC's key revenue
driver, even though the company's rental income is gradually increasing: and (2) product type.
We believe CSC has a better scale as well as geographic and product diversity than CDG. It therefore has a better
market position. CSC also has better brand recognition due to its first-mover advantage. CSC and Rekeep have a larger
operating scale, better geographic diversification, and a more established brand name than CDG.
CDG and Rekeep operate in fragmented businesses and both engage in the facilities services. Rekeep is involved in
facility management/maintenance services and laundering/sterilization services in Italy. It operates on a nationwide
level and is the market leader in facility management services. Its operating scale is much larger than CDG's.
CDG has more stable cash flows and higher profitability than both its peers due to its lower expenses in leasing in the
agricultural market and support from shareholders. Their liquidity sources sufficiently covered their uses due to their
adequate cash balance and low capex and debt repayment in the last two years.

Financial Risk: Highly leveraged
CDG has a record of weak and imprudent financial management. Its Hada acquisition was initially planned to be
completed by 2018, which is now expected to be completed in the second half of 2019. We forecast this will
significantly increase its leverage position to 12x-14x as measured by debt to EBITDA over the next 12 months,
against 5.0x in 2018. This will be mainly driven by the company's plan to issue a 10-year zero coupon convertible bond
to the controlling shareholder to fund the acquisition. Post-transaction, we expect the debt-to-EBITDA ratio to slowly
reduce to 10x-12x in 2020--given that it will have no lease liability once the company owns the operational properties.
Given the uncertainty regarding the time of conversion to equity for the bond, we assume it will stay as debt in our
forecast period. There is very low risk with regards to refinancing or repayment in the case of convertible debt, given
that the major debtholder is also a major CDG shareholder, who we believe will likely convert its holding into equity.
Given that CDG will have significantly higher leverage post-transaction as well as its poor credit standing in the

market, it may need to use equity financing or cash for any future acquisitions.

Liquidity: Less than adequate
We assess CDG's liquidity as less than adequate, despite its sources of liquidity being sufficiently higher than its uses in
the coming 12 months.
The assessment mainly reflects our view that CDG does not have a record of proven banking relationships. Moreover,
the company has a poor credit standing following the covenant breach in a bilateral loan in 2016 and a distressed
exchange in early 2015.

Other Credit Considerations
In our view, CDG has a short record of operating its restructured business after the distressed exchange and business
restructuring in early 2015. The company has a largely unclear strategy to grow its business. In our opinion, CDG is
yet to demonstrate a longer record of successful strategic execution and planning, enhanced business and financial risk
management, and corporate governance practices that promote independence between the board and management.
We evaluate CDG's management and governance as weak, based on these factors.
