Weaker credit measures in 2020.

Restructured contracts with Southwestern Energy will affect cash flows and credit metrics in 2019 and 2020.Texas Gas
Transmission LLC (Texas Gas) restructured its contracts with Southwestern Energy in the Fayetteville and Greenville
laterals in late 2017. We expect the company will feel the impact of this restructuring in 2019 and 2020, especially
since Southwestern Energy is Texas Gas' largest shipper in these two laterals. The Fayetteville Lateral is located
primarily in Arkansas and transports natural gas from the Fayetteville shale production area to Texas Gas' pipelines,
while the Greenville Lateral is located in Mississippi. Texas Gas had initially placed these expansion projects into
service between 2008 and 2010.
The restructured contract's terms include an extension through 2030 at much lower rates and reduces Southwestern's
existing volume commitment on the Fayetteville lateral from 800,000 million British thermal units (mmBtu) per day to
100,000 mmBtu per day in November 2017 through October 2020 at existing rates. Starting in 2021, committed
volumes on the Fayetteville and Greenville laterals will increase.
On Dec. 3, 2018, Southwestern sold its Fayetteville and Greenville assets to Flywheel Energy (unrated). As part of the
sale, Flywheel Energy must fulfill Southwestern's commitments to Texas Gas. We view this unfavorably because the
restructured contracts will continue to hurt cash flows and credit metrics in 2019 and 2020.
Revenues are independent of gas prices, making them less volatile. Texas Gas is a single asset natural gas pipe and
does not benefit from any company integration. Additionally, there is minimal commodity price exposure. An
overwhelming majority of Texas Gas' revenues are derived from long-term transportation contracts whose revenues
are independent of gas prices.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on Texas Gas reflects that of Boardwalk Pipeline Partners L.P. Our stable outlook on Boardwalk
Pipeline Partners L.P. reflects our expectation that its adjusted debt to EBITDA will be 4.5x-5.0x in both 2019 and
2020. We expect Boardwalk's capital spending will remain relatively high in 2019 as the company focuses on
growth projects backed by long-term contracts. While the company still has some significant contract expirations
in 2019 and 2020, we expect lower contracting rates to be offset by growth projects that were recently
implemented or will be in 2019 and 2020. The company's largest growth project is the Coastal Bend Header
project relating to Boardwalk's other subsidiary, Gulf South.

Downside scenario
The most likely downside scenario for Texas Gas would be a downgrade of Boardwalk. We would lower the rating
on Boardwalk if its growth projects have delays or cost overruns, or if the company renews material contracts that
are expiring over the next two years at much lower rates than we expect, increasing leverage above 5.5x on a
sustained basis.

Upside scenario
We could raise the rating on Texas Gas if we raised the rating on Boardwalk. We could consider a positive rating
action if Boardwalk recontracts material projects rolling off at acceptable rates, executes its growth projects, and
maintains debt to EBITDA in the low-4x range.

Our Base-Case Scenario
Assumptions

• Macroeconomic variables are not key drivers of our
forecast due to the contracted nature of Texas Gas'
cash flows.
• Revenue decline of about 10% in 2019 due to lower
volumes relating to the renegotiated Southwestern
transportation contracts.

Company Description
Texas Gas is one of the primary entities in Boardwalk's pipeline and storage business. It is a long-haul interstate

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 20, 2019 4

Texas Gas Transmission LLC

natural gas pipeline that moves gas from Gulf Coast supply areas to on-system markets in the midwest and off-system
markets in the northeast. It is composed of approximately 5,975 miles of pipeline, with an average daily throughput of
approximately 2.8 billion cubic ft. (Bcf) per day. It owns nine natural gas storage fields located in Indiana and
Kentucky, with working gas storage capacity of approximately 84 Bcf of gas. Boardwalk has made portions of the
Texas Gas system bi-directional in order to transport natural gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale regions to
Louisiana due to an overabundance of natural gas supply in the system's northern end market. Having a bi-directional
pipeline in the north allows it to further diversify and benefit from supply there. Texas Gas directly serves local
distribution companies, municipalities, and power generators.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
The satisfactory business risk profile reflects the large percentage of fixed-fee revenues, primarily investment-grade
customer base, and the impact of the pressures on contract renewal rates. The rating on Texas Gas reflects our
assessment of the credit quality of its parent, Boardwalk Pipeline Partners. Over 90% of Boardwalk's revenues are
subscribed under long-term firm contracts, mainly with investment-grade customers. Roughly 80% of revenues come
from capacity reservation charges, which are independent of throughput levels. The average weighted contract life for
Texas Gas' transportation capacity is about 5.5 years. An overwhelming majority of Texas Gas' revenues are derived
from long-term natural gas transportation contracts that have revenues independent of gas prices but that depend on
agreements from natural gas producers.

Chart 1

For Texas Gas, 20% of contracts roll off in 2019 and 12.5% in 2020. We believe that re-contracted volumes could be at
significantly lower rates and that these new growth projects are critical to Texas Gas' growth as existing contracts roll
off.
Changing market dynamics resulting from an oversupply of shale gas and weaker basis differentials could further
pressure rates for contract renewals. The decline in volumes transported on the Fayetteville lateral have affected
Texas Gas in its restructured contracts with Southwestern at less favorable terms. Southwestern negotiated lower
prices in exchange for extending the contract term to 2030, whereas the original contract expired in 2021.

Financial Risk: Modest
Texas Gas' stand-alone financial risk profile is stronger than that of its parent. We view Texas Gas' financial risk profile
as modest and expect debt to EBITDA to be below 2.5x in the next two years. We assume that Texas Gas will manage
its short-term cash shortfalls via its cash management program with Boardwalk. We do not expect Texas Gas to issue
any debt.

Liquidity: Adequate
We assess Texas Gas' liquidity as adequate. As of June 30, 2019, its revolving credit facility, with availability of $400
million, was undrawn. We expect liquidity sources to exceed uses by more than 2x over the next 12 months, which
would usually indicate a "strong" assessment. However, qualitative factors, such as the company's ability to access the
debt capital markets during a period of financial stress, limits our assessment at adequate.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Cash on hand of about $26 million as of June 30,
2019;

• Capital spending of about $35 million over the next
12 months; and

• Funds from operations of $200 million-$220 million
over the next 12 months;

• Advances of $180 million to Boardwalk over the
next 12 months.

• Working capital inflows of $5 million-$10 million
over the next 12 months; and
• As of June 30, 2019, full availability of the
company's $400 million revolving credit facility,
which matures in May 2022.

Covenant Analysis
Compliance expectations
At June 30, 2019, Texas Gas was in compliance with its debt covenants, and we believe it will remain in compliance
with its covenants over the next 12 months.

Requirements
Boardwalk has a revolving credit facility that includes itself, Texas Gas, Gulf South, and Gulf Crossing as borrowers.
Boardwalk's revolver covenants require the partnership and its subsidiaries to maintain a maximum total leverage ratio
of 5.0x, which steps up to 5.5x for the three quarters following an acquisition and includes pro forma cash flow credit
for projects under construction.

Group Influence
The issuer credit rating on Texas Gas is capped at 'BBB-', which is the same as Boardwalk. Under our group rating
methodology, we assess Texas Gas as a core subsidiary of Boardwalk, reflecting our view that it is highly unlikely to be
sold, operates in lines of business that are integral to the overall group strategy, and has a strong long-term
commitment from senior management.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
As of June 30, 2019, Texas Gas' capital structure consists of its senior unsecured revolving credit facility, with a
borrowing capacity of $400 million, $440 million 4.5% senior unsecured notes due 2021, and $100 million 7.25% senior
unsecured notes due 2027.

Analytical conclusions
The unsecured debt rating is 'BBB-' which is the same as the issuer credit rating because there is no structural or
contractual subordination of the issues.
