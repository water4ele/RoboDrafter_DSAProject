Key Strengths

Key Risks

Good geographic diversification in Europe.

Relatively small size compared with European peers.

Solid market position and brand awareness in the Baltic countries.

Regulatory and taxation risks inherent in the gaming industry.

Significant barriers to entry given the relatively high initial casino
investments need.

Limited product diversification.

Sound cash flow generation.

Financial sponsor ownership and lack of clarity around shareholder
remuneration.

Regulatory and reputational risk add pressure to the company's profitability and future growth.European gaming
companies are facing increasing regulatory and fiscal challenges, as governments attempt to tackle the social risks
associated with gambling. The regulatory environment in the Baltic region has historically been more favorable and
stable than in other European countries. However, Estonia-based gaming company, Odyssey Europe Holdco S.a.r.l's
(Olympic Entertainment Group AS's) operations could be affected by a series of government decisions. In 2018, Latvia
increased taxes per device by 30%, and in 2019, Italy further increased its gaming tax on slot machines. Meanwhile, in
2017, Riga City Council introduced a law to ban gambling venues in the city's historical centre, except those located in
four-star or five-star hotels.
As a consequence, Olympic will need to close seven venues by the end of 2022. Moreover, Riga City Council is now
considering expanding the same ban to the entire city, and, if approved, 23 additional Olympic venues will have to
close by end-2024.
Good geographic diversification partially offsets Olympic's small size.In terms of revenue (about €220 million) and
EBITDA (€45 million-€50 million), Olympic is among the smallest gaming operators that we rate in Europe, which
makes it particularly vulnerable to external changes; for example, economic, political, regulatory, or sector trends.
While the rest of the industry is showing a tendency toward consolidation, Olympic's revenue base has remained
unchanged, and the company does not plan any material acquisitions. Despite its small size, Olympic's operations are
much more diversified that those of other rated peers (which operate in only one country). The company operates in
six different European countries, offering it a natural hedge against country-specific headwinds.

Solid cash-flow generation supports the credit metrics.Similar to several other gaming operators, Olympic enjoys a
solid cash conversion relative to its business size, and we expect reported free operating cash flow (FOCF) to stay
positive at around €20 million-€25 million per year in our two-year projection period (roughly half of reported
EBITDA). This is a result of the limited working capital and capital expenditure (capex) needs, as the company is
mostly focused on increasing traffic to existing venues rather than opening new casinos. Good cash generation
supports the company's metrics with S&P Global Ratings-adjusted leverage at about 4.5x, and FOCF to debt at about
10%.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our expectation that Olympic will maintain its leverage at around 4.5x for the next 12
months, while continuing to generate positive FOCF. The stable outlook also reflects our expectation that the
financial sponsors will keep their commitment to maintaining a financial policy that supports moderate
deleveraging through EBITDA growth, along with adequate liquidity.

Downside scenario
We could lower the rating over the next 12 months if the company reported revenues materially below our
base-case forecast, with an EBITDA margin below 20%, such that adjusted leverage increases above 6.5x or FOCF
to debt turns negative. This could occur if any unexpected regulatory changes in the main operating countries
result in the closure of casinos, or if potential taxation increases materially deteriorate the company's profitability.
It could also occur if the company incurred any debt-financed acquisitions, or if capex was materially higher than
expected, leading to negative FOCF generation.
We could also lower the rating if we saw evidence of a more aggressive financial policy resulting in a sustained
weakening of Olympic's credit metrics--for example, through the distribution of significant dividends.

Upside scenario
We see an upgrade as unlikely in the next 12 months, given our expectation that leverage will remain at around
4.5x, and the lack of a track record on the financial sponsor and its long-term financial policy.
However, we could consider a positive rating action once the financial sponsor has a longer track record and we
have a clear view on its commitment to maintain a financial policy that supports lower leverage. In this case, we
could upgrade the rating if Olympic manages to significantly increase revenues and EBITDA base without
incurring material additional debt, or if the company pays down debt, leading to an adjusted debt to EBITDA at
4.0x-4.5x on a sustainable basis. We consider that Olympic could achieve operating outperformance if it opened a
higher-than-expected number of casinos, resulting in a significant increase of scale and gain in market share.

SEPTEMBER 25, 2019 3

Odyssey Europe Holdco S.à r.l

Assumptions

• We expect improving macroeconomic prospects in
the Baltics, with real GDP growing by 2.0%-4.0% per
year and a declining unemployment rate in
Olympic's three biggest markets.
• The company will benefit from this supportive
macroeconomic environment over the next two
years, given that casinos are considered
discretionary leisure activities and therefore are
exposed to the population's living standards.
• Over the next two years, we expect like-for-like net
revenue before gaming taxes to grow between
2.0%-3.0%, driven by the strengthening of online
operations and an increase in existing casinos'
traffic, thanks to marketing initiatives and the use of
analytics.

• We expect adjusted EBITDA margins will stabilize
at around 25%-26% (equivalent to about 20%-21%
reported EBITDA margin).
• We include a €30 million distribution to
shareholders paid during the first half of 2019; €10
million of which was from the shareholders'
allowance, and €20 million of which was reduced
from the equity capital. The shareholder's allowance
basket had accumulated from 50% of past net
profits.
• No acquisitions are included in the base case.

Base-case projections
Credit metrics look resilient to potential operating underperformance. We expect Olympic's debt as well as EBITDA to
remain relatively solid, leading to an adjusted leverage of 4.5x during 2019-2020, while FFO to debt will remain at
around 15%. Given the company's leverage and relatively sound cash flow generation, we believe it has some
headroom under the existing rating, and that leverage metrics are unlikely to materially change if revenue or EBITDA
margin deviates from our base case by up to 400 basis points in either direction.
We are not assessing Olympic's financial profile in a stronger category given the company's lack of a financial policy
track record. In addition, we note that the credit metrics amelioration between 2018 and 2019 is mostly due to the fact
that the entity reported for only 10 months in 2018.
Olympic's cash conversion will remain strong in the absence of material acquisitions or an aggressive expansion plan.
We believe the company will continue to generate positive FOCF, supported by its prudent expansion strategy and
lack of working capital needs. Olympic does not plan any acquisition in the future as it aims to grow organically by
increasing traffic and spending per visit in existing sites. Capex is expected to remain quite moderate at around €15

million per year in our projection period. For 2019, maintenance capex is around €11 million, while the remaining €4
million is related to the Lithuania flagship casino renovation.

Company Description
Based in Tallinn, Estonia, Olympic is a pan-European provider of casinos and land-based and online gaming services,
with a strong presence in the Baltic region. Founded in 1993, the company operated 114 casinos and 23 betting points
in six countries by the end of 2018, namely Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Italy, Slovakia, and Malta. In fiscal year ending
Dec. 31, 2018, Olympic generated €175.1 million of revenue.

Business Risk: Weak
Our business assessment is constrained by Olympic's small size compared with peers, limited product diversification,
and the unfavorable regulatory risk. We expect Olympic's revenue to be at €228 million-€240 million in 2019, which
positions the company as one of the smallest European rated gaming operators. Olympic's product offering is quite
narrow, as the company derives around 85% of revenue from land-based gaming--primarily table and slot
machines--and only 5% from online gaming. The remaining 10% of sales is generated through a variety of ancillary
services such as bars, restaurants, and hotels, which we see as strongly correlated to the performance of the casinos,
and therefore not providing any real diversification. We believe its relatively small size and product concentration
make Olympic particularly exposed to high-impact adverse changes (for example, economic, political, regulatory, or
sector trends), which are only partially offset by the geographic diversification of sales.
Even if the regulatory environment in the Baltic region has historically been more favorable and stable than other
European countries, lately there have been some adverse regulatory changes, and we believe that the risk of further
changes cannot be ignored. Besides general regulatory risk, Olympic is also exposed to legal and reputational risks,
following the Lithuanian gaming control authority's recent allegations that Olympia had violated laws related to the
prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, for which it imposed a €0.5 million fine.
These constraints are somewhat mitigated by Olympic's leading position and strong brand in the Baltic region, as well
as its solid geographical diversification. The company currently holds the No. 1 position in Estonia and Lithuania, and
No. 2 position in Latvia, in land-based gross gaming revenue (GGR) market share. We believe Olympic's market
position is protected by these countries' significant barriers to entry--a result of the high fixed gaming tax expenses,
which depress margins for smaller casino operators. We also view the fact that Olympic operates in six different
European countries as an advantage compared with peers, although we acknowledge that it generates 85% of total
EBITDA in the Baltics.

Financial Risk: Highly leveraged
Olympic's financial assessment is constrained by its financial sponsor ownership. After the company was bought out
by private equity firm Novalpina Capital in 2018, adjusted leverage increased to 4.6x from 1.1x in 2017.
First-half 2019 operating results are broadly in line with our forecast. Revenue increased by almost 4.0% compared
with the first half of 2018, thanks to the solid performance in Lithuania and Latvia, while Slovakia showed a small
decline. Reported EBITDA margin weakened slightly, from 26.3% to 25.8%, because of higher staff costs and other
operating expenses.
Our adjusted debt calculation includes around €60 million of operating-lease debt, as Olympic leases all of its venues.
In our base case, we are not expecting any variation in adjusted debt and just a modest growth of adjusted EBITDA,
leading to a leverage decline of about 0.1x per year. Additionally, the solid cash generation will translate into FOCF to
Debt slightly above 10%.
We note that the €30 million distribution to shareholders during the first half of 2019 was not part of our precedent
base case. Although we do not exclude the possibility of further equity remuneration in the future, we expect
Novalpina's financial policy to continue supporting Olympic's current credit metrics, and thus the ratings.

Liquidity: Adequate
We assess Olympic's liquidity position as adequate, and we think that sources of cash should exceed uses of cash by
more than 2x over the 12 months starting June 30, 2019. The new revolving credit facility (RCF), solid cash flow
generation, and the absence of debt-repayment requirements supports our assessment of Olympic's liquidity position.
We also expect Olympic to remain compliant with the incurrence financial covenants of its RCF, even if EBITDA
declines by 15%.
In our view, the company has generally prudent risk management, but we think that Olympic is unlikely to be able to
absorb high-impact, low-probability events without needing refinancing, given its small size and the industry's
volatility.

Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Cash and equivalents of about €40 million
(excluding about €20 million of restricted cash);

• No seasonal working capital outflow; and
• Capex of about €15 million.

• Forecast FFO of about €30 million to €35 million
over the next 12 months; and
• €25 million undrawn RCF.

Covenant Analysis
The company has a springing covenant on the RCF when utilization is greater than 35%, set at a maximum
consolidated super senior secured net leverage ratio of 0.79:1 at each measurement period. The RCF is currently fully
undrawn, after it was repaid in July 2019.
The company is expected to have enough headroom under the springing covenant.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

A common approach to socially responsible investment (SRI) is to avoid investing in activities considered unethical
or potentially addictive, and the gambling industry is frequently excluded from investment portfolios due to the
social impact of gambling addiction. So far, SRI seems to be having a negligible affect on demand for the gaming
industry's debt. However, if the socially controversial industries suffer in the long term as regulations and
consumer tastes shift demand away from these products, it could affect Olympic as well as the overall industry.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
• Olympic's reported gross debt of €225 million, primarily comprising the €200 million senior secured notes due 2023
and the €25 million undrawn super senior RCF due 2022.
• All debt is issued at the parent level (Odyssey Europe Holdco).
• The senior secured notes are subordinated to the super senior RCF and are not guaranteed on the issuance date.
• We also consider that the security package under the senior secured notes is relatively weak, consisting only of bank
accounts, the ultimate parent company's shares in the issuer, and related intragroup receivables.

Analytical conclusions
Olympic's debt is rated 'B', mirroring the issuer credit rating, because no significant elements of subordination risk are
present in the capital structure.
