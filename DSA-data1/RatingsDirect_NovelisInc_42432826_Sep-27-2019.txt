Novelis Inc. is the world's largest producer of flat rolled aluminum products and recycler of aluminum.The company
shipped 3,274 kilotonnes (kt; as of fiscal year 2019 ending March 31, 2019) of rolled aluminum compared with 1,534kt
(2018) at Constellium N.V. (B/Stable/--) and 1,249kt (2018) at Arconic Inc. (BBB-/Negative/A-3). In our view, the
company's significant scale, which spans North America, Europe, South America, and Asia, and established market
position provide competitive advantages that should sustain long-term production. Novelis' customer base includes
many large multinational customers based primarily in the can and automotive markets, and the company is an
exclusive supplier to certain global automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).
Novelis has an established position as an early entrant in the higher-margin automotive market. Increased aluminum
penetration in the automotive market is driven mainly by efficiency considerations (aluminum is lighter than steel).
Novelis supplies aluminum sheet for the Ford F-150 platform (the highest selling vehicle globally in 2018); we expect
automotive shipments will continue to exhibit higher growth and margin prospects relative to its comparably mature
can business (and increase as a share of Novelis' consolidated sales, which currently account for about 25%).
Notwithstanding recent and expected slowing in light vehicle sales globally, the company has outsize exposure to
more aluminum-intensive larger vehicles (such as light trucks and SUVs) and new capacity investments are expected
to support future growth.
Pending Aleris acquisition will increase leverage and reduce financial flexibility. The US$2.6 billion acquisition will be
100% debt financed and is expected to close in late 2019/early 2020 (calendar year). We estimate that by fiscal
year-end 2021, adjusted debt-to-EBITDA will increase to the mid-4x area, which is commensurate with our issuer
credit rating on Novelis. However, in our view, there is a degree of uncertainty regarding future earnings and cash flow

on a pro forma basis, as well as integration risk. Moreover, the integration will likely take place during the ramp-up of
new production capacity--automotive finishing facilities in the U.S. and China and can plant expansion in Brazil--which
poses operating and cost-overrun risks. In our view, the company has limited rating capacity for new debt-financed
initiatives or materially weaker operating results in the early stages of the Aleris integration.
Chart 1

Novelis has demonstrated steady improvement in its financial profile over the past several years, but parent ownership
constrains rating upside. Novelis and its ultimate parent, Hindalco Industries Ltd., have materially reduced leverage in
recent years, and Novelis has not paid dividends for several years. However, while not expected, dividends paid to
Hindalco (for example, in the event of sustainably weak operating results) would likely weaken the credit profile of
Novelis and the combined group.

SEPTEMBER 10, 2019 3

Novelis Inc.

Outlook: Stable

We expect Novelis to generate leverage in the mid-4x area in fiscal 2021 following the completion of its planned
debt-financed Aleris acquisition assumed in late 2019/early 2020 (calendar year). We estimate that prior to closing,
Novelis will generate steady earnings and margins, with internally generated cash flow sufficient to fund sharply
higher capital investments for capacity expansion. Over this period, we assume ultimate parent Hindalco maintains
a commitment to leverage well below historical levels, with no dividends upstreamed from Novelis.

Downside scenario
We could downgrade the company over the next 12 to 24 months if we expect Novelis' adjusted debt-to-EBITDA
to increase above 5x or funds from operations (FFO)-to-debt to decline below 12% on a sustained basis. In this
scenario, we anticipate weaker-than-expected automotive and can market demand fundamentals, leading to lower
earnings and cash flow that limit the company's ability to internally fund its growth initiatives and reduce leverage
following its Aleris acquisition.

Upside scenario
We view an upgrade over the next 12 months as unlikely, particularly given the expected increase in leverage
following the company's proposed acquisition of Aleris. However, to contemplate an upgrade, we would expect
Novelis to generate and maintain adjusted debt-to-EBITDA that approaches 3x and FFO-to-debt over 20%. In this
scenario, a materially higher proportion of shipments to automotive customers (well above 20% for stand-alone
Novelis) and much improved outlook for Aleris' operating results would likely be required. In addition, a higher
rating would be contingent on a stronger assessment of Novelis' group credit profile, likely requiring continuing
earnings and cash flow growth, as well as continued deleveraging at Hindalco.

Our Base-Case Scenario
We expect Novelis will continue to generate relatively stable credit measures in fiscal 2020 (on a stand-alone basis),
following solid improvement in fiscal 2019. We estimate its adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio in the mid-3x area before
the closing of the Aleris acquisition (which Novelis now expects in late 2019/early 2020 (calendar year)). Generally
stable EBITDA and adjusted debt underpin our estimates. We expect an increase in leverage from the debt-funded
transaction, but assume pro forma adjusted debt-to-EBITDA declines to the mid-4x area by fiscal year-end 2021 and
further improves in fiscal 2022.
We assume lower average aluminum prices offset the impact of shipment growth on revenue (aluminum prices are a
pass-through to the company's customers) and constrain earnings and cash flow growth this year. However, we
estimate modestly stronger margins, led by healthy demand from its automotive customers-–notably for more
aluminum-intensive platforms (such as pick-up trucks and SUVs), and for growth to resume next year. Moreover, can
market conditions have exceeded our expectations in recent quarters, and we believe modest growth (low-single digits
compared with our previous flat expectations) in this segment will continue at least through this fiscal year.

Novelis Inc.

Prior to deal closing, we assume stable debt levels based on about breakeven free cash flow. The company's capital
expenditures will sharply increase from last year mainly for automotive (U.S., China) and can (Brazil) capacity
expansions, funded with internal cash flow generation. In fiscal 2021, we assume cash flow from Aleris and lower
consolidated capital expenditures will primarily fuel free cash flow generation, and mitigate the impact of the US$2.6
billion debt-financed Aleris acquisition on Novelis' credit measures.

Assumptions

• Steady stand-alone shipment growth (single-digit
percent year-over-year) in fiscal 2020–-just above
S&P Global Ratings' assumptions for GDP growth in
Novelis' core markets--with a growing proportion of
auto shipments.
• Aluminum price of US$1,800 per ton (/t) for the rest
of 2019, US$2,000/t in 2020, and US$2,100/t in
2021.
• Slowing growth in global light-vehicle production,
with a 2%-3% decline in 2019 and only a marginal
recovery in the next two years, but for Novelis to
benefit from its high exposure to the more
aluminum-intensive and higher-growth light truck
and SUV segments.

Company Description
Novelis is the largest global producer of rolled aluminum products, with geographically well-diversified operations in
the U.S., Europe, South America, and Asia (24 operating facilities in 10 countries). The company uses primary and
recycled aluminum mainly to produce sheet used predominantly by producers of food and beverage cans, rolled
products increasingly for auto applications, and specialty products. In July 2018, Novelis announced its planned

SEPTEMBER 10, 2019 6

Novelis Inc.

acquisition of Aleris International for US$2.6 billion, which is expected to be 100% debt-financed. The company is
wholly owned by Hindalco (based in India), is headquartered in Atlanta, and employs approximately 11,000.
Chart 3

Business Risk: Satisfactory
In our view, the company's significant operating breadth, leading competitive position, and increasing penetration in
the automotive sector underpin our assessment of its business. The company has long-term relationships with many of
its large multinational customers, and is an exclusive supplier to certain global automotive OEMs. We believe Novelis'
globally diversified operations will continue to provide economies of scale and scope, and reduce the company's
reliance on a specific market. We expect Aleris will strengthen Novelis' business through enhanced scale and added
exposure to new automotive customers and other, higher-margin segments (such as aerospace).
We expect Novelis will continue to benefit from the growing penetration of aluminum in automotive applications--a
trend driven mainly by fuel efficiency considerations. The company has an established position as an early entrant to
this market; it supplies aluminum sheet for the Ford F-150 platform (the largest selling vehicle globally) and is a key
supplier to Jaguar Land Rover. Its recent and planned automotive aluminum sheet manufacturing plant expansions in

SEPTEMBER 10, 2019 7

Novelis Inc.

the U.S. and China should accommodate future growth from this market (though we expect some short-term volatility).
Despite a relatively modest share of overall shipments to the automotive sector (and accounted for 25% of sales in
fiscal first-quarter 2020), we expect a steady increase in the next several years and for this sector to remain a key
driver of profitability.
The company's average EBITDA margins and returns on capital have remained above 10% over the past two fiscal
years, which we view as above average for global metals processors and distributors. We estimate these profitability
measures to remain relatively stable post-Aleris integration, with limited downside related to commodity market
volatility. Specifically, the cost of aluminum--which has weakened year-over-year--is largely a pass-through, and
growing use of recycled aluminum in production (61% of inputs in fiscal 2019 versus 33% in fiscal 2011) affords
efficiency gains. That said, Novelis remains exposed to metals price lag: Basically, the difference in local market
premiums between the prices paid for inputs and finished product prices, which the company cannot effectively hedge.
Our assessment also incorporates the company's exposure to cyclical and competitive aluminum conditions, and
customer end-market volatility. In addition, can sheet accounts for the majority of Novelis' sales (more than 50% in
fiscal 2019), with lower growth and margin prospects relative to the majority of Novelis' end markets. However, we
recognize the relatively recent improvement in can market fundamentals; we believe tighter capacity in most markets
(excluding China) reflects increasing customer preferences for sustainable packaging, which should support shipment
growth above our previously flat expectations.

Financial Risk: Aggressive
We expect Novelis to generate relatively stable credit measures in fiscal 2020, in advance of its debt-financed
acquisition of Aleris expected later this fiscal year. On a stand-alone basis, we estimate the company's adjusted
debt-to-EBITDA ratio at 3.7x-–about in line with fiscal 2019 (3.6x), which was modestly below our previous estimates
and well aligned with the rating. For fiscal 2021, we estimate pro forma leverage (including US$2.6 billion in debt
funding) in the mid-4x area, and for leverage to improve thereafter.
Since 2016, Novelis' credit profile has materially improved through a combination of cash flow growth and debt
reduction, and we believe the company is committed to deleveraging following the acquisition. We believe that, as
large growth-related investments decline, the company will generate positive free cash flow in 2021 that facilitates net
debt reduction. Our estimates for Novelis' earnings and cash flow are underpinned by increased capacity to take
advantage of what we expect will be healthy automotive and can market fundamentals, and high recycled content of
production that supports favorable margins at least over the next two years.
Our assessment also incorporates a degree of volatility in Novelis' business, notably related to aluminum price
fluctuations. In addition, there is a degree of uncertainty regarding the company's future earnings profile post-Aleris
closing, which includes integration risk. We expect the company will close the Aleris acquisition while maintaining
leverage commensurate for the ratings. However, Novelis' willingness to materially increase leverage to complete the
deal (to levels above our current estimates), and Hindalco's history of dividends from Novelis are captured in our
negative financial policy modifier.
The ratings also incorporate our view of the combined group credit profile of Novelis and ultimate parent Hindalco.
We view the group as having the same credit profile as Novelis on a stand-alone basis. Our assessment of the group
credit profile is predominantly weighted toward Novelis (over two-thirds of combined revenue and operating earnings)
but takes into account Hindalco stand-alone credit profile. Hindalco has also publicly committed to leverage well
below historical levels, though debt repayment this year is not expected. Although potential dividend payments to

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

Novelis Inc.

Hindalco remain a risk to our rating on Novelis, we view this as unlikely at least over the next 12 months, particularly
given the pending Aleris acquisition.

Liquidity: Strong
We view Novelis' liquidity as adequate. We expect the company's sources of cash will exceed uses by more than 1.5x
in the next 12 months (over 3.0x) and remain above 1.0x in the subsequent 12 months, even if EBITDA were to decline
by 50%. Novelis' quantitative measures (that is, cash sources over uses, sources less uses) are consistent with a
stronger liquidity profile. However, in our view, the company does not have the requisite supporting liquidity
characteristics for a higher assessment, including covenant headroom, ability to manage high-impact, low-probability
events without refinancing, credit standing, and risk management.

Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Cash of about US$859 million at June 30, 2019

• Capital expenditures of about US$750 million in
fiscal 2020 and lower in the subsequent 12 months

• US$870 million under its committed revolving credit
facilities
• FFO of just over US$760 million over the next 12
months and over US$1 billion in the subsequent 12
months

• No dividends
• Modest estimated working capital requirements
We assume Novelis funds the US$2.6 billion acquisition
of Aleris (expected in fourth-quarter fiscal 2020) with
debt-–initially with a bridge loan that is repaid with
long-term debt.

Debt maturities
Novelis does not have material debt maturities until 2022, which provides financial flexibility. The company's US$1.8
billion term loan due 2022 is the earliest maturity, followed by its US$1.15 billion senior secured notes due 2024 and
US$1.5 billion senior notes due 2026.
The company's revolving US$1 billion asset-based loan (ABL) matures in 2024; of this amount, US$761 million was
available at June 30, 2019 (with limited amounts currently drawn). Borrowing capacity under the ABL will increase to
US$1.5 billion on the earlier of the Aleris acquisition closing and Oct. 15, 2019. Aleris' assets will be included in the
borrowing base if the deal is completed.

Covenant Analysis
Compliance expectations
We expect the company to maintain compliance under its debt obligations. Novelis' ABL has a fixed-charge covenant
of 1.25 to 1, which comes into effect if availability declines below a minimum threshold (which will increase upon
completion of the Aleris acquisition). The company complied at June 30, 2019.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

Environmental risks for metals and mining companies are among the highest across all sectors, but we view
Novelis as less exposed relative to the broader industry mainly related to its downstream processing activities.. The
company operates numerous aluminum processing facilities that are well diversified globally. In the past several
years, recycled content has steadily increased to 61% of its production over the past 12 months, which limits
waste. Novelis' aluminum recycling facility in Germany is the largest such facility in the world, and modern by
industry standards. In our view, the company's high share of recycled content and reduced reliance on primary
aluminum for production have contributed to above-average margins relative to those of other metals processors
and distributors. Water use and worker injuries are also low, particularly relative to those at upstream mining
companies. The company has also established several targets for these environmental and social risk factors. That
said, Novelis' operations are highly energy-intensive and contribute risk exposure mainly related to greenhouse gas
emissions. We believe its levels of disclosure are sufficient from a credit profile perspective, but limited beyond
near-term objectives.

Issue Ratings - Recovery Analysis
Key analytical factors
• We assume the Aleris acquisition is not completed in our recovery analysis, as the company's future capital
structure-–namely the amount and type of long-term debt following completion of the deal–-is currently unknown.
• Our hypothetical distress scenario for Novelis assumes the company defaults in 2023 with a corresponding
balance-sheet restructuring in the U.S.
• In this scenario, we assume a significant deterioration in EBITDA from fiscal 2019 levels that is caused by a sharp
decline in shipments and operating issues that results in Novelis' inability to fund its fixed charges, and exhausts
available liquidity.
• We valued the company as a going concern using a 6x multiple (0.5x higher than that of its closest peers, based on
our view of Novelis' stronger business) of our projected emergence EBITDA (about in line with the company's
estimated interest and capital expenditures in the default year).
• Our recovery analysis assumes that, in a hypothetical default scenario, Novelis' secured ABL (which we currently
assume is not upsized to US$1.5 billion) and subsidiary level claims are fully covered.
• We estimate that secured term loan creditors benefit from a claim on 90% of the company's remaining net
enterprise value and share the 10% of Novelis' value that we estimate is unpledged (that is, subsidiary stock not
pledged to secured creditors) with unsecured creditors.
• Unsecured claims include senior unsecured notes and 100% of the company's underfunded
pension/postemployment benefit claims.
• As a result, we estimate modest (10%-30%, rounded estimate 20%) recovery and a '5' recovery rating ('B+'
issue-level rating) for Novelis' unsecured noteholders.
