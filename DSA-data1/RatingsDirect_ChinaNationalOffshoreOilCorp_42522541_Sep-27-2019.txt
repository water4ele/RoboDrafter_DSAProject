Key Risks

Dominant position in China's offshore E&P segment.

Exposure to the cyclicality of the oil and gas industry.

Increasingly diversified reserve base.

Significant capital expenditure outlays.

Satisfactory reserve life and good record of production growth.
Leverage to remain low despite rising capex.
Extremely high likelihood of extraordinary support from China's central government.

Increasingly diversified reserve base and satisfactory reserve life continue to support its dominant position.We expect
China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC) to maintain its dominant position in China's offshore oil and gas
production. The company's core exploration and production (E&P) subsidiary, CNOOC Ltd., has a dominant offshore
market position that is unlikely to be challenged. As of Dec. 31 2018, CNOOC Ltd. had proven reserves of 4.96 billion
barrels of oil equivalent (boe). Its reserve life was 10.1 years and reserve replacement ratio (RRR) was 126% in 2018.
CNOOC has also been developing its overseas projects. The Egina project in Nigeria started operations in January
2019 with 200,000 boe per day peak production, in which CNOOC has a 45% interest. CNOOC also has 25% interest
in Stabroek block in Guyana that has over 5 billion boe of recoverable resources at the end of 2018.
Benefits from gradual integration along the value chain. CNOOC has both offshore upstream resources and also
offshore oilfield services that provides a strategic match. The offshore services secure capabilities for its resources,
while its resources ensure there is enough work for its oilfield services operations. The group is also gradually
improving its vertical integration, which includes not only oilfield services, but also offshore engineering,
petrochemicals, refining and marketing, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) operations. High integration results in more
stable cash flow than pure upstream peers.
Leverage to remain low despite an increase in capital spending. The Chinese government has called for higher capital
expenditure (capex) by the three national oil companies (NOC) in domestic exploration and production (E&P) to
increase oil and gas supply and reduce dependence on oil and gas imports, which had exceeded 70% and 40% of
China's oil and gas consumption in 2018, respectively. We therefore expect CNOOC's capital expenditure to rise to
Chinese renminbi (RMB) 100 billion per year in 2019-2021, from around RMB60 billion in 2018. Although we expect

SEPTEMBER 24, 2019 3

China National Offshore Oil Corp.

CNOOC's discretionary cash flow will be negative in 2019-2021, its ratio of debt-to-EBITDA will only increase from
1.0x in 2018 to 1.2x in 2021.
Exposure to volatility of the oil and gas industry. CNOOC's profitability and cash flow are subject to the inherent
volatility in the oil and gas industry. Given that most of the company's business is oil and gas upstream, we forecast its
EBITDA to fall in 2019 and stay flat in 2020 based on our Brent oil price assumption of US$60 per barrel (bbl) for the
rest of 2019 and 2020, versus US$71 per bbl in 2018.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on CNOOC reflects the stable outlook on the sovereign credit rating on China. It also reflects
our expectation that CNOOC will maintain its dominant position in China's offshore oil and gas E&P industry for
the next 12-24 months, at least. Improving oil prices from the lows in 2015 and 2016 and the company's stringent
cost control in the past few years have resulted in ample ratings buffer.

Downside scenario
We could lower the rating on CNOOC if the company's debt-to-EBITDA ratio rises above 2.5x for a sustained
period. This could happen if oil prices drop significantly, CNOOC's operating expenses and capex surge, or the
company pursues large debt-funded acquisitions.
We could also lower the rating on CNOOC if we downgrade China.

Upside scenario
We could raise the rating on CNOOC if we upgrade China.

Our Base-Case Scenario

Assumptions

• Brent oil price to average US$60 per bbl for the rest
of 2019 and 2020, and US$55 per bbl for 2021 and
onwards, falling from US$71/bbl in 2018. This is
based on slower demand growth and rising
production especially in the U.S. However,
continued OPEC production cuts and geopolitical
events could support oil prices.

• Total oil and gas production for CNOOC's flagship
subsidiary, CNOOC Ltd., to increase by 2% to 485
million boe in 2019 and another 5% to 510 million
boe in 2020, versus 1% growth in 2018. This is in
response to the government's call for higher
production. Our forecasts are at the mid-points of
management's targets.
• All-in cost for CNOOC Ltd to grow by 4% per
annum in 2019-2020, as we believe the scope for
further material and personnel cost cutting will be
limited.
• CNOOC's EBITDA margin to decline to
24.5%-25.0% in 2019 and 2020 from 25.8% in 2018.
• Capex of RMB100 billion per annum in 2019-2020,
up from around RMB60 billion in 2018.
• Annual working capital outflow of RMB 5 billion in
2019 and 2020.
• Dividend of RMB 22 billion per annum in 2019 and
2020, same as 2018.

Base-case projections
CNOOC's revenue to decline by 9.6% in 2019 and 1.4% in 2020. The drop in revenue will be primarily driven by lower
Brent oil prices, which we estimate will fall by 13.0% in 2019 and 4.0% in 2020.
Capex will increase substantially. We expect CNOOC's annual capex to increase to RMB100 billion for the next two
years from around RMB 60 billion in 2018. That's following the government's call for higher domestic E&P capex to lift
domestic oil and gas production for energy security.
Adjusted EBITDA margin to decrease to 24.5%-25.0% in 2019 and 2020, from 25.8% in 2018. The decrease in margin
is based on our expectation of gradually softening oil prices and increasing operating costs.

Company Description
CNOOC, headquartered in Beijing, is the third-largest national oil company in China. The company is wholly owned by
the Chinese government through the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC).
CNOOC focuses on the exploration and development of crude oil and natural gas. It also has downstream operations,
including refining, marketing, and chemicals. The group operates with four major listed subsidiaries: CNOOC Ltd.,
China Oilfield Services Ltd. (COSL), China Offshore Oil Engineering Co. Ltd. (COOEC) and CNOOC Energy
Technology & Services Ltd. (CNOOC EnerTech). CNOOC is the largest offshore oilfield services provider in China.
Chart 1

Business Risk: Strong
We believe CNOOC will maintain its dominant position in China's offshore oil and gas production over the next 12-24
months. CNOOC has an increasingly diverse reserve base, a satisfactory reserve life, and a strong record of success in
exploration discoveries. Moreover, CNOOC is gradually improving its vertical integration, which includes oilfield
services, offshore engineering, petrochemicals, refining and marketing, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) operations.

CNOOC Ltd. continued to demonstrate its cost efficiency for the fifth consecutive year. Its all-in costs further declined
to US$30.39/bbl in 2018 from US$32.54/bbl in 2017. But we believe the scope for further material and personnel
cost-cutting will be limited, after the company exercised strong cost control in the past two to three years. We assume
all-in costs to grow by 4% p.a. for CNOOC Ltd. in the next two years. Other listed subsidiaries of CNOOC also
implemented effective cost-cutting measures to counter the industry downturn.
Phase two of CNOOC and Shell Petrochemicals Co. Ltd. (CSPC), a 50:50 joint venture between and CNOOC and Shell,
has commenced operations and added 1.2 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) to its existing 1.0 mtpa ethylene capacity.
CSPC is highly integrated with the adjacent CNOOC's Huizhou refinery. CNOOC and Shell had also signed a
memorandum of understanding in October 2018 to build an integrated petrochemical site in Huizhou. We see these
moves as CNOOC's endeavors to expand in the downstream segment. The Huizhou plant benefits from its location in
the affluent and high demand Guangdong province, and from its new equipment and technology.
CNOOC has also tapped into the new energy segment. The latest move has seen its oilfield services subsidiary, COSL,
obtaining the offshore wind projects of State Power Investment Corp. Ltd. This can leverage COSL's expertise in
offshore oilfield services and benefit its drilling and geophysical segments. However we see this as a long-term
initiative and do not expect significant cash flow contribution in the next five years.

We have selected China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC) and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (Sinopec) as
CNOOC's domestic peers, and Royal Dutch Shell PLC (Shell) and BP PLC (BP) as its international peers. All these
companies operate in the same industry and have similar business dynamics.
CNPC, Shell, and BP have a stronger business position than CNOOC given their much larger oil and gas reserve base.
They each have around 20 billion boe of oil and gas reserves while CNOOC Ltd. has 5 billion boe. In addition, they
have a larger downstream operations than CNOOC. Although CNOOC has been expanding its downstream segments,
it remains primarily an E&P player.
CNOOC's financial position is at par with that of the other two Chinese national oil companies and Shell, and better
than BP's. Most of the international oil companies have been cutting both capex and operating expenses aggressively
during the 2015-16 oil price downturn. Among its peers, CNOOC has been more stringent and its all-in cost has
decreased for the five consecutive years up to 2018. BP's financial position was constrained by the large sum it paid in
compensation after the oil spill in its Macondo project in the Gulf of Mexico.
All the three national oil companies--CNPC, Sinopec and CNOOC-- are government-related entities as they are 100%
owned by the Chinese central government. BP and Shell are publicly traded private companies and do not receive
government support. We assess that CNPC, Sinopec and CNOOC all have extremely high likelihood of receiving
extraordinary government support. This is because oil and gas are strategic reserves of China and these three
companies are the only national oil companies with a dominant position in the whole oil and gas value chain. Both
CNOOC and Sinopec are receiving a one-notch uplift from government support, while CNPC's issuer credit rating is
constrained by China's sovereign rating given its 'aa-' stand-alone credit profile.

Financial Risk: Modest
CNOOC's strong cash flows and robust balance sheet with a strong cash balance underpin its financial position.
However, the company's high capex plan and the capital-intensive nature of the oil and gas industry are constraining
CNOOC's financial risk profile, in our view.
Despite increasing capex in 2019-2021, we expect CNOOC's free operating cash flow will remain positive. However as
we expect the company to maintain its annual dividend payment of RMB22 billion p.a., we forecast CNOOC's
discretionary cash flow will be negative in 2019-2021. Hence its leverage will rise during the period. However, we
expect its ratio of debt-to-EBITDA will remain below 1.5x by 2021, way below our downside trigger of 2.5x.
Due to the inherent volatility of the oil and gas industry and CNOOC's large exposure to E&P, we have applied a
one-notch volatility adjustment in our assessment of the company's financial risk profile.
We believe CNOOC's financial risk profile is at the higher end of the intermediate category, given the company's low
debt-to-EBITDA ratio and very strong interest coverage. Therefore we applied a positive comparable rating analysis.

Liquidity: Strong
We assess CNOOC Group's liquidity as strong because the ratio of liquidity sources to liquidity uses is 1.8x-2.0x for the
24 months ending June 30, 2021. Net liquidity sources will remain positive even if EBITDA declines by 30% from our
base-case assumption.
CNOOC Group's operating cash flow will likely remain strong based on stringent cost control by CNOOC Ltd. In
addition, CNOOC Group's cash levels have been rising in the past two to three years due to a scale-back in capex,
leading to positive free cash flow.
CNOOC Group's high standing in credit markets and solid relationships with banks also provide significant buffer in its
financing capacity. As of June 30, 2019, CNOOC Ltd. has unutilized banking facilities of RMB50.7 billion.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Cash and equivalents of RMB221 billion as of June
30, 2019.

• Debt maturities of about RMB64 billion in the 12

• FFO of about RMB122 billion in the 12 months

• Working capital outflow of RMB5 billion in the
period.
• Capex of RMB100 billion in the period.
• Dividend payment of RMB22 billion in the same
period.

Covenant Analysis
CNOOC does not have any major financial covenants in its bank loans and other borrowings.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

We consider environmental factors to be key for CNOOC as an oil and gas company. As one of the three national
oil companies of China, CNOOC has to meet environmental protection targets set by the government. CNOOC
considers ESG to be a high priority for its operations. All new projects have to go through environmental and social
impact assessments. The company invested RMB350 million in emissions reduction projects in 2017. Emissions of
major pollutants all fell in 2017 from a year earlier.
CNOOC has experienced no major environmental issues in the past five years. The last major oil spill happened at
its Penglai 19-3 oilfield in Bohai Bay in June 2011. ConocoPhillips (COP) was the operator of the field, and the
reason for the oil spill was the COP violated the overall development plan. However, CNOOC paid RMB480
million for the protection of Bohai Bay.
CNOOC is also involved the offshore wind power industry. It began work on a project in Jiangsu Province in
January 2019. We believe this initiative is still in the early stages and its impact on the company's creditworthiness
will be limited in the next three to five years.

Government Influence
CNOOC is one of three wholly government-owned oil companies in China. Our view of an extremely high likelihood of
extraordinary government support for the company is based on our assessment of the following factors:
• CNOOC's critical role for the government. CNOOC is the dominant oil and gas exploration and production player in
offshore China. The company plays a key role in helping the government ensure a secure supply of energy to meet
growing domestic demand. The very limited private ownership in the oil and gas industry in China solidifies this
critical role.
• CNOOC's very strong link to the government. The Chinese government directly owns 100% of the company
through the State#owned Assets Supervision and Administration, which also monitors the company's performance.
The government is unlikely to dilute its ownership over the next five years. In our view, the government can exert a

strong influence on the company through the appointment of senior management.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
As of Dec. 31, 2018, CNOOC's capital structure consists of about RMB280 billion of senior unsecured debt and
RMB1.4 billion of secured debt. Of this, RMB257 billion is issued at the subsidiary level. CNOOC Ltd. guarantees most
of the subsidiary debt.

Analytical conclusions
We rate the senior unsecured debt that CNOOC entities issued 'A+', which is the same as our long-term issuer credit
rating on CNOOC. Although the priority debt exceeds our threshold of 50% of consolidated total debt, we do not view
subordination risk to be material, given the extremely high likelihood of extraordinary government support. We believe
the government is willing and able to intervene so that structurally subordinated lenders would not have poorer
recovery prospects than structurally senior lenders in case of financial distress.
