Well-established marketing and distribution network in China.

Inherent cyclical and capital-intensive nature of the oil and gas industry.

Dominant market position with diverse assets and revenue streams. Significant capital expenditure leading to weaker free cash flows.
Large and highly integrated operations.
Robust financial performance.

China Petrochemical Corp.'s (Sinopec Group) well-integrated operations provides a competitive advantage. The
company has business operations along the entire oil and gas value chain. It is highly integrated, with upstream,
refining, marketing, chemical, oilfield services, and oilfield engineering businesses. This results in more stable cash
flow compared with pure upstream peers. Sinopec Group is China's largest refiner and owns the largest gas station
network in the country.
Higher capital expenditure (capex) results in weaker free operating cash flow. The Chinese government has called for
higher capex by the three national oil companies (NOCs) in domestic exploration and production (E&P). As a result we
expect Sinopec Group's capex to increase in 2019 and remain high over the next two years. Given that the capex will
take time to translate into operating cash flow, we forecast the company's free cash flow will be lower in 2019 and
2020.
Sinopec Group is sensitive to inherent industry cyclicality. The company's profitability and cash flow are subject to the
inherent volatility in the oil and gas industry. We expect oil prices to decline in 2019 and 2020, which will lead to lower
profit and cash flow.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on Sinopec Group reflects the outlook on the sovereign credit rating on China. It also reflects
the extremely high likelihood of extraordinary government support from the Chinese government to Sinopec
Group, given its strategic position as one of the largest NOCs in China. At the same time, we expect Sinopec
Group's financial performance to remain stable, given its integrated operations.
The rating on Sinopec Century Bright Capital Investment Ltd. (SCB) will move in tandem with that on parent
Sinopec Group, unless SCB's group status changes.

Downside scenario
We will downgrade Sinopec Group if we lower the sovereign credit rating. We could also downgrade Sinopec
Group if its ratio of debt to EBITDA rises to above 2.5x, possibly due to: (1) higher capex than we expect or large
debt-funded acquisitions; (2) very low oil prices leading to substantial losses in the upstream and oilfield services
businesses; or (3) a significant increase in oil prices in a short period leading to meaningful losses in the refining
business.
We could lower the rating on SCB if we lower our assessment of the company's group status, or we downgrade
Sinopec Group.

Upside scenario
We will upgrade Sinopec Group to stable if we raise the sovereign credit rating.
We could raise the rating on SCB if we raise our assessment of its group status, or we upgrade Sinopec Group.

Assumptions

• Brent oil price per barrel to average US$60 for the
rest of 2019 and in 2020, and US$55 in 2021, down
from US$71 in 2018.
• Sinopec Group's revenue to decline by 3%-5% in
2019-2020, given our oil price assumptions.
• Capex of about Chinese renminbi (RMB) 140 billion
each year in 2019 and 2020 in view of the higher
capex guidance by Sinopec Corp., Sinopec Group's
flagship subsidiary.

• Sinopec Corp.'s oil production to fall by 0.5% per
year in 2019 and 2020, from 289 million barrels in
2018. Gas production to grow by 4.5% in 2019 and
4.0% in 2020, from 977 billion cubic feet in 2018. We
expect faster growth for natural gas owing to
constraints in Sinopec Corp.'s oil reserves and the
company's plan to ramp up its gas production,
especially in the Sichuan basin.
• Sinopec Corp.'s refinery throughput to grow by 1.0%
per annum in 2019 and 2020 from 244 million tons
in 2018. This is at a weaker pace than in prior years
mainly because of China's slowing demand growth
for oil products.
• Sinopec Corp.'s gross refining margin to fall to US$9
per barrel in 2019 and 2020, from US$9.49 per barrel
in 2018, due to falling oil prices and rising supply
versus demand. We have not factored in any
potential positive impact from the implementation of
the International Maritime Organization's new sulfur
restriction on marine fuel from 2020.
• Sinopec Group's EBITDA margin to fall to
7.0%-8.0% in 2019 and 2020, from 8.3% in 2018, due
to our assumptions of falling oil prices.
• The company's overall EBITDA to be RMB210
billion-RMB220 billion in 2019 and 2020, lower than
RMB244 billion in 2018, mainly because lower oil
prices will hurt the E&P segment.

Base-case projections
Sinopec Group's revenue to decline by 5% in 2019. The drop in revenue will be driven by lower Brent oil prices, which
we estimate will fall by 12.3% in 2019 and 4.8% in 2020.

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 24, 2019 4

Adjusted EBITDA margins to decrease to 8% in 2019 and 2020, from 8.3% in 2018. We expect margins to drop slightly
over the next 12-24 months, primarily due to our assumptions of lower oil prices.
Capex will increase substantially. We expect Sinopec Group's annual capex to increase to RMB140 billion over the
next two years, from RMB110 billion in 2018. That is in response to the Chinese government's call for higher E&P
capex to lift domestic oil and gas production for energy security.

Company Description
Sinopec Group is a national oil company in China and is 100% owned by China's State-owned Assets Supervision and
Administration Commission (SASAC). It is also one of the largest integrated oil and gas companies in the world.
Sinopec Group operates in six business segments: oil and gas E&P, refining, chemicals, marketing, engineering
technical services, and trading.

Business Risk: Strong
Sinopec Group's large and well-integrated operations with diverse assets and revenue streams, dominant market
position in the downstream segment, and well-established marketing and distribution network in China underpin its
strong business position. However, these benefits are partially offset by the inherent cyclical risk in the oil and gas
industry, where performance is closely linked to fluctuations in crude oil prices.
We expect the proportion of natural gas to continue to increase in Sinopec Group's production mix. Being one of
China's three NOCs and the largest downstream operator, Sinopec Group contributes to about 40% of the total crude
oil processed in the country.
However, the company's own crude oil production can only meet less than one-fifth of its refining capacity. Therefore,
over the past few years, the company has increased its investments in the upstream segment, mainly in cleaner natural
gas, adhering to China's national goal of increasing cleaner sources of energy compared to crude oil.
We expect Sinopec Group to maintain its dominant position in China's refining and marketing segment, given its large
scale and geographically diversified operations within China. Although teapot refineries have been expanding since the

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 24, 2019 6

China Petrochemical Corp.

government granted crude oil import rights in mid-2015, Sinopec Group's cost advantage arising from its scale and
integration with its downstream gas station network supports its business strength.
China's Ministry of Commerce removed restrictions on foreign ownership in gas station operators with more than 30
stations in mid-2018. Since then, a number of foreign companies, including BP PLC, have announced plans to open gas
stations in China. This could increase competition in the long run. However, it is unlikely to change the landscape in
the short term, given the time and capital needed to build such distribution networks. Moreover, Sinopec Group
already occupies the best locations. That said, foreign-owned gas stations are generally more efficient and offer better
customer experience. We believe Sinopec Group is striving to improve on these fronts.
The government also announced plans to form a national oil and gas pipeline company group this year. However, we
do not expect this to have a significant impact on Sinopec Group. First, pipeline assets only account for a small portion
of Sinopec Group's assets or cash flow. Second, the gearing of some pipeline-related subsidiaries is similar to that of
Sinopec Group's, based on available information. We believe a national pipeline company may benefit Sinopec Group's
natural gas sales, given that gas pipelines are currently dominated by its peer China National Petroleum Corp.

We have selected the other two Chinese NOCs, China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC) and China National Offshore
Oil Corp. (CNOOC), as Sinopec Group's domestic peers. We have also selected international oil companies such as BP
PLC, Exxon Mobil Corp., and Royal Dutch Shell PLC as the global peers of Sinopec Group.
In our view, Sinopec Group's business position is comparable to CNOOC's, but weaker than that of CNPC and other
global peers. This is because Sinopec Group has a smaller reserve base and a shorter reserve life. Sinopec Corp.'s total
oil and gas reserve was 2.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe), smaller than CNOOC's 5.0 billion boe and PetroChina
Co. Ltd.'s (CNPC's flagship subsidiary) 20.8 billion. Sinopec Corp.'s reserve life as of 2018 was 5.9 years, lower than
PetroChina's 13.7 years and CNOOC's 10.5 years.
Sinopec Group's financial position is on par with the other two Chinese NOCs and comparable with the other
international oil companies. To manage costs, major oil companies have been actively cutting capex and operating
expenses in response to falling oil prices.
All the three NOCs--CNPC, Sinopec Group, and CNOOC--are government-related entities as they are 100% owned by
the Chinese central government. BP and Shell are publicly traded private companies and do not receive government
support. We assess CNPC, Sinopec Group, and CNOOC as having extremely high likelihood of receiving extraordinary
government support. This is because oil and gas are strategic reserves and these three companies are the only NOCs
with a dominant position in the oil and gas value chain. We apply a one-notch uplift to both CNOOC and Sinopec
Group in view of potential government support, while CNPC's issuer credit rating is constrained by the sovereign
credit rating on China given its 'aa-' stand-alone credit profile.

Financial Risk: Intermediate
In our view, Sinopec Group will maintain its robust financial strength over the next 12-24 months. We expect its
debt-to-EBITDA ratio to be stable at about 2x despite high capex. We believe free cash flow will remain positive but
discretionary cash flow after dividend will be negative, thereby raising leverage.
We expect Sinopec Group to increase its capex to about RMB140 billion in 2019 and 2020, from RMB110 billion in
2018. The management aims to allocate most of its total capex to the E&P segment, given the government's request to
raise domestic exploration.
We believe Sinopec Group's financial risk profile is at the higher end of the intermediate category. We reflect this
relative strength in our positive comparable rating analysis.

Liquidity: Adequate
We assess Sinopec Group's liquidity as adequate. We expect the company's liquidity sources to cover uses by 1.3x
over the 12 months ending March 31, 2020, and liquidity sources to exceed uses even if EBITDA declines by 15%. We
expect the group to retain its very good access to banks and debt capital markets.
As of June 30, 2019, Sinopec Corp. had total banking facilities of RMB388 billion. Only RMB24 billion was used, while
RMB364 billion remains unused, demonstrating strong support from banks.
In addition, Sinopec Group had about RMB168 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2019. We believe
the company is able to absorb high-impact, low-probability events.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Cash and cash equivalents of about RMB168 billion
as of March 31, 2019.

• Short-term debt maturities of about RMB73 billion
due in the 12 months ending March 31, 2020.

• Cash from operations that we forecast at about
RMB160 billion in the 12 months ending March 31,
2020.

• Working capital outflow of RMB5 billion during that
time.
• Capex of RMB136 billion in the same period.
• Projected dividend payments of about RMB52
billion over the same period.

Covenant Analysis
Sinopec Group does not have any major financial covenants in its bank loans and other borrowings.

Government Influence
We see an extremely high likelihood of extraordinary support from the Chinese government to Sinopec Group. Our
view is based on the following assessments:
• Critical role to the government: Sinopec Group plays a key role in ensuring a secured supply of energy to meet
growing domestic demand. Limited private ownership in the oil and gas industry in China solidifies the company's
critical role.
• Very strong link with the government: The Chinese government owns 100% of Sinopec Group through the SASAC.
We believe the government is able to exert a strong influence on the company's strategy through the appointment
of its senior executives and constant surveillance.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
As of Dec. 31, 2018, Sinopec Group's capital structure consisted of about RMB635 billion in unsecured debt, with
about RMB358 billion in senior unsecured debt at its subsidiaries.

Analytical conclusions
We rate the senior unsecured debt issued by Sinopec Group the same as our long-term issuer credit rating on the
company. Although the priority debt exceeds our threshold of 50% of total consolidated debt, we do not believe the
company's capital structure constitutes material subordination risk because of the extremely high likelihood of
extraordinary government support. We believe the government is willing and able to intervene so that structurally
subordinated lenders would not have poorer recovery prospects than structurally senior lenders in case of financial
distress.
