Key Risks

Strong brand recognition in Zhejiang province.

High leverage stemming from aggressive growth appetite.

Access to diverse and low-cost funding channels due to parent
support.

Short record of consistent financial management.

Greentown China Holdings Ltd. should maintain its good brand recognition in Zhejiang and other higher-tier cities,
thanks to its high-quality products. Its premium product offerings have helped the company to build barriers to entry in
the competitive property industry in Zhejiang, its home market. The developer also benefits from a long operating
history of more than 24 years in Hangzhou and Zhejiang provinces and good bargaining power among local customers
due to its high-quality products. As of June 30, 2019, about 40% of Greentown's total land reserves were in Zhejiang.
We expect a good sell-through rate for these reserve projects, following a satisfactory sales record over the past years.
In addition, we believe Greentown's substantial presence in higher-tier cities fit its strategy of offering premium
products. Purchasing power in first- and second-tier cities is higher than lower-tier cities, supported by rising
household income and solid population growth. Land reserves in first- and second-tier cities accounted for 72% of the
company's total saleable value at end-June 2019.

The longer development cycle and higher construction costs will continue to strain profitability and turnover.
Greentown's development cycle is generally longer than peers with a fast-churn model due to its focus on large-scale,
high-end projects, such as integrated community projects and national game parks. The company's return on capital
(ROC) of 8.9% in 2018 and 6.1% in 2017 was lower than that of peers of similar scale. We believe Greentown's
business model puts pressure on its short-term cash flow and leverage, although it brings longer-term benefits
especially in acquiring a large and quality land bank. We believe working capital management will remain the key
driver of the company's operating performance over the next one to two years.
Greentown's margins are unlikely to improve significantly despite increasing in the first half. We expect housing
purchase restrictions to remain in higher-tier cities. Most of the company's key markets, such as Hangzhou, Beijing,
and Tianjin, still have policy controls on new house prices. This will likely limit the upside in its average selling price
(ASP) amid high construction and administrative costs.
Aggressive growth appetite will keep leverage elevated in 2019. Greentown targets sales of Chinese renminbi (RMB)
200 billion in 2019 and RMB300 billion by 2021 (including contracted sales generated by the asset-light property
management business). As a result, we expect the company to spend aggressively on land acquisition to support
growth.

Lower funding cost and diverse funding channels should moderate the impact of high debt. Greentown's average
funding cost of 5.4% in 2018 and the first half of 2019 is lower than the industry average. We believe this is attributable
to ongoing support from the company's parent, China Communications Construction Group (CCCG), for example,
through sharing the group's credit lines. Greentown's financing channels were broadened and bank relationships
enhanced after CCCG became its largest shareholder.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on Greentown reflects our expectation that the company's leverage will remain high over the
next 12 months as Greentown continues its steady growth. We estimate the company's debt-to-EBITDA ratio, on a
proportionately consolidated basis, to be 9x-10x during this time.
The outlook also factors in our expectation that CCCG will continue to provide ongoing support to Greentown.

Downside scenario
We may lower the rating if Greentown's business expansion is more aggressive than we expect without an
accompanying growth in property sales, such that its financial leverage weakens. Consolidated EBITDA interest
coverage dropping below 1.5x or ratio of debt to EBITDA on a proportionately consolidated basis significantly
weakening from about 9x over the next 12 months would indicate such deterioration.
We could also lower the rating if our assessment of support for Greentown from CCCG weakens.

Upside scenario
We may raise the rating if: (1) CCCG's support to Greentown strengthens and the group's credit profile remains
stable; and (2) Greentown has a better record of integrated operations and financial management with the group.
In a less likely scenario, we may raise our assessment of Greentown's stand-alone credit profile if the company
demonstrates more prudent financial management and has a clear deleveraging plan. An upgrade trigger could be
EBITDA interest coverage improving to more than 2.5x on a sustainable basis.

Our Base-Case Scenario

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 5, 2019 5

Greentown China Holdings Ltd.

Assumptions

• China's property residential sales to increase by
12%-15% in 2019, which is likely driven by a 2%-3%
growth in gross floor area and a 10%-12% rise in
ASP. Greentown's sales growth will outpace the
industry average, underpinned by the company's
project launch schedule.
• Greentown's total contracted sales will grow to
RMB180 billion-RMB200 billion in 2019, from
RMB156.4 billion in 2018. This includes RMB60
billion from asset-light projects in both years.

• The company's attributable ratio to remain at about
60% of its total contracted sales (excluding
asset-light projects) in 2019-2020.
• Its land premiums to remain high at RMB50
million-RMB60 billion (on an attributable basis) in
2019, about 50%-60% of attributable contracted
sales.
• Adjusted debt will increase to RMB135
billion-RMB145 billion in 2019 and RMB160
billion-RMB140 billion in 2020, from RMB119.5
billion in 2018.
• Cash balance to be about RMB40 billion in 2019 and
2020.
• Acquisitions of RMB1 billion-RMB2 billion for
business diversification each one in the next one to
two years.

Base-case projections
Revenue to grow by 10% to RMB66 billion in 2019 and RMB71 billion in 2020. Greentown had satisfactory revenue
growth of 43.7% in 2018 from 2017, driven by completion of large projects such as Tianjin National Games Village.
However, we expect the growth to moderate over the next two years, tracking the modest sales growth of its
consolidated projects.
Volume expansion, rather than ASP, will fuel revenue growth. The company's ASP will likely remain capped given
many of its higher-end products are already near the price ceiling in the higher-tier cities with ongoing policy
restrictions. Despite the restrictions, Greentown is unlikely to significantly diversify its geographic exposure to
lower-tier cities. That's given its strategic focus on high-end products and target segment of higher-income customers.
EBITDA margin to stabilize at 20%-22%, compared with 20.5% in 2018. We see limited upside for Greentown's profit
margin, given the selling price controls in its key operating cities, against its high construction and administrative
expenditure across its projects.

Greentown China Holdings Ltd.

Company Description
Registered in Cayman Island, Greentown is a holding company that mainly engages in residential property
development in China. The company focuses on the mid-to-high end-market, and its offerings include high-rise
apartments and villas. Since its establishment 20 years ago, Greentown has been based in Zhejiang province. In May
2015, CCCG became the biggest shareholder of Greentown.

Business Risk: Fair
Greentown will likely maintain its large operating scale, high-quality product offering, and strong market position in its
home market Zhejiang over the next 12-24 months. The company is gradually establishing its market position in other
tier-one and tier-two cities.
Greentown's cost control and working capital management is weaker than that of similar-rated peers. That's mainly
due to the company's long development cycle and heavy capital required for its large-scale and high-end products,
such as integrated communities and villas. Greentown intends to shift its focus to more fast-churn development
projects. However, given the short track record of operating a different model, the results of such change will take time
to be seen.
Use of joint ventures (JVs) will partly mitigate Greentown's risk of operating in competitive higher-tier markets
because the partners share the financial burden of high land costs. Greentown's JV projects are likely to continue to
contribute about 40% of the company's contracted sales in the next 24 months.
In our view, Greentown's cooperation with CCCG will increase its bargaining power in acquiring new land reserves,
given CCCG's position as the top infrastructure operator in China and status as a central state-owned enterprise (SOE).
In September 2018, Greentown signed framework agreements with CCCG to co-develop 16 projects with investment
value of over RMB250 billion.
Greentown's asset-light projects help the company to increase its scale without significantly stretching its balance
sheet, given that Greentown does not carry inventory for these projects. The income is on a management fee-based
structure as the company provides professional and management services. As of end-2018, the company has a total of
282 construction management projects in its portfolio. In the year, Greentown recognized RMB1.4 billion in revenue
from project management fees, compared with RMB0.9 billion in 2017. We attribute the increase to the company's
good brand name in Zhejiang and its proven execution capability. That said, Greentown's focus on asset-heavy
projects will continue, and asset-light projects' contribution to the company's earnings will be much smaller than its
development business.

We consider Yanlord Land Group Ltd., KWG Group Holdings Ltd., and Sunac China Holdings Ltd. to be Greentown's
close peers because they all focus on the mid-to-high-end residential property segment. They also have comparable
business and product offerings, and moderate geographical diversification.
Greentown has stronger brand image and larger business scale than KWG and Yanlord, but it has higher geographic
concentration. Greentown's operating scale is smaller than that of Sunac, which has increased its market position
substantially over the past three years.
Greentown's EBITDA margin is lower than peers'. This reflects the company's weaker cost controls and the effects of
strict housing price controls in the cities in which it operates.

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 5, 2019 8

Greentown China Holdings Ltd.

Greentown's financial leverage is weaker than its peers', except for KWG. After proportionate consolidation of JV
projects, KWG's debt-to-EBITDA ratio was about 10.3x in 2018, similar to Greentown's. We attribute Greentown's high
leverage to its aggressive expansion in the past two to three years. The company substantially increased its borrowings
for land acquisitions during this time as it focused on tier-one and tier-two cities with rising land costs. We expect
Greentown's land acquisition to remain high over the next one to two years to support its growth aspirations.
Greentown is the only company with parent support. We believe the parent support will benefit the company to
acquire quality land and co-develop projects, and help it to get access to diversified funding channels.

Financial Risk: Highly leveraged
We expect Greentown's leverage to remain elevated over the next two years due to the company's aggressive growth
appetite. In 2018, the company acquired land worth RMB52 billion (RMB34 billion on an attributable basis), which was
50%-60% of its contracted sales. We expect such high investment to continue over the next two years to support sales
growth.
We estimate that Greentown's adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio on a proportionately consolidated basis will stay at
9x-10x in the next two years, compared with about 9x in 2018. Greentown's debt-to-EBITDA ratio after consolidating
the JVs' debt and EBITDA will be lower, because Greentown and its JV partners usually use internal resources to
acquire land plots and inject them into JV companies for equity stakes. JV companies only obtain construction
financing using the land as collateral, therefore, leverage at the JV level is generally lower.
Greentown receives ongoing financial support from CCCG, including shared credit lines and improved banking
relationships, resulting in its lower funding costs. CCCG is also willing to subscribe to Greentown's bond issuance, thus
enabling Greentown to achieve its targeted fundraising. We reflect these strengths in our positive comparable rating
analysis.

Liquidity: Adequate
In our view, Greentown has adequate liquidity. We estimate the company's liquidity sources will exceed uses by more
than 2x over the 12 months ending June 2020.
However, we believe Greentown is not likely to be able to absorb high-impact, low-probability events without
refinancing, because of its high borrowings and its operations in a cyclical property industry in China. Therefore, we do
not assess its liquidity as strong.
Greentown has diversified funding channels in both onshore and offshore markets. Apart from corporate bonds,
asset-backed securities, and commercial papers, the company also has a track record of issuing unsecured syndicated
loans and bilateral loans in the offshore capital market with low funding costs and long maturity. In the first half of
2019, the company issued a total of RMB10.6 billion onshore bonds with an average interest cost of 4.87%, lower than
the industry average.
Under stressed conditions, Greentown could also reduce land acquisition and slow construction to preserve liquidity.
Therefore, we only include the committed portion of the land premium in its liquidity use.
Greentown's banking facilities and bond documents include certain financial covenants. We believe the company has
sufficient headroom to comply with the covenants. In our base case, we expect the company to meet its financial
covenant requirements over the next 12 months.

Group Influence
We assess Greentown to be a moderately strategic subsidiary of CCCG, which is the largest shareholder with 28.81%
stake in the company. CCCG is well represented on Greentown's board of directors, accounting for four out of the six
board members, and senior management (including the CEO). CCCG also has a track record of providing operational
support to Greentown, including by entering into strategic partnerships for land acquisitions.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
As of Dec. 31, 2018, Greentown's capital structure consists of RMB30 billion in secured debt and RMB51.4 billion in
unsecured debt. Of this, RMB37.7 billion is unsecured debt at the subsidiary level. The priority debt ratio is 83.2%,
higher than our threshold of 50% for notching down the issue rating.

Analytical conclusions
We rate Greentown's debt 'B+', one notch lower than the issuer credit rating, given significant subordination risks in
the capital structure.
