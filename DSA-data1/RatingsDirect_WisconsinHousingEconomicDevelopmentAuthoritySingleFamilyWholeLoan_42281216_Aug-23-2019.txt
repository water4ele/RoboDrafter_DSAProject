Rationale
S&P Global Ratings revised the outlook to positive from stable and affirmed its 'AA', 'AA/A-1+', and 'AA/A-1' ratings
on the Wisconsin Housing & Economic Development Authority's (WHEDA) existing debt, issued under the authority's
1987 single-family parity indenture. At the same time, S&P Global Ratings assigned its 'AA' rating, and positive
outlook, to WHEDA's series 2019C homeownership revenue bonds, issued under the 1987 indenture.
The rating reflects our opinion of the authority's:
• Improved asset quality of its single-family mortgage portfolio, with more mortgage-backed security (MBS) after the
new issuance;
• Very strong coverage of projected credit shortfalls through its $122 million in excess assets within the parity
resolution, with an adjusted asset-to-liability parity of 126%; and
• Strong asset and administrative management oversight WHEDA provides in relation to its mortgage portfolio.
Partially offsetting these strengths, in our view, is some exposure to variable-rate demand obligations (VRDOs). We
believe the strength of cash flow mitigates contingent liquidity and swap dependable risks (89% hedged). VRDOs
exposure will diminish to 22% from 29% after the new issuance. Preliminary offering documents indicate the series
2019C bond proceeds will purchase MBS backed by pools of mortgage loans, and to make a deposit in the debt service
reserve fund (DSRF).

Outlook
The positive outlook reflects our view that WHEDA will likely continue to provide a high degree of security to
bondholders by:
• Building the resolution's financial strength with improved asset quality, increasing MBS;
• Sustaining overall growth in its asset-to-liability parity ratio to consistently cover loan losses and our stress

assumptions; and
• Maintaining strong administrative oversight and mortgage-loan collateral performance.

Upside scenario
We believe the following scenarios could lead to a positive rating action:
• An improved loan quality that has a significant positive effect on loss coverage;
• Less exposure to variable-rate debt; or
• An improvement in excess assets to cover potential liquidity and credit shortfalls under various prepayment
scenarios in line with the 'AA' rating level.

Downside scenario
Conversely, we believe the following scenarios could lead to a negative rating action:
• An increase in delinquencies that significantly affects loss coverage;
• Weakening cash flows due to heavy use of variable-rate debt (unhedged);
• An inability to demonstrate sufficient excess assets to cover potential liquidity and credit shortfalls under various
prepayment scenarios in line with a 'AA' rating; or
• A significant deterioration of loan performance that affects reserves.

Cash Flows
Consolidated cash flows provided to us incorporate various rating agency assumptions, reflecting current market
conditions. These conditions include increased liquidity costs, basis risk, and swap counterparty risk. Cash flows also
incorporate our interest-rate assumptions for variable-rate bonds.
Based on loan information as of March 31, 2019, we project $8.7 million in potential loan losses for the loans
outstanding, factoring in our loan-loss criteria that includes losses on WHEDA's subordinate-lien down payment
assistance (DPA) loans, which represent less than 2% of the portfolio.
The beginning asset-to-liability parity ratio was 128.7% at June 30, 2018, with approximately $122 million in net
assets. When factoring total credit losses, using the lowest parity position, the adjusted asset-to-liability ratio is
126.13%. Excess assets available under the resolution cover potential shortfalls. Under all prepayment scenarios,
sufficient excess assets and revenue are available to make timely debt-service payments plus fees.

Asset Quality
The mortgage portfolio had approximately 4,199 whole loans and 1,440 loans tied to DPA with an aggregate principal
balance of $164 million outstanding in whole loan (including $4.96 million of DPA) and 86 MBS investments, totaling
$265 million, under the resolution at March. 31, 2019. After this issuance, the resolution becomes predominantly MBS
(69%).

Nineteen percent of whole loans outstanding are insured by a series of private mortgage insurance companies (PMIs),
including Genworth, United Guaranty, PMI Mortgage Insurance Co. Of the providers insuring loans in the indenture,
53% of PMIs are rated at an investment-grade level, which results in some credit for claims (26% recovery). The
remaining 81% of whole loans outstanding are not required to carry insurance because their original loan-to-value
(LTV) ratio was less than 80%. In addition, the majority of its loan portfolio has LTV ratios of less than 80% on
average. All loans in the portfolio have 30-year terms with a fixed-interest rate base. WHEDA does not have any
interest-only or step-up loans in its portfolio, and there are a small percentage of second loans representing less than
2% of the mortgage portfolio.
We believe low LTV levels, increasing high-quality MBS, and the resolution's sufficient excess assets and reserves to
cover projected loan losses mitigate the effects of the PMIs' credit quality. Furthermore, WHEDA works with
borrowers to reduce delinquencies and foreclosures by offering loan modifications and extensions.

Debt Type And Swaps
At June 30, 2019, WHEDA had $385.9 million in bonds outstanding. Of the total debt, 71% is fixed-rate debt; 88% of
variable rate debt is hedged. Liquidity in the form of a standby bond purchase agreement for the resolution's
variable-rate obligations is provided by:
• BMO Harris Bank N.A.;
• Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago; and
• Royal Bank of Canada.
The use of variable-rate debt exposes WHEDA to fluctuating interest rates, so it entered into a series of interest-rate
swaps to hedge floating-rate exposure on variable-rate bonds.
WHEDA's swaps are with JPMorgan Chase Bank and Royal Bank of Canada. Management has a written
swap-management plan, and it performs periodic swap reviews and valuations and discloses swap information in its
annual audit. Furthermore, because its bond issues are swap dependent, risks and expenses associated with swaps,
liquidity, and VRDOs are incorporated into the cash flows we received from WHEDA. We believe the strength of cash
flows mitigates those risks.

Reserves And Investments
Liquidity coverage for mortgages is provided by a DSRF sized at 2% of bonds outstanding under the resolution. This
reserve will be invested in an investment rated as high as the rating on the bonds. All funds under the indenture will be
held in commensurate investments through bond maturity. Investment agreements account for approximately 2% of
WHEDA's investments under its 1987 indenture.
