Weak and volatile free cash flow generation due weak margin
profile and high restructuring needs.

Ongoing negative free cash flow weighs on ratings with planned IPO expected to provide uplift to credit ratios. S&P
Global Ratings forecasts thyssenkrupp AG's funds from operations (FFO)-to-debt in 2020 will be about 15%, despite
the planned partial IPO of its elevator technology division, due to the ongoing negative free cash flow and weak
market conditions. We view adjusted FFO-to-debt of 12%-16% to be in line with a 'BB-' long-term issuer credit rating,
and 16%-20% with a 'BB' rating, given thyssenkrupp's business mix.
Free cash flow for the first nine months of fiscal year 2018-2019 was significantly negative at €2.5 billion (compared
with negative €1.6 billion a year earlier). The main reason for the cash outflow was decrease in net income and
increased net working capital, in particular at the materials businesses. We expect free cash flow to remain negative for
the current fiscal year at €1.1 billion and remain negative for the next fiscal year at several hundred million euros.

Despite the risks with the planned partial IPO given volatile capital market conditions, we believe thyssenkrupp will
execute the transaction, due to the attractive and stable profile of its elevator business, and therefore include the
transaction in our base-case scenario. We also understand that the group plans to use the proceeds to strengthen its
balance sheet. The preparations for the transaction are well underway, and we assume thyssenkrupp will dispose
about 20% of the elevators division's shares and continue to consolidate the new listed entity. Should the transaction
not materialize and operating performance not improve significantly, we would likely lower our ratings on the
company.
thyssenkrupp's board approved the minority IPO unanimously, but under the condition that management evaluates
offers for a disposal of the division as a whole. The group has since confirmed it will run a dual-track process for the
elevators division by simultaneously assessing offers regarding a private trade sale as an alternative for the IPO. The
division's full sale--which we consider a realistic scenario due to interest expressed both by strategic and financial
investors--would significantly weaken the remaining group's business risk profile, because the elevators division
provides more than 50% of the group's reported EBITDA.
A full sale of the division would enable the group to readjust its capital structure due to the expected sale proceeds,
which according to available estimates could amount to €13 billion-€17 billion in gross value. thyssenkrupp's debt
(S&P Global Ratings-adjusted) is expected at €12 billion at the end of the current fiscal year including net
pension-related obligations at about €7.3 billion (including our adjustments), limiting rating upside. With our forecast
of thyssenkrupp's 2020 performance excluding the elevators division's contribution to group EBITDA, the capital
structure, including pensions, would need to be reset and leverage reduced for rating stability or potential ratings
upside. However, we believe it is unlikely that the group's management and shareholders would embrace the prospect
of running the remaining business, which would have increased volatility, without adjusting accordingly. We
understand that, in case of a full sale of the elevators business, management would seek to use the proceeds to redeem

thyssenkrupp AG

debt and fund the group's pension deficit.

Outlook: Developing

The developing outlook means we could raise, lower, or affirm the ratings depending on the group's ability to
improve its operating performance and on the outcome of the planned IPO or a trade sale of the elevators
business.
In our base-case scenario, we assume that thyssenkrupp will execute the planned IPO, generating €2 billion of net
cash inflow from the transaction, as well as gaining flexibility to monetize its remaining holding on the new listed
entity in case needed. We further assume that the group will gradually improve its operating performance and
margins, which are at an all-time low, and reach modestly positive free operating cash flow (FOCF) by 2021. We
view adjusted FFO-to-debt of 12%-16% over the next 12 months as in line with a 'BB-' rating, provided the group's
operating performance starts to improve.

Downside scenario
Credit risk over the 12-month outlook horizon would likely materialize if the IPO did not proceed and the group's
operating performance did not improve according to our base-case expectations. In this case, thyssenkrupp would
not be able to offset the negative free cash flow of 2019 and 2020 with proceeds, which in light of our forecast
performance would lead to FFO-to-debt of about 12% by 2020 all else equal.
Also, should operating performance not improve, credit ratios would further weaken, which would likely hamper
the group's ability to refinance with attractive conditions, and lead to a downgrade.

Upside scenario
We see limited ratings upside potential for thyssenkrupp over the next 12 months from a purely operational
perspective, because we do not envision a fast turnaround of the business toward generating positive free cash
flow. However, because the group has communicated plans to engage in a dual-track process on its elevator
business, we view a full sale of the business as a realistic option. With available estimates of an enterprise value of
€13 billion-€17 billion, and adjusted debt at the end of 2019 at about €12 billion (including pensions and leases), a
full sale would enable the group to reset its balance sheet structure to reflect the cash flow generation capacity of
the remaining business at a desired credit risk level. For an upgrade, we would need to see FOCF turning positive,
which enables debt repayment and effective management of the capital structure.
We understand that management aims to strengthen the group's credit risk profile and that using the bulk of sales
proceed for this purpose is management's preferred option in a full-sale scenario.

Assumptions

• We expect weakening macroeconomic conditions
will continue to hamper the group's performance in
2019 and 2020. Most important, we expect weaker
demand from the auto sector will continue to
pressure the group's divisions with high auto
exposure, namely its steel, materials, and
component technologies divisions. These are the
three largest divisions of the group by topline,
together with elevators, and they are posting very
weak operating margins, which we expect to persist
through 2020.

• The elevator division will continue to display steady
low-single-digits topline growth, with potential for
margin improvement through ongoing optimization
of corporate structures and its product portfolio.
• Marine systems and industrial solutions divisions
post zero or negative operating margins. We expect
margins for both divisions will improve through
2020. In particular, industrial solutions' growing
order book should help cover fixed costs and
improve its cash flow profile.
• thyssenkrupp has placed three heavily
underperforming businesses (springs and stabilizers,
systems engineering, and heavy plates) under
strategic review, and plans to either restructure or
dispose of them. We expect this will help the group
increase operating margins and cash flow starting
from 2020.
• The topline will be stagnant, at about €41 billion
over the next two years, and EBITDA before lease
adjustments of €1.5 billion-€1.6 billion in 2019, and
€1.8 billion-€1.9 billion in 2020, including our
assumption of €400 million-€500 million of
restructuring expenses per year, leading to modest
EBITDA margins of about 4%.
• We expect negative free cash flow of around €1.1
billion for 2019 and several hundred million euros in
2020. This includes our assumption of annual capital
expenditures (capex) of about €1.5 billion, and the
payout of a steel cartel fine imposed on
thyssenkrupp and transaction-related costs and
taxes in 2020. For 2019, we expect the fourth
quarter to be strongly cash-positive, as is always the

thyssenkrupp AG

case for the company, in particular due to the
release of working capital toward the fiscal year-end.
• For base-case modelling purposes, we have included
the minority IPO with an assumption of closing
mid-2020 and net cash proceeds after IPO costs of
about €2 billion, and do not include a meaningful
change in shareholder distributions or an
extraordinary dividend over the period.

Current performance
Over the first nine months of fiscal year 2018-2019, thyssenkrupp's order intake increased 2% to €30.7 billion and sales
grew year-over-year by 1% to €31.2 billion. Increasingly weaker global economic momentum, a marked downturn in
the auto sector, and continued high import pressure for steel slowed growth. On top of this, an increase in raw material
prices, especially iron ore, negatively affected margins. These factors hindered operating earnings, particularly in the
auto components and materials businesses. Nine-month EBIT of €396 million was significantly down from the prior
year's €1.1 billion, and margins declined to 1.3% from 3.6%.
Growth in orders and sales in the first nine months was due solely to the capital goods businesses outweighing decline
in materials businesses. Elevator technology again recorded a significant increase in orders thanks to the U.S. market
that drove sales growth as well as several major projects in Asia-Pacific and Europe. Industrial solutions increased its
order intake and sales mainly in chemical plant construction, while components technology achieved growth
particularly in industrial components. At marine systems, order intake was lower but sales were significantly higher
than a year earlier. The materials services and Steel Europe businesses were affected by the overall market slowdown,
in particular due to a noticeable drop in demand from the auto industry.
Free cash flow for the first nine months of fiscal year 2018-2019 was significantly negative at €2.5 billion (compared
with negative €1.6 billion the year before). The main reason for the cash outflow was decrease in net income and
increased net working capital, in particular at the materials businesses. We expect free cash flow to remain negative for
this fiscal year at €1.1 billion and remain negative for the next fiscal year at several hundred million euros.

Company Description
thyssenkrupp is a diversified industrial conglomerate headquartered in Germany with active operation in about 80
countries worldwide. The company generates €41 billion of sales (2018-2019 forecast) and operates across six
business areas:
• Components technology
• Elevator technology
• Industrial solutions
• Marine systems

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 6, 2019 6

thyssenkrupp AG

• Materials services
• Steel Europe
thyssenkrupp has restarted the group's strategic realignment process, after the European Commission formally
prohibited the proposed merger with Tata Steel Europe on June 2019. Tata Steel and thyssenkrupp AG had agreed to
merge their European steel businesses in a 50-50 joint venture. The aim was to create a European flat steel supplier
positioned as a quality and technology leader. This followed the signing of a memorandum of understanding in
September 2017.
In May 2019, the group announced that the Tata merger has been called off due to the commission's continuing
concerns, and it will start reconsolidating its steel operations from third-quarter 2019 (the Steel Europe business was
reported as discontinued operations in the 2018 annual report). Also in May, the group announced that the planned
separation of thyssenkrupp into thyssenkrupp Industrials and thyssenkrupp Materials is no longer viable, in light of the
commission's likely decision and current negative economic momentum.
The company had announced the separation in September 2018. According to the plan, Industrials would have had
combined Elevator technology, as well as major parts of components technology and industrial solutions. The
Materials division would have held the steel joint venture with Tata Steel Europe, materials services, marine systems,
and industries (formerly part of component technology). Now, instead of the planned spin-off, the group is preparing
the elevator technology business for an IPO.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
thyssenkrupp's business risk profile reflects our view of the good visibility of revenues and margins at the elevator
technology segment, contributing a large share of the company's recurring profitability and cash flow. It also reflects
diversification of the group's business across several industrial end markets, product lines and geographies. The
group's main challenge is its weak profitability from overall low performance and high central costs.
The most important segment for the overall business risk profile is elevator technology, which we expect will
contribute more than 60% of the group's EBITDA over the forecast horizon, and has high cash conversion due to
modest capex. Compared with most business models in the capital goods sector, the elevators (€7.6 billion of sales and
a 11%-12% EBITDA margin) business model is favorable due to the underlying market growth at the level of the global
GDP growth or higher, its stability driven by global megatrends, such as urbanization, and the four major market
participants' disciplined behavior.
thyssenkrupp is the fourth-largest elevator and escalator producer after Otis Elevator Co., KONE Corp., and Schindler
Elevator Corp. Otis is the largest, with estimated market share of 17%-18% in 2017. thyssenkrupp was at 13%-14% and
other players were between the two. The elevator market is mature and, outside of Japan, dominated by these players.
Elevators and escalators are sold with service contracts with significantly higher margins than on equipment. Elevators
and escalators are very highly used assets, and therefore the service network is the most important asset for all global
players. Contract renewal rates in the business are high, and the service aspects form an effective barrier to entry.

Aspects positively influencing our assessment are the low volatility of cash flows due to more than 50% of sales being
aftermarket, significant scale and scope, high diversification in terms of geographies and customers, and high cash
conversion. At the same time, the elevator business' margins are somewhat below its peers, with an approximately
16% EBITDA margin, and it has a somewhat smaller scale as the no. 4 global player in the market. We view Elevator
Technology's stand-alone business profile at the higher end of satisfactory category. We do not rate other elevator
manufacturers.
We view components technologies, comprising auto components and forged technologies, as weaker than the
elevators segment. This is partially due to its relatively low margins in the auto segment, but benefiting from its proven
technology and position as a global components supplier focusing on products, which are only partially affected by the
auto industry's shift away from combustion engines.
The auto segment (with about €5.5 billion in sales) produces high-tech components for the industry. The product
spectrum in the powertrain area includes integrated camshafts and cylinder head modules. In the chassis area, the
range incorporates manufactured steering and damper systems as well as springs and stabilizers and axis module
assembly. We view positively thyssenkrupp position as Tier 1 supplier for the most global auto OEMs, its product
range containing technologically advanced components such as steering systems, and our view that the expected
increase of electric vehicle volumes will likely benefit the business. Credit negatives include the limited scale and scope
of the business compared to large global auto suppliers, the segment's low profitability, and high investment needs.
The bearings and forged technologies segment produces rather low-tech but high precision components for
heavy-duty vehicles, industrial applications, and the wind turbine industry. The product offer includes bearings,
crankshafts and connecting tools.
Industrial solutions and marine systems, in our view, are the weakest components in thyssenkrupp's non-materials
business mix. Industrial solutions engages in large-scale turn-key engineering projects in process industries, in
particular chemicals, mining, and cement. We positively note the company's global market position and technology
base, the segment's low capex needs, and low fixed cost base. Nevertheless, industrial solutions is losing money, and
we don't expect it to materially contribute to EBITDA over the forecast period. Further aspects negatively affecting our
assessment are the end markets' inherent high volatility, and high cash flow volatility and project risks due to the
nature of the business as a turn-key contractor. Also, marine systems, a manufacturer of surface vessels and
submarines, is exposed to project-related risks, leading to cash flow volatility; and has weak profitability, currently near
break-even. However, due to the expected limited revenue and EBITDA contribution in the context of the wider group,
it has limited relevance in our analysis.
Materials-related businesses , comprising the group's European steel operations and distribution and trading, benefit
from established market positions. Materials services is one of the leading steel distributors in Europe (the other being
ArcelorMittal), contributing about €14 billion in group sales. The business area has market leading position Germany
and holds top 4 positions in Europe and North America, which we do not expect to change.
On steel, thyssenkrupp is a large-scale producer with strong presence in more resilient markets and industries. Its
product mix skews toward premium flat carbon steels, especially for the auto industry and other steel using sectors

thyssenkrupp AG

with demanding quality and service requirements. This results in somewhat less volatility in price and volume
compared with that of pure commodity peers. However, the company's ranking has gone down considerably, from
being in the top-15 global steel producers globally in 2017 to ranking at 32 in 2018 (according to the WorldSteel
Association). The European steel market is facing headwinds due to cheaper imports from China resulting in
oversupply and capacity under-usage, which we do not expect to change in the medium term. Given the steel
industry's cyclical nature, we expect earnings volatility to persist.

Financial Risk: Aggressive
We base our modest assessment of thyssenkrupp's financial risk profile on the company's weakened key credit metrics
and negative free cash flow, which we expect to continue in 2020. Our base-case scenario assumes that thyssenkrupp's
FFO-to-debt in 2020 will be around 15%, despite the planned partial IPO, due to ongoing negative free cash flow and
weak market conditions.
As of June 30, 2019, thyssenkrupp's gross financial debt had increased to €7.9 billion due to the issuance of €1.5 billion
of bonds and usage of €1.0 billion of the existing commercial paper program with a maximum emission volume of €1.5
billion. In July 2019, the company redeemed €1,25 billion of bonds. We primarily adjust thyssenkrupp's debt by adding
net pension liabilities and the present value of operating leases to the amount of financial debt. We estimate net
pension liabilities at €7.3 billion (netted by pension related tax assets). Overall, our base-case scenario estimates
thyssenkrupp's adjusted debt at €12.3 billion at the end of this fiscal year and at €11.1 billion at the end of fiscal
2019-2020. Cash on balance sheet is netted with financial obligations outstanding.

Liquidity: Adequate
We assess thyssenkrupp's liquidity as adequate, based on our expectation that sources of liquidity will exceed uses by
1.7x over the next year. We view the group's bank relationships as well established and its financial risk management
as prudent. The short-term rating is 'B', reflecting the long-term issuer credit rating and our assessment of the
company's liquidity.
thyssenkrupp has no meaningful long-term debt maturities over the next 12 months. From the current bonds, a €750
million 1.75% note is due in November 2020 and a €850 million 2.75% note in March 2021. We expect thyssenkrupp
will address these maturities well in advance, based on the group's past practice.
We estimate that principal liquidity sources for the next 12 months include:
• Estimated freely available cash and cash equivalents of approximately €1.6 billion (after repayment of a €1.25
million bond in July 2019);
• Availability of approximately €3.6 billion under committed credit lines maturing beyond next 12 months. We expect
the group will remain in line with covenants on its main €2.0 billion syndicated revolving credit facility, committed
until March 2021; and
• Cash FFO generation that we estimate at about €1.2 billion

Over the same period, we estimate that principal liquidity uses include:
• Estimated short-term maturities of approximately €1.1 billion, which we expect the company to roll over;
• Annual capex of approximately €1.5 billion;
• Working capital outflow and intrayear swings of about €700 million according to our internal estimates; and
• Annual moderate dividend payments reflecting the group's financial policy.

• 2019: €0
• 2020: €750 million
• 2021: €850 million

Environmental, Social, And Governance

Environmental, social, and governance factors do not affect our rating on thyssenkrupp, albeit over the past two
years, activist shareholders have initiated significant changes in the group's strategy, leading to the ongoing
unwinding of the conglomerate structure, and meaningful restructuring and reorganization expenses.
The group, in our view, has demonstrated the ability to deal with the most meaningful factors for the sector, which
are management of resources from and environmental perspective and employee management from the social
point of view, despite the ongoing significant shifts in the group structure. thyssenkrupp has targeted implementing
an ISO 14001 environmental management system by fiscal year 2019-2020, covering all relevant environmental
aspects such as reducing wastewater, emissions, and the environmental impact of products through to disposal.
The most important environmental factor for thysenkrupp is the use of energy. The group's energy consumption
came to more than 70 terawatt-hours in the 2017-2018 fiscal year. The group's steel operations consume the vast
majority of this. The remaining operations accounted for six terawatt-hours. thyssenkrupp adheres to a high
disclosure standards in line with other large international publicly listed groups.

Issue Ratings - Recovery Analysis
Key analytical factors
• We rate thyssenkrupp's various senior unsecured notes and the €2.0 billion senior revolving credit facility 'BB-'; the
recovery rating on these debt instruments is '3'.
• Our recovery expectations are in the upper half of the 50%-70% range (rounded estimate: 65%).
• Under our hypothetical scenario, a default would follow the planned IPO not materializing, leaving the current debt
structure in place; a persisting weakness in the industries in which thyssenkrupp operates; and operating setbacks
leading to deteriorating financial performance, permanent negative free cash flow, and an inability to refinance key
obligations.
• We value thyssenkrupp as a going concern, given the significant market positions of several of its core divisions.
• Nevertheless, we believe that many parts of the company could be broken up and sold separately, and would
provide significant value to creditors in a break-up scenario.
• In particular, the stable profile and inherent value of the elevators business would be likely to offer significant
creditor protection in most thinkable scenarios.
