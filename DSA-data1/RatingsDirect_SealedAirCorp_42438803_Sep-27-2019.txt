Acquisition-dependent growth strategy and sizable ongoing restructuring costs will limit any

Shift to parcel-ready packaging solutions will be the primary focus over the next several years. We expect Sealed Air to
aggressively expand its offerings of parcel-ready solutions to support the ever growing e-commerce market and
increasingly constrained fulfillment value chain. Bolt-on opportunities, like its recent acquisition of Automated
Packaging Systems (APS), are most likely to be Sealed Air's means of expanding its parcel-ready offerings.
Expect flat to negative organic revenue growth over the next 12 months. A slowdown in Sealed Air's product care
segment and currency headwinds have offset steady growth in the food care segment. We expect this trend to
continue because weakness in key end-markets, such as industrial and electronics, is likely to persist.
Don't expect meaningful deleveraging any time soon. With the company's muted operating outlook and various cash
needs over the next year, including ongoing restructuring costs and potential bolt-on acquisitions, we don't expect any
meaningful debt reduction over the next few years. At best, we expect leverage to be at the higher end of the 4x to 5x
range, with any additional bolt-on acquisition only likely to further weaken credit metrics.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our expectation that Sealed Air will maintain leverage in the 4x to 5x range, despite our
expectations for muted operating performance over the next 12 months. We expect that stable demand in the
company's food care segment will largely offset weakness in its product care segment. We expect that the
company will maintain positive operating cash flows, which should be sufficient to meet the majority of cash
obligation, such as capital expenditures and shareholder rewards.

Downside scenario
We could lower our ratings on Sealed Air if the company's credit metrics weakened to above 5x on a sustained
basis. This could occur if the company's operating margins declined by 300 basis points (bps) below our base case
scenario. We could also lower our ratings if the company pursues acquisitions or shareholder rewards that result in
credit metrics deteriorating to the aforementioned levels.

Upside scenario
Although highly unlikely, we could raise our ratings on Sealed Air if its credit metrics improved to well below 4x on
a sustained basis. In addition to any improved credit metrics, we would require Sealed Air to explicitly commit to
financial policies supportive of an investment grade rating.

Company Description
Sealed Air Corp. is a designer and manufacturer of packaging systems and solutions, primarily focused on perishable
foods and parcel protection. The company operates through two segments: food care (61% of 2018 sales) and product
care (39%). The food care segment provides packaging materials and fully integrated packaging systems used by
perishable food processors that predominantly focus on fresh red meat, smoked and processed meats, poultry, and
dairy (solids and liquids). The product care segment provides both value-add (i.e. inflatable bubble wrap, surface
protection, temperature control) and stand-alone solutions (i.e. padded envelopes) that focus on the protection and
integrity of products during shipment. Sealed Air serves about 50,000 customers across 48 countries through 100
facilities located throughout the globe. The company generated sales of $4.7 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $801
million for the trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2019.

Business Risk: Strong
Our assessment reflects Sealed Air's established position as a leader in the highly perishable food space, somewhat
offset by the product care segment's exposure to cyclical end-markets and changing market dynamics in e-commerce,
which could pressure the segment over the next few years.
Sealed Air is an established leader within the highly perishable food packaging space. The company has developed
innovative solutions, such as vacuum-shrink wrapping systems, that have become the industry standard for packaging
and maintaining food quality and stringent health requirements for highly perishable items, such as uncooked and
cooked animal proteins, seafood, and dairy products. Sealed Air provides these solutions through its food care
segment, which offers both fully integrated packaging systems and related materials. This operating segment enjoys
predictable, recurring sales volumes supported by stable demand trends in global protein consumption. In addition, we
believe Sealed Air enjoys modest barriers-to-entry in this niche market due to the stringent regulations governing food
safety standards; the company's expansive network of packaging systems, which are fully integrated into customers'
production processes; and few, if any, viable alternatives. We believe long-term growth trends remain favorable, as
global per capita meat consumption continues to rise and increasing consumer preference for fresh, uncooked protein

should support growing demand for Sealed Air's food packaging systems and solutions.
Sealed Air is also a notable provider of parcel protection solutions. Through the product care segment, the company
offers a wide range of protective solutions, such as bubble wrap and air pillows, that have become ubiquitous within
shipping packages. This segment enjoys good end-market diversity, supported by its broad application. It also has
significant exposure (31% of product care sales) to the e-commerce market, which is expected to see sustained,
multiyear growth. However, competition is high because there are a number of direct competitors (i.e. Pregis) and
alternatives solutions, such as crumpled paper (i.e. Ranpak), that offer similar value-add functions (i.e. void fill,
cushioning) to that of Sealed Air.
There are several macro and industry-specific challenges that we see affecting the product care segment over the next
several years. Despite its good end-market diversification, the segment has significant exposure to cyclical
end-markets, such as the industrials and electronics (roughly half of its sales). A slowdown in these markets has
contributed to volume declines in recent quarters, and we expect this trend to persist in line with macro-demand
trends. There is also growing concern over the environmental impact of single-use plastics. This has driven many
customers to assess alternative solutions, such as paper-based protection, despite plastics being a relatively lower-cost
option. Finally, there is growing demand for parcel-ready shipping, particularly within e-commerce. Parcel-ready
solutions focuses on automated, form-fitted packaging that has protective cushioning materials already embedded into
the shipping parcel. We expect this shift to improve the overall fulfillment throughput time, but also reduce demand for
a la carte protective packaging, such as air cushions and bubble wrap.
We believe the company's "Reinvent SEE" strategy will somewhat address these challenges. Announced in December
2018, the Reinvent SEE initiative is an overhaul of the company's entire value chain, with an emphasis on product
innovation, speed-to-market, and operational and productivity improvements. As part of its focus on product
innovation and speed-to-market, we expect Sealed Air to shift its product care segment to focus more on stand-alone,
parcel ready solutions. We view this shift favorably because it is consistent with changing market dynamics, including
increasing automation and improving fulfillment throughput time in the e-commerce market and reducing the use of
single-use plastics. It should also strengthen the company's value proposition as a one-stop-shop for packaging
solutions, particularly within the e-commerce segment, and thereby strengthening customer relations. However, this is
a multiyear strategy that we believe will require significant investment before realizing sizable, tangible benefits. We
expect the company to pursue this strategy primarily through acquisitions, such as its recent $510 million purchase of
APS.

Sealed Air's peer group includes Silgan Holdings, Berry Global Inc., and Packaging Corp. of America. Sealed Air is one
of the smaller companies in the peer group in terms of overall sales volume, but comparable based on adjusted
EBITDA.
Silgan is a manufacturer of rigid packaging solutions (primarily metal) and closures used mainly in food applications.
Silgan is an indirect competitor to Sealed Air because most of Silgan's food-related solutions focus on non-perishables
items with an extended shelf life. Berry Global, pro forma for its acquisition of RPC, is one of the largest players in the
packaging space and possibly the largest in plastics. Berry somewhat competes with Sealed Air in the food end-market
because Berry also provides various film solutions for packaging and storing meat products. Packaging Corp. of
America is a manufacturer of paper-based packaging solutions used across various end-markets and applications that
emphasis product protection. Packaging Corp. competes somewhat with Sealed Air's product care segment because

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 11, 2019 8

Sealed Air Corp.

both companies offer solutions that focus on similar protection solutions, but Packaging Corp.'s offerings tend to focus
on heavier product applications.
Other notable private competitors include Reynolds, which competes directly with the food care segment, and Pregis,
which offers plastic protection solutions similar to those of the product care segment.

Financial Risk: Aggressive
Our assessment reflects our expectation that the company will maintain leverage between 4x and 5x, despite our
expectation for flat sales trends and ongoing restructuring costs.
Sealed Air's overall operating performance was down for the first half of 2019. Sales were down 1% (up 4% on a
constant currency basis) because currency headwinds and core declines in product care were partially offset by core
growth in food care and acquisition contributions. Adjusted EBITDA margins saw a 200 bps decline primarily due to
higher legacy restructuring costs and costs associated with Reinvent SEE. Adjusted debt to EBITDA was
approximately 5x for the 12 months ended June 30, 2019.
Over the next 12 months, we expect many of these factors to persist, contributing to flat to low-single-digit percentage
sales declines. On a segment basis, we expect flat to slightly lower food care sales, with low-single-digit percentage
growth in core volumes offset by currency headwinds. Within product care, we expect overall sales to be flat to slightly
up, with core volume declines and currency headwinds largely offset by contributions from the APS acquisition. We
expected adjusted EBITDA margins to be about 18% since ongoing Reinvent SEE restructuring costs are somewhat
offset by contributions from completed restructurings and acquisition synergies.
We expect that the company will be able to satisfy capital expenditures and shareholder rewards primarily through
operating cash flows, with ample capacity on its $1 billion credit facility to address any shortfalls. Given that Sealed
Air's debt capital structure comprises primarily notes, we do not expect any meaningful debt reduction over the next
several years. If anything, we believe total leverage is more likely than not to increase as the company continues to
pursue bolt-on, debt-funded acquisitions, such as APS, as it shifts product care to more parcel-ready solutions. As a
result, we expect that the company will pursue dollar-for-dollar refinancing as its various tranches of notes approach
maturity.
Given all these factors, we expect that Sealed Air will still be able to maintain leverage in the 4x to 5x range over the
next 12 months, albeit at the very high end of the range.
While the recent dismissal of Sealed Air's former CFO does not reflect well on the company, we believe it is an isolated
incident. More importantly, we do not believe it is a reflection of the company's internal controls or financial reporting,
which are the areas of greatest risk.

Liquidity: Adequate
We assess Sealed Air's liquidity as adequate and estimate that sources over the next 12-18 months will exceed uses by
about 4.4x and believe that its net sources will remain positive even if forecast EBITDA declines by 15%. Qualitative
factors, including covenant headroom, the company's sizable share-repurchase programs, and our view that Sealed Air
could not withstand a high-impact, low-probability event without some need for refinancing preclude a stronger
assessment.

As of June 30, 2019, the company was in compliance with its maximum net leverage ratio covenant, and we expect it
to remain compliant, with at least 15% headroom, over the next 12 months.

Requirements
Sealed Air's credit agreement requires that the company's maximum net leverage ratio does not exceed 4.5x on the
last day of each fiscal quarter. However, this ratio is increased to 5x for the first four full quarters following a material
acquisition.

Issue Ratings - Recovery Analysis
Key analytical factors
• Our simulated default scenario contemplates severe cash flow stress resulting in a payment default in 2024. We
assume that resin costs are very high for a prolonged period and that the company cannot fully pass these increases
through to customers because of weak recessionary economic conditions and decreased demand.
• We valued Sealed Air on a going-concern basis, since we believe company creditors would realize greater recovery
through reorganization rather than liquidation.
• We estimate a $3.1 billion gross recovery value based on an emergence EBITDA of $515 million and a 6x EBITDA
multiple.
• 85% of the revolver is drawn at default.
