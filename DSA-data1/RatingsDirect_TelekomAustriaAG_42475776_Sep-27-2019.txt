Key risks

Leading telecommunications operator in Austria, with about 37% mobile and
55% fixed-line broadband subscriber market shares.

Fierce competition in the domestic mobile business from
Hutchison Drei, T-Mobile, and mobile virtual network operators
(MVNOs), as well as in several CEE markets.

Favorable domestic frequency holdings, with about half of the total spectrum
available in Austria.

May face some pressure to scale up its fixed-network
investments in Austria, given that 50 megabits per second
(Mbps) broadband coverage is less than 50%.

No. 1 or No. 2 mobile positions in five of its six Central and Eastern European
(CEE) mobile markets, complemented by an expanding fixed-line offering.

Partly inflexible cost structure in Austria due to a high proportion
of civil servants in the workforce (19% in 2018 at the group
level).

Robust free operating cash flow (FOCF) generation of €400 million-€500
million and supportive financial policy targeting further deleveraging, with
limited merger and acquisition (M&A) risks.

Exposure to very high country risks in Belarus.

S&P Global Ratings expects Telekom Austria AG to further deleverage over 2020-2021. We anticipate that Telekom
Austria's financial risk profile will strengthen in 2020-2021, based on the company's financial policy to deleverage
toward 1.5x, from 2.0x at June 30, 2019. We also see limited M&A risks and continued sound operating performance,
leading to slightly increasing EBITDA and the capacity to cut debt. This is based on steady discretionary cash flow
(DCF) generation of about €300 million annually before spectrum investments.
We expect the company's sound operating performance to continue. We forecast positive service revenue growth,
supported by mobile Wi-Fi router uptake and an improving customer mix on the fixed side, stemming from TV and
fiber upselling and from the enterprise segment. This should mitigate the negative trend in retail fixed voice and some
modest pressure on the fixed broadband subscriber base.
We think foreign operations will provide faster growth. In our view, the company's CEE operations will provide
additional growth and increasing opportunities to sell higher-end fixed and mobile converged services. This geographic
diversity across six different countries should also mitigate country and volatility risks.
The company is likely to see a slight EBITDA increase. Telekom Austria has a relatively rigid cost structure due to the
high share of civil servants (45% of domestic employees, and 19% at the group level), and heavy annual cash
restructuring outflows of €100 million. However, we foresee the slight potential for improving margins due to

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 16, 2019 3

Telekom Austria AG

cost-cutting measures. We forecast EBITDA growth of 2% per year (after restructuring costs) spurred by positive
service revenue.

Outlook: Stable

The outlook is stable because we expect Telekom Austria will continue to increase its service revenue in the
Austrian and CEE markets and successfully manage its cost base. We also expect that management will remain
focused on further improving credit metrics.
In our view, credit metrics will steadily and sustainably strengthen to levels commensurate with the rating in
2020-2021--namely adjusted debt to EBITDA of below 2.5x, funds from operations (FFO) to debt of 35%-40%, and
FOCF (before spectrum outlays) to debt approaching 15%.

Downside scenario
Rating downside could occur if the company's operating performance or deleveraging path failed to meet our
forecasts, preventing adjusted debt to EBITDA from strengthening sustainably below 2.5x and FOCF to debt
toward 15%. This could result from a less conservative financial policy than we anticipate, fiercer competition and
lower prices than we expect, or higher-than-expected capital expenditure (capex). In addition, if we lower our
rating on the majority shareholder America Movil S.A.B. de C.V. (AMX; A-/Negative/--) to 'BBB' or below, this
could prompt a downgrade.

Upside scenario
Rating upside is unlikely since this would require a financial policy geared toward materially lower leverage than
we currently foresee.

about 33% in 2019-2021, based on International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 16 accounting.
• Cash outflows for restructuring of €100 million per
year.
• Capex, excluding spectrum costs, of about €800
million, due to fixed broadband investments in
Austria and mobile network upgrades in all markets,
plus moderate spectrum costs.

Base-case projections
We forecast steadily declining adjusted leverage. We expect debt to EBITDA (IFRS 16 figures) of 2.6x in 2019, 2.5x in
2020, and 2.3x in 2021, compared with 2.7x in 2018 (pro forma IFRS 16 as by our estimates).
The company's cash flow metrics will strengthen. We forecast adjusted FFO to debt will increase toward 37%-39% by
2021 and adjusted FOCF (excluding spectrum outlays) to debt of 11%-12% in 2019, progressing toward 13%-15%
thereafter.

Company Description
Headquartered in Vienna, Telekom Austria is the leading telecom operator in Austria and a mobile operator in
Bulgaria, Croatia, Belarus, Slovenia, Serbia, and Macedonia. It also provides fixed-line broadband, telephony, and TV
services in all of these countries except Serbia. In 2018, the domestic market contributed about 60% of the group's
€4.4 billion in revenue and two-thirds of its €1.5 billion EBITDA.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
Telekom Austria benefits from its strong incumbent market position in Austria and robust market positions in most of
its six CEE markets. However, this is balanced by intense competition in the mobile segment, both domestically and
internationally.
A key factor in our assessment of Telekom Austria's business risk is the company's leading position in Austria's
wealthy, albeit mature and relatively small, market for fixed and mobile telecom services, and its solid positions in CEE
mobile markets (see chart 1).
Chart 1

The company had an Austrian mobile subscriber market share of about 37% in first-half 2019, ahead of T-Mobile and
Hutchison Drei. In addition, we think Telekom Austria is likely to benefit from its ample spectrum holdings. Once
spectrum reassignments to Telekom Austria from Hutchison Drei are completed in 2020, the company will hold half of
the spectrum available in the 800 megahertz (MHz), 900 MHz, and 1,800 MHz bands, up from about 44% today.
That said, competition in Austria's mobile market remains intense, reinforced by the presence of several MVNOs,
which will continue to constrain pricing. In addition, we think the recent acquisition of UPC by T-Mobile could
modestly dent Telekom Austria's mobile market share over time, because we expect T-Mobile to actively cross-sell its
mobile plans to UPC's broadband and TV customers.
Telekom Austria reported a 55% fixed-line broadband market share in first-half 2019, well ahead of DT-UPC Austria
(see chart 2). Historically, the Austrian broadband market has oriented toward the development of mobile broadband,

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 16, 2019 6

Telekom Austria AG

and fixed broadband penetration has lagged the EU average. In addition, competitive conditions have led to a decrease
of Telekom Austria's mobile and fixed broadband subscriber market shares by about 2 percentage points (pps) over the
past two years.
That said, the company's market share in fixed retail broadband remains significantly stronger than most of its
incumbent peers in Europe.
Chart 2

In fixed line, we believe Telekom Austria benefits from the limited presence of alternative high-speed broadband
infrastructure in its domestic market. The cable network of the main fixed broadband competitor UPC, now owned by
T-Mobile Austria, covers less than 40% of Austrian households. Outside the UPC footprint, Telekom Austria mainly
competes with mobile broadband products, in addition to some competition based on regulated wholesale access to its
own network and small local utility-owned cable networks. In these areas, we think the company's competitive
position could be enhanced by its ongoing fixed-network upgrade program.
Including hybrid broadband products, which bundle fixed and mobile technologies, Telekom Austria offered
broadband with download speeds of at least 40 Mbps to 98% of all Austrian households at year-end 2018. Given that
only 25% of the company's customers subscribed to products with above 40 Mbps download speeds as of December
2017, we see further potential for upselling.
We think that Telekom Austria's profitable and cash-generative operations in six CEE mobile markets (No. 1 or No. 2
in five countries) help to diversify its revenue base and provide incremental scale. The largest international operations

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 16, 2019 7

Telekom Austria AG

(by revenue) are its subsidiaries in Croatia, which reported a 37% mobile market share and an EBITDA margin of
about 32% in first-half 2019. This compared with 39% mobile market share and 39% EBITDA margin in Bulgaria and
42% mobile market share and 45% EBITDA margin in Belarus. Since 2015, Telekom Austria has strengthened its
fixed-mobile convergence offering in CEE through various acquisitions of smaller fixed-line or cable operators. It is
now able to offer fixed telephony, broadband, and TV in all of its markets except Serbia. In Serbia and in other
countries without its own fixed-line infrastructure, Telekom Austria utilizes Wi-Fi routers to compete with converged
players and save on wholesale access fees.
Telekom Austria's foreign mobile operations face fierce competition, particularly in Slovenia, Serbia, and Bulgaria. In
our view, this contributes to revenue and earnings volatility, which we think is generally higher for the company's
international operations than for its domestic business. Telekom Austria's subsidiary in Belarus is subject to high
country risks and foreign exchange-rate volatility.

Peer comparison
We rate Telekom Austria at the same level as peers like Telia and Elisa. Although it is larger and more diversified than
Elisa, the latter has significantly lower leverage. Conversely, Telekom Austria has a smaller scale than Telia and its
geographic portfolio is exposed to higher volatility risks, but we expect it to have lower leverage. We think Telekom
Austria's business risk is similar to that of Proximus, with greater geographic diversity mitigated by related country
risks. Our rating on Proximus is higher, however, due the company's very low leverage and a one-notch uplift
stemming from potential government support.

Financial Risk: Intermediate
Telekom Austria's M&A strategy has moderated compared with our previous expectations. We therefore believe that
the company's financial risk profile will steadily improve in the next two years, mainly due to management's
willingness to reduce leverage and our view that sustained sound operating performance should provide adequate
capacity to trim debt, except for one-off spectrum outlays.

1.5x in the 12 months started July 1, 2019. In addition, we assess Telekom Austria's financial risk management as
prudent, and we think that the company has well-established, solid relationships with its banks, underpinned by the
repeated issuance of bank facilities at highly favorable terms and with a variety of lenders.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Availability of a €1 billion committed revolving
credit facility (RCF) due 2024.
• Sizable FFO of €1.2 billion.

• Capex (including spectrum payments) of €0.8 billion.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

The group's energy consumption is its main environmental consideration. Increasing data traffic results in
ever-increasing energy use, with the company's electricity consumption increasing by about 5% in 2018. The group
has a policy in place to achieve energy efficiency, with a reported a 24% gain between 2017 and 2018. In 2018, the
group reported 62% of its energy needs were met from renewable sources. We think ongoing plans to increase
fiber-to-the-home deployment will also help to contain potential upward pressure on energy costs. As a result,
these costs are not a material risk to our forecast.

Group Influence
We continue to regard Telekom Austria as a moderately strategic subsidiary of its 51% shareholder AMX. That said,
our 'BBB+' rating on Telekom Austria is based on our stand-alone view of its credit quality, and does not include any
uplift from potential extraordinary group. Any uplift for potential group support is capped at one notch below the
parent rating, which is 'A-', whereas our view of Telekom Austria's stand-alone credit quality is 'bbb+'. Still, we
understand that AMX is regularly involved in the company's strategic decisions and day-to-day management, and also
supportive of its financial policy, which is a positive factor captured in our stand-alone assessment.

Government Influence
We continue to regard Telekom Austria as a government-related entity (GRE), based on the 28.4% stake held by
Austria (AA+/Stable/A-1+). That said, our 'BBB+' rating on Telekom Austria is based on our stand-alone view of its
credit quality, and does not include any uplift from potential extraordinary government support. We see a low
likelihood of timely and sufficient extraordinary government support for Telekom Austria in the event of financial
distress.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
The vast majority of debt is senior unsecured and located at the group's financing entity, Telekom Finanzmanagement
GmbH.

Analytical conclusions
The long-term issue rating on the company's senior unsecured debt is 'BBB+', in line with the issuer credit rating,
because no significant elements of subordination risk are present in the capital structure.
