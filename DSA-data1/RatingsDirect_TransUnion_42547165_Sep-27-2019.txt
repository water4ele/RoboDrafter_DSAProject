Credit Highlights
Overview
Key strengths

Key risks

Solid market position in consumer credit information
services and analytics.

Exposed to regulatory and information security risks.

High barriers to entry through large amount of consumer
private data.

Concentration in cyclical consumer credit and financial services industry.

Good operating efficiency supporting stable profitability
and cash flow generation.

Use of free cash flow to fund its acquisitive growth strategy, as well as return cash to
shareholders through share buybacks.

High entry barriers to help sustain market position as one of the top three national credit reporting agencies (NCRAs).
TransUnion's dominant position stems from its vast amount of credit data on individuals, its processing algorithms,
and its infrastructure, which create high barriers to entry due to the time and investment required to replicate. The
company's services are embedded into customer workflow systems, which creates stickiness and increases switching
costs, as changing a service provider leads to some near term business interruptions.
Exposure to increasing regulatory scrutiny and cybersecurity risks requires regular investments, limiting improvement in
profitability. TransUnion deals with sensitive and confidential consumer information, which requires it to secure data
from any potential cybersecurity threats and also prevent misuse of personal information. Regulatory scrutiny on
NCRAs has increased significantly following a major data breach incident at Equifax Inc. S&P Global Ratings believes
the company will have to increase investments to prevent any potential cybersecurity threat and comply with
regulatory requirements, thus preventing any major improvement in margins.
Exposed to cyclicality as major demand for credit information is generated by financial services industry.The company
generates majority of its revenues from financial service providers who depend on favorable macroeconomic
conditions for growth. Over the last few years, TransUnion has diversified into other verticals like health care,
insurance, and other nonbanking applications, which reduces potential volatility from macroeconomic factors, but we
still believe its operations have somewhat high correlation to macroeconomic trends as bank and other credit
generating institutions continue account for a significant portion of revenue. For example, in the first quarter of 2019,
top line growth moderated to the mid-single digits organically compared to high-single digits to low-double digits in
the previous four quarters due to weak mortgage markets in U.S. But with declines in mortgage rates and pick-up in
new and existing home sales from the second quarter of 2019, organic revenue growth improved to a high-single-digit

rate.
Operates with a somewhat aggressive financial policy, focusing on acquisitive growth as well as shareholder-friendly
actions. TransUnion has an active acquisition strategy to diversify into new verticals and geographies, and gain a
footing in verticals in which it has a presence. We also expect the company to spend about $60 million annually on
distributions to shareholders. After significant debt-financed acquisition activity in 2018, adjusted debt to EBITDA
(S&P Global Ratings basis) increased to the mid-4x area by the end of 2018, but we expect debt to EBITDA to
decrease to the high-3x area by the end of 2019 due to incremental EBITDA contribution from these acquisitions and
modest organic growth. We expect adjusted debt to EBITDA to further improve modestly but remain in the mid-3x
area on a sustained basis as benefit from EBITDA growth will be offset by the company's moderately aggressive
financial policy.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on TransUnion reflects our view that leverage will decline and remain below 4x (S&P Global
Ratings basis) due to continued strong revenue growth rates and EBITDA margin expansion to be supported by
favorable demand across all segments, new product introductions, and continued focus on operating efficiency. We
expect the company to continue to generate strong free cash flow, which we think it will apply toward new tuck-in
acquisitions, shareholder returns, and modest debt repayment.

Downside scenario
We could lower the ratings on TransUnion if the company were to adopt a more aggressive financial policy,
including greater-than-expected shareholder distributions and acquisitions, leading to debt leverage sustained
above 4x. Less likely factors that could trigger a downgrade include a significant business downturn or an
unforeseen loss in business stemming from a cybersecurity breach that would lead to consolidated revenue
declines and rising costs over the next 12 months.

Upside scenario
We could raise the ratings on TransUnion if changes in financial policy, better-than-expected operating
performance, or debt reduction through excess cash flows were to result in funds from operations to debt
increasing to over 30% while leverage declines to and stays below 3x. An upgrade would also be contingent upon
our belief that the company's financial policy would maintain these metrics for the long term.

• We expect revenues to grow by a low-teens

global GDP growth, resulting from additional
revenue contribution from major acquisitions
completed in 2018, new product introductions, new
client wins, and demand in key verticals;

organic growth.
• Adjusted EBITDA margins should improve modestly
but remain in the 39% to 40% area over 2019-2020.
We believe benefit from improvement in operating
efficiency and synergies from recent acquisitions will
be largely offset by sustained investments to comply
with regulatory requirements and protect consumer
data.
• We expect capital spending between 7.5% and 8.0%
of revenues, translating to about $200 million in
2019.
• We expect acquisition activity at moderate levels
limited to smaller tuck-in acquisitions funded mostly
through free cash flow; and
• Dividend spending of about $60 million annually.

Company Description
TransUnion is one of the leading global providers of consumer and commercial credit information. TransUnion
collects, organizes, and manages credit, financial, demographic, and marketing information regarding individuals. It
amasses and processes this data using proprietary systems, and makes the data available to customers in various
formats to helps them in marketing and acquire customers. The company sources this data from financial or credit
granting institutions, private databases, public records repositories, etc.
TransUnion has three reportable segments:
• U.S. Markets(59% of 2018 revenues): Provides consumer and commercial information solutions to businesses in the

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 26, 2019 5

TransUnion

U.S., including consumer credit information reports; risk scores; and analytical and decision-making services.
Customers include banks, auto lenders, mortgage lenders, health care, insurance, and property management
companies.
• International (20% of revenues): Serves select international markets including Canada, the U.K., Latin America, and
India. Services provided to these markets are similar to those provided in the U.S.
• Consumer Interactive (21% of revenues): Helps consumers manage their personal finances by providing credit
reports and scores, and financial management services, while also providing fraud protection and resolution
services.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
Our assessment of business risk reflects TransUnion's sustainable market position as one of the top three NCRAs due
to high entry barriers, good operating efficiency, and strong profitability. Despite operating on a smaller scale
compared to the other two NCRAs, TransUnion's market position is defensible as customers prefer to obtain credit
information from multiple providers as the data available with these NCRAs is often asymmetrical, requiring access to
multiple credit reports to get a complete picture. The company's sustained investment in IT infrastructure has helped it
lower operating costs by enabling it to access data with better speeds and efficiency, thus improving productivity and
lowering turnaround time, while also helping it develop new products at a faster pace.
TransUnion faces significant legal and reputational risk associated with the storage, processing, and security of vast
quantities of sensitive personal data of individuals and businesses. Our assessment also considers the company's
exposure to economic cycles as a significant portion of revenues are generated from financial service providers,
despite its recent efforts to diversify into other verticals including health care, property management, public sector, and
other non-banking applications.

Peer comparison
We rate two of TransUnion's direct competitors, Experian and Equifax. TransUnion's weaker rating mainly stems from
its aggressive financial policy compared to the other two, which supports acquisition funded with a mix of cash and
debt, which could temporarily raise leverage above 4x. Experian's better business risk score reflects its relatively large
scale and broader geographic and end-market diversification. Equifax and TransUnion both have a similar business
risk assessment even though TransUnion operates on a smaller scale. Equifax's elevated spending is related to its 2017
data breach and "Equifax 2020" initiative to modernize its business and technology platform.

Financial Risk: Significant
Our assessment of TransUnion's financial risk reflects our expectations of adjusted debt to EBITDA holding in the midto high-3x area over the 2019-2020 period. Although leverage increased significantly to 4.4x at the end of 2018
following a string of acquisitions in mid-2018, we believe TransUnion will reduce leverage below 4x due to continued
strong operating performance, contributions, and synergies from recent acquisitions, and expanding EBITDA margins.
We project the company will generate about $430 million to $450 million of free operating cash flows in 2019, which
will be used to fund tuck-in acquisitions of about $300 million and shareholder dividends of about $60 million, rather
than debt repayment.

Liquidity: Strong
We assess TransUnion's liquidity as strong, due to our expectation that sources of cash will exceed uses by at least
1.5x over the next 12 months, and by 1x or more for the subsequent 12 months. We expect net uses would be positive
and there would be sufficient covenant headroom even if there was a 30% decline in forecasted EBITDA.

Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Cash balance of about $195 million, as of June 30,
2019;

• Annual capital expenditures of about $200 million;

• Access to an undrawn $300 million revolving credit
facility that matures in 2022; and
• About $700 million in operating cash flow over the
next twelve months.

• Debt amortization of approximately $75 million to
$85 million over the next 12 months; and
• Dividend distributions of approximately $60 million
per year.

Debt maturities
As of June 30, 2019, TransUnion's debt maturities were:
• $300 million senior secured revolving credit facility due in August 2022 is undrawn;
• Senior secured term loan A-2 due August 2022: $1.15 billion outstanding
• Senior secured term loan B-3 due April 2023: $1.8 billion outstanding
• Senior secured term loan B-4 due June 2025: $978 million outstanding.

Covenant Analysis
Compliance expectations
TransUnion complied with its maximum-leverage covenant as of fiscal year-end 2018 and second-quarter end of 2019.
We believe the company will continue to be compliant with EBITDA headroom in excess of 30%.

Requirements
The senior secured credit facilities are subject to a maximum senior secured net leverage covenant ratio of 5.5x.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

Given the private and sensitive information they handle, credit bureaus such as TransUnion are exposed to risks
surrounding the protection of confidential data. Personal identifying information includes names, social security
numbers, birth dates, addresses, and driver's license numbers. The company operate in an environment of
significant cybersecurity risk. Cyberattacks can take many forms, and strong information security governance,
policies, and standards are key to maintaining the company's reputation as a trusted repository of personal
information.

Issue Ratings - Recovery Analysis
Key analytical factors
• TransUnion LLC is the borrower of senior secured credit facility. The facility also benefits from guarantees from its
parent, Transunion Intermediate Holdings Inc. (f/k/a Transunion Corp.), and its material domestic subsidiaries.
• The senior secured credit facility is secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of
TransUnion LLC, and its domestic subsidiaries; and 65% equity interest in TransUnion International Inc. and its
subsidiaries.
• All of TransUnion's debt is senior secured, and we treat it as pari passu in our default scenario analysis.
• Our simulated default scenario contemplates a default in 2024 as a result of a confluence of factors, such as: pricing
pressure from its larger competitors, poor execution on its growth and product initiatives, and a sustained economic
downturn, which impairs margins, cash flows, and business prospects to the extent that the company is unable to
service all of its debt obligations.

Simulated default assumptions
• Simulated year of default: 2024
• EBITDA at emergence: about $420 million
• EBITDA multiple: 6.5x

Simplified waterfall
• Net enterprise value (after 5% administrative costs): about $2.6 billion
• Valuation split in % (obligors/nonobligors) 80/20
• Collateral value available to secured creditors: about $2.4 billion
• First-lien debt: about $4.0 billion
• --Recovery expectations: 50% to 70% (rounded estimate: 65%)
Note: All debt amounts include six months of prepetition interest. Collateral value equals asset pledge from obligors
after priority.
