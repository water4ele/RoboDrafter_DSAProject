Key Risks

Leading positions in construction markets in Central Europe and some
parts of Eastern Europe.

Exposure to the cyclical and competitive construction industry, which is
inherently subject to project risk.

Vertical integration that provides barriers to entry and strategic access
to raw materials.

Volatile free cash flow generation during the year, with sizable seasonal
swings in working capital.

A track record of largely stable operating margins, which indicates
generally good project execution and cost management.

Lower adjusted EBITDA margins compared to industry average, driven
by Strabag's exposure mainly to low risk countries.

High standing in the credit markets and solid perceived financial
stability, underpinned by a reported net cash position.

Sustained capital expenditure (capex), which led to negative
discretionary cash flows in 2018.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on Austria-based construction group Strabag SE reflects S&P Global Ratings' view that the
company will post an adjusted EBITDA margin of around 6%-7% in 2019 and 2020. We think that Strabag has
some headroom in its leverage metrics to absorb some expansionary investments and selected bolt-on
acquisitions. Furthermore, we believe that in 2019-2020 its financial metrics could absorb a likely reversal of the
exceptionally favorable working capital trend that boosted its gross cash in 2017 and 2018. We expect S&P Global
Ratings-adjusted funds from operations (FFO) to debt will comfortably exceed 45%, with adjusted debt to EBITDA
remaining below 2.0x and liquidity staying strong over the next two years.

Downside scenario
We could consider a negative rating action if Strabag's debt-to-EBITDA ratio rises to more than 2.0x and FFO to
debt drops to less than 45% over a sustained period. We believe there is room for a potential weakening of credit
metrics at the current rating level. However, a meaningfully weaker operating performance and materially adverse
trend in working capital needs could constrain the ratings. Rating pressure may also arise from markedly high debt,
owing for instance to sizable acquisitions or increased shareholder returns that are not reflected in our base-case
scenario.

Upside scenario
We could raise the ratings if we observed a track record of materially positive discretionary cash flows, and FFO to
debt and debt to EBITDA were more than 60% and less than 1.5x, respectively. We note that Strabag's financial
metrics during the year are generally significantly weaker, mainly reflecting seasonal working capital requirements.
We expect free operating cash flow (FOCF) to remain fairly weak over the next two years, driven by a reversal of
working capital and still-high capex. We would need to see a material and sustainable improvement in FOCF
before considering an upgrade.

Our Base-Case Scenario

SEPTEMBER 9, 2019 3

Assumptions

• We expect real GDP growth in Germany to slow to
0.6% in 2019 and 1.1% in 2020; in Austria to 1.7% in
2019 and 1.6% in 2020; and in CEE to 3.6% in 2019
and 3.0% in 2020.
• The construction outlook for 2019-2020 shows
slower development than 2018 amid softer
economic expansion. The German building
construction and civil engineering business is
expected to slow compared to 2018, while
construction output in CEE countries should
continue to grow well above GDP in 2019-2020, in
particular in Hungary and Poland.

• We expect output volume to slightly exceed €16
billion in 2019, underpinning 0.0%-0.5% revenue
growth in 2019-2020.
• Operating margins likely to remain stable in the next
few years, with S&P Global Ratings-adjusted
EBITDA margin at 6%-7% and an EBIT margin
around 3.3%.
• A reversal of the positive working capital trend seen
in 2017 and 2018, and still-sustained capex, at
around 4.0% of sales, which will result in negative
FOCF in 2019-2020.
• We anticipate about €100 million for bolt-on
acquisitions annually over the next few years.

Base-case projections
We expect credit metrics to remain strong in 2019-2020, with FFO to debt well above 60%. However, rating headroom
should slightly decrease. We also forecast S&P Global Ratings-adjusted net debt to be zero in 2019. However, a
reversal of the working capital trend of 2017-2018 and still-sustained capex should lead to negative FOCF generation
in 2019-2020. In our base case we incorporate a cash-out from working capital of €400 million-€500 million in 2019,
decreasing to around €200 million-€300 million in 2020, and capex at around 4% of consolidated sales. As a result, we
expect rating headroom to be slightly lower in future.

Company Description
With annual output of about €16.3 billion in 2018, Strabag is one of Europe's largest construction groups. It operates in
following three segments:
• North and West (48% of 2018 output volume with an EBIT margin of 2.2%), mainly including Germany, Poland,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Scandinavia, and the Ground and Hydraulic Engineering segment;

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 9, 2019 4

Strabag SE

• South and East (28% of 2018 output volume with an EBIT margin of 3.1%), mainly including Austria, Switzerland,
the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, south eastern Europe, Russia, and neighboring countries, and the
Environmental Engineering segment; and
• International and Special Divisions (24% of 2018 output volume with an EBIT margin of 5.8%), comprising
International, Tunneling, Construction Materials (except asphalt), Property & Facility Services, Real Estate, and
Infrastructure Development (concessions).
Chart 1

We think the company's medium-term strategy will continue to focus on increasing margins by implementing
cost-efficiency improvements and through the strengthening of risk management policies. We also expect Strabag will
continue to focus on both organic and inorganic growth opportunities, although we understand management does not
see many opportunities outside Europe that meet the group's requirements in terms of risk management and
profitability; therefore, the company will continue to focus mainly on existing markets.
Strabag is publicly listed with a free float of 13.5%. Its core shareholders are Raiffeisen/UNIQA (27.5%), the
Haselsteiner family (26.4%), and Rasperia Trading Ltd. (25.9%). Rasperia is a subsidiary of Basic Element Holding,
which is owned by Russian businessman Mr. Oleg Deripaska. The remaining 6.7% are treasury shares.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
Strabag benefits from leading market positions in the CEE's engineering and construction markets. Strabag's good
order backlog, usually covering about one year of earnings, provides good visibility, although it is smaller than some
peers' mainly reflecting the lower average size of projects. We also consider the company's cost base to be relatively
flexible, which underpins its credit profile.

SEPTEMBER 9, 2019 5

Strabag SE

We assess as positive Strabag's generally effective risk management and lower volatility in profitability metrics than
the industry average over the past few years. Its profitability is slightly below the industry average. This reflects the
competitive landscape in countries and segments where the company operates, but also that its projects are less risky
than those in emerging markets. That said, its strengthening risk management systems and streamlining of parts of the
organization have delivered operational improvements. The reported EBIT margin was 3.7% in 2018, up from 3.3% in
2017. However, adjusting 2018 EBIT for the €55.3 million step-up profit related to the full consolidation of
PANSUEVIA--the German concession company now fully owned by Strabag--EBIT margin would be 3.3%, in line with
2017. Strabag aims to continue posting EBIT margins exceeding 3.3% in 2019, supported by recent risk management
measures and the continued strong contribution from the property and facility services and real estate projects, which
boosted the International and Special Divisions segment's EBIT in 2018.
The industry's above-average risk constrains the group's business risk profile. Fixed-cost contract pricing and the
potential for misjudging project expenses or timing can lead to cost overruns, which are usually the liability of the
contractor. In civil engineering, competitive tenders and large projects with low insight into contract risk and
performance heighten operating risk.

Our peer analysis includes construction companies ACS, Actividades de Construccion y Servicios SA, the largest
construction company in Europe, and VINCI S.A., a diversified infrastructure company with a significant portion of
revenues from more stable concession businesses. Salini Impregilo SpA is a midsize construction company mainly
focused on infrastructure construction contracts, with a substantial presence in the U.S. and high-risk countries.
Strabag is a smaller player compared to ACS and Vinci, and its margins are comparatively lower mainly due to its
revenue concentration in European countries. However, Strabag has historically displayed a consistently lower
leverage compared to rated peers.

Financial Risk: Modest
Strabag's modest financial risk profile reflects its robust balance-sheet structure and relatively strong core credit
metrics. We expect Strabag will maintain careful control over its debt because inherent industry risk can lead to
significant deterioration in metrics in a relatively short period. In our view, the company has strong liquidity and good
financial flexibility, which we regard as positive for its financial risk profile. Strabag's demonstrated ability to obtain
progress payments from customers, which generate working-capital resources, further supports our assessment.
Strabag has displayed a reported net cash position since 2014, which at year-end 2018 stood at about €1.0 billion,
leading to nil adjusted debt. As such, S&P Global Ratings-adjusted debt to EBITDA is nil. We consider such a high net
cash position to be extraordinary and temporary, driven by exceptional working-capital-related cash inflow in 2017
and 2018. We anticipate that this favorable trend of working capital will likely revert in 2019-2020, leading to
significant cash absorption. We believe that capex will be sustained in 2019-2020, at around 4.0% of sales. As a result,
the company's FOCF will likely be fairly weak over the next few years. We also expect that reported operating lease
liabilities post implementation of IFRS 16 in 2019 will be higher than the current adjustment we add to reported debt,
thereby increasing reported and S&P Global Ratings-adjusted net debt. However, we expect adjusted net debt to
remain nil in 2019, then €60 million-€70 million in 2020.
Strabag has a track record of expansionary spending and debt-financed acquisitions. In 2018, Strabag finalized the
acquisition of an additional 50% stake in PANSUEVIA, concession company operating the Ulm-Augsburg section of

the A8 motorway in Germany, in which the company already had a 50% share, and in doing so reached full ownership.

Liquidity: Strong
We consider Strabag's liquidity to be strong and estimate that its liquidity sources will exceed needs by more than 1.5x
in 2019 and 2020. The company enjoys solid relationships with banks. Perceived stability in the financial markets and
prudent financial risk management further support our strong liquidity assessment.

Covenant Analysis
Compliance expectations
Headroom under financial covenants is currently ample and we assume no tightening in our base case.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
Strabag has two bonds outstanding maturing between 2020 and 2022, amounting to €400 million at Dec. 31, 2018. The
bonds represent 29% of total consolidated debt, and are all issued at the parent level. The remaining part of the
financial debt is represented by bank borrowings.

Analytical conclusions
We rate Strabag's notes 'BBB', the same as the issuer credit rating, because we believe that its leverage is sufficiently
low to offset any potential subordination risk.

When calculating our adjusted credit ratios, we add to reported debt €535 million of pension liabilities and €177
million related to capitalized operating leases. Our surplus cash figure incorporates a haircut of about €300 million to
cash and liquid short-term investments, which we believe would not be immediately available for debt repayment. We
do not include on- and off-balance-sheet nonrecourse debt relating to the AKA motorway concessions in Hungary and
to the PANSUEVIA motorway concession in Germany in any of our adjusted leverage ratios. This is because we do
not expect Strabag will provide financial support to these concessions if they are in need.
