Overview
Key Strengths

Key Risks

Large, low decline, oil sands-focused upstream asset
base

Upstream production economics vulnerable to unscheduled production outages, as the
largely fixed cost oil sands operations account for the majority of Suncor's upstream
production

Heavy oil price exposure substantially offset by oil
sands upgrading and downstream refining capacity

High level of discretionary spending reduces financial profile cushion to absorb
unexpected high-impact operational or market shocks

Increasing projected return on capital as spending
trends down to largely maintenance levels

Uncertainty in transportation has factored into a continued WCS differential reducing
prices and net backs.
Relatively high upstream unit production costs due to oil sands-dominant upstream
product mix

Consistent operating performance at oil sands operations, supplemented by production growth from conventional
Canadian and international operations, will support production increases in 2019 and 2020. Our base-case scenario
estimates 2019 production should increase by about 8%, net of Alberta's mandated production curtailment, from the
company's 2018 daily average production of 732,000 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day. Despite the continuation
of Alberta's production curtailment through 2020, we expect Suncor Energy Inc.'s production will continue increasing.
Relatively high upstream unit cash operating costs compared with those of E&P peers focused on conventional oil and
gas development. Based on our estimated unit break-even costs (our estimate of the company's full cycle costs), which
use depreciation, depletion, and amortization as a proxy for finding and development costs, our June 30, 2019
estimate of US$39.74 is the highest among the selected peers. Suncor's cash operating costs are higher than those of its
peers, primarily due to the company's focus on oil sands development and production and costs associated with its
upgrading operations.
Strong revenue generation, supported by the company's light oil-focused upstream product mix and the margin uplift
accruing from its downstream operations, relative to reduced forecast spending, results in increasing annual return on
capital (RoC). S&P Global Ratings' annual projected RoC is estimated to increase and remain above its 2018 calculated
RoC of 10.6%.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects S&P Global Ratings' expectation that Suncor will consistently maintain its five-year
(2017-2021), weighted-average funds from operations (FFO)-to-debt ratio above 45%. Consistently high operating
reliability at the company's oil sands mining projects, improved cash flow generation in its downstream segment,
and continued debt reduction have effectively tempered the potential adverse effects of weak Canadian crude oil
prices. Our base-case scenario assumes continued dividend increases and ongoing share repurchases throughout
our 2019-2021 forecast period, resulting in materially weaker discretionary cash flow (DCF)-to-debt ratios relative
to our previous forecast. Nevertheless, as we expect Suncor's future annual and weighted-average FFO-to-debt
ratios will remain above 45%, we expect the company's cash flow and leverage metrics will continue to support the
'A-' credit rating.

Downside scenario
We expect Suncor's overall business risk profile will not change during our 24-month outlook period, so a negative
rating action would likely occur if the company's cash flow and leverage profile deteriorated relative to our
expectations. If the five-year, weighted-average FFO-to-debt ratio decreased to the bottom end of the 30%-45%
range, with the DCF-to-debt ratio below 10%, and we believed cash flow metrics would remain at these levels, we
would lower the rating to 'BBB+'.

Upside scenario
We believe Suncor's upstream and downstream operations are unlikely to achieve the scale or geographic scope to
support a higher rating, so an upgrade could only occur if the company strengthens and maintains its five-year,
weighted-average FFO-to-debt ratio above 60%. At this level, Suncor's financial risk profile would both support an
'A' rating and accommodate materially lower levels of positive DCF generation. Although we view an upgrade as
unlikely during our outlook period, we believe the company's FFO-to-debt ratios could strengthen above 60% in
the medium term if Suncor can maintain or decrease the full-cycle costs of its upstream segment, while generating
top-quartile return metrics.

Assumptions

• S&P Global Ratings' West Texas Intermediate price
assumptions (published July 29, 2019) of US$55 per
barrel for 2019, through to 2021
• Brent price assumptions of US$60 per barrel in 2019
and 2020, and US$55 per barrel in 2021, published
July 29, 2019
• Natural gas price assumption of US$2.25 per million
British thermal units (Btu) for 2019, US$2.5 per
million Btu for 2020, and US$2.75 per million Btu for
2021 (published July 29, 2019)
• Assumed Western Canadian Select (WCS) discount
of US$20 per barrel for the rest of 2019, 2020, and
2021
• Canadian AECO natural gas price assumption of
US$1.25 per MMBtu for the rest of 2019 and 2020,

• Production growth through the 2019-2021 forecast
period supported by the ramp-up of Fort Hills and
projects in Atlantic Canada and Norway, and an
expectation of alleviation of production curtailments
by 2021
• Production at the company's legacy integrated oil
sands mining project and Fort Hills at 90% of design
capacity, and production levels at the Syncrude
project estimated at 85% of design capacity, with
2019-2020 production lowered to reflect the impact
of mandatory production curtailments in Alberta
• Annual capital spending of C$5.0 billion-C$5.5
billion throughout the 2019-2021 forecast period
• Annual dividend payments of about C$2.5 billion in
2019, increasing throughout the 2019-2021 forecast
period
• Ongoing share repurchases throughout the
2019-2021 forecast period

Base-case projections
Improved revenue and cash flow generation, relative to our previous December 2018 forecast, supported by our
increased crude oil price assumptions, partially offset by Canadian regional price discounts.S&P Global Ratings'
updated cash flow estimates for the 2019-2021 forecast period have increased by about 6% from its December 2018
forecast, largely due to its higher Brent and WTI price assumptions. Higher benchmark prices, the depreciated
Canadian dollar, and increased cash flow contribution from the downstream segment have effectively offset the wider
assumed price discounts for all grades of Canadian crude oil, and reduced 2019 and 2020 oil production due to the
Alberta government's mandated production curtailment.
S&P Global Ratings' projected fully adjusted net debt adversely affected by International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) 16 reporting changes and the depreciated Canadian dollar. Despite the expectation of continued
debt reduction throughout our 2019-2021 forecast period, our estimated 2019 fully adjusted net debt has increased by
about 11% from our 2018 base-case estimate, primarily due to increased reported liabilities under IFRS 16 and the
increased converted U.S. dollar-denominated debt, caused by the depreciated Canadian dollar.
Increasing projected positive free operating cash flow (FOCF) will fund ongoing dividend payments and share
repurchases. Based on our estimates of increasing positive FOCF throughout our 2019-2021 forecast period, we
believe Suncor should be able to fully fund its targeted discretionary spending from generated cash flow and cash on
hand. Therefore, the company's gross debt should not increase as a result of its shareholder-friendly initiatives.
Nevertheless, relatively low levels of forecast DCF tempers the cushion to offset unanticipated adverse, high-impact
operational or market events.

Company Description
Suncor is an integrated oil and gas company with its upstream operations focused on producing synthetic crude oil
and bitumen from its oil sands segment and conventional crude oil. In addition to its large oil sands mining and in-situ
operations (including its 58.74% ownership in the Syncrude project), Suncor's exploration and production (E&P)
segment is involved in offshore operations off the east coast of Canada and in the North Sea. The company also owns
onshore conventional assets in Libya and Syria. There is no production from Syria, and Libya contributes a very small
portion of the company's total production.

The refining and marketing segment refines crude oil and operates an extensive retail network. With Suncor's 462,000
barrels per day of total refining capacity largely configured to process heavy crude feedstock, the high complexity of
the company's refineries, with deep conversion capability, limit the company's exposure to lower value fuel products.
Other assets include four wind projects and an ethanol plant.

Business Risk: Strong
The ratings on Suncor reflect the company's large oil sands-focused resource base, with visibility to multidecade,
non-declining stable production; its integrated portfolio of refineries configured to process heavy crude feedstock; and
our expectation of improving RoC metrics.
We include Suncor's total proven reserves and its probable oil sands reserves in our assessment of the company's
upstream division's business risk profile. This very large resource base is the primary factor supporting our strong
business risk profile assessment. Our adjusted reserves base of 6.3 billion boe, which includes total year-end 2018 net
proven reserves of 4.1 billion boe, and probable oil sands reserves, position the company well relative to 'A' rated E&P
oil and gas companies. Even before considering its probable oil sands reserves, the company's 4.1 billion boe proven
reserves base is one of the largest in the North American E&P investment-grade rated peer group, exceeded by only
Conoco Phillips, Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNRL), and Chevron Corp. Moreover, its proved developed (PD)
reserve life index (RLI) of about 12.8 years provides visibility to low-risk stable production. This very long PD RLI is
characteristic of the company's oil sands-focused upstream operations, and materially exceeds that of its E&P peers
focused on conventional oil and gas development. Among its investment-grade North American peers, only CNRL's

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 25, 2019 8

Suncor Energy Inc.

18.2-year PD RLI is larger, also reflecting CNRL's large exposure to oil sands (both mining and thermal) development.
Chart 4

The high portion of oil sands production in Suncor's upstream product mix results in relatively high consolidated U.S.
dollar-equivalent unit cash operating and break-even costs of about US$25.76 and US$39.74 per boe at June 30, 2019,
respectively. Given the high fixed component associated with oil sands production (both mining and in-situ),
production shortfalls, caused by scheduled or unscheduled outages, will materially increase oil sands production unit
cash operating costs. If Suncor is able to maintain high operating reliability at its oil sands operations, its unit cash
operating costs should benefit from increasing economies of scale, as synthetic and bitumen crude oil production is
sustained at consistent levels.
Despite the relatively high cash costs associated with oil sands production, Suncor's profitability, which we assess
based on our calculated RoC for the consolidated company, benefits from both the upstream segment's improved
operating reliability and the company's integrated downstream operations. Our assessment of Suncor's five-year
(2017-2021) RoC, at 10.5%, ranks the company's profitability at the higher end of the midrange of the global integrated
oil and gas peer group. As we expect the company will continue to generate high levels of positive free operating cash
flow, its annual RoC should continue to strengthen.

Financial Risk: Intermediate
Our financial risk profile assessment for Suncor is unchanged. Despite our expectation of ongoing share repurchases,
and continued dividend increases, the company's financial risk profile remains commensurate with an intermediate
assessment. Our updated cash flow forecast for the 2019-2021 period estimates about a 6% increase in total FFO
relative to our previous December 2018 forecast, with annual RoC increasing throughout this period.
Increased estimated cash flow generation over our 2019-2021 forecast period, and the expectation of continued debt
reduction during this period, despite a small offsetting increase in our projected capital spending estimates for
2019-2021, have strengthened our five-year (2017-2021) fully adjusted FFO-to-debt ratio. With our updated five-year
weighted average FFO-to-debt ratio estimated in the 46%-48% range, and our projected annual FFO-to-debt ratio
continuing to improve beyond 2019, we believe the company's cash flow and leverage profile should accommodate
continued dividend increases and ongoing share repurchases. Although our projected fully adjusted annual net debt
amounts have been adversely affected by both our Canada-U.S. foreign exchange rate assumptions and the
reclassification of some leasing obligations under the IFRS 16 lease accounting rules, we expect Suncor will continue
reducing debt over our forecast period; therefore, we expect its financial risk profile should remain fairly stable over
the next two-three years.

Liquidity: Strong
We assess Suncor's liquidity profile as strong. Our assessment reflects the projected increase in cash flow generation
and capital spending largely focused on sustaining existing operations. Our muted spending estimates are, however,

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 25, 2019 12

Suncor Energy Inc.

offset by our expectation of high levels of discretionary spending in the upcoming 24 months. Nevertheless, under our
crude oil and natural gas price assumptions, we estimate that cash flow from operations would fully fund the
company's capital program during our 24-month liquidity assessment period. Specifically, we estimate Suncor's ratio of
total liquidity sources relative to projected uses at about 1.5x in the 12-month period beginning July 1, 2019, and at
about 1.9x in the subsequent 12 months.
Our liquidity assessment also incorporates the following assumptions:
• Suncor's net sources of liquidity (after satisfying all funding requirements) will remain positive, even if its EBITDA
declines 30%
• The company will retain its good standing in capital markets and a good relationship with its banking syndicate
• With Suncor having only one debt-to-capital covenant, we believe there is no likelihood of a covenant breach during
the next two years
Our short-term and global scale commercial paper (CP) ratings on the company are 'A-2', and the Canada scale CP
rating is 'A-1(Low)'. These ratings reflect our expectation that Suncor will maintain available same-day back-stop
facilities to cover 100% of all CP maturities as they come due.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Projected annual FFO of C$10 billion-C$11 billion

• Annual capital spending of C$5.0 billion-C$5.5
billion in the liquidity assessment period

• Total availability of C$6.9 billion under the
company's credit facilities at June 30, 2019
• Cash on hand of about C$2.1 billion at June 30, 2019

• The repayment of upcoming debt maturities
• Annual dividend payments of C$2.5 billion-C$2.6
billion
• Share repurchases of C$1.5 billion-C$2 billion

Environmental, Social, And Governance

The oil and gas industry has high exposure to environmental and social risks due to the production of greenhouse
gas creating commodities, the potential environmental damage caused by its operations and the environmental
and social risks in the supply chain, most notably the protracted delays in completing new pipeline projects
We view the environmental considerations that have mostly triggered ongoing social activism against pipeline
development and oil sands production to be less supportive of credit quality for Canadian oil and gas companies
focused on oil sands development relative to the broader oil and gas sector. With 93% of its 2018 production from
Canada and about 86% of its projected 2019 production coming from its oil sands (mining and in-situ) operations,
Suncor is highly exposed to stringent environmental regulations, conflicting provincial regulations, and Indigenous
activism. Protracted delays in constructing pipelines have led to wide hydrocarbon differentials for the industry,
which have adversely affected revenue and profitability for oil and gas companies. In our view, the pervasive and
persistent challenges to pending pipeline expansion projects have created a structural disadvantage for Canadian
E&P companies, as constrained egress capacity from western Canada has translated into significant price discounts
for several grades of Canadian crude, particularly heavy oil. Suncor's upgrading and refining capacity does insulate
its production from the prevailing volatile price discounts for Canadian heavy oil; however, the company's revenue
and overall profitability remain vulnerable to persistent price discounts for its lighter crudes sold into the open
market.
In addition to Canada's clearly defined emissions reduction policies, environmental regulations in the North Sea,
U.K., are also well defined, covering abandonment and reclamation (asset retirement obligations), oil spills, and
emissions, among other items. Suncor has negligible exposure to Libya and changes to the environmental
regulatory framework would not have a meaningful impact on the company.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
We expect the capital structure will include committed credit facilities and senior unsecured debt. At June 30, 2019,
there was total debt outstanding of C$15.2 billion.

Analytical conclusions
All debt, including the committed revolving credit facilities, and CP outstanding, is unsecured. Given there are no
material priority obligations ranking ahead of the company's senior unsecured obligations, we rate Suncor's senior
unsecured debt 'A-', at the same level as the issuer credit rating.
