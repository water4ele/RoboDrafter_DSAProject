Overview
Key Strengths

Key Risks

One of the largest U.S. apparel companies, with a portfolio of strong and
diverse brands

Participation in a very fragmented and competitive apparel
industry

Solid and consistent cash-flow generation

Exposure to foreign-currency headwinds

Conservative financial policies

Portfolio rationalization remains the company's top priority. Over the past two years, the company acquired
Williamson-Dickie, Icebreaker, and Altra. It also divested Nautica, Reef, and Van Moer, and it completed the spin-off of
Kontoor Brands. We expect the company will continue to actively manage its portfolio of brands to operate with
greater speed and agility, strengthen its position in faster-growing categories, and strengthen its margin profile. We
believe the company has made substantial progress in these areas with its recent portfolios changes, which should
enhance operational performance.
The EBITDA margin should remain above the industry average. The company's brands resonate well with customers
because of its ability to continually innovate and deliver products on trend. The company is transitioning to a
consumer- and retail-centric operating model, which will help it meet consumers' needs across all channels. Its
effective marketing strategy and its pricing and purchasing power will allow it to maintain solid EBITDA margin at
about 18% over the next one to two years. Increasing market volatility and the uncertain geopolitical environment,
especially with regard to tariff increases on goods sourced from China, are risks that should be manageable and not
significantly affect the company's profitability given its well-diversified supplier base.
We believe the company will maintain its historically disciplined financial policy and conservative balance sheet as it
continues to focus on making bolt-on acquisitions. Following the recent spin-off of Kontoor Brands, the company used
a portion of the proceeds to repay about $600 million of short-term borrowings. We expect the company to maintain
conservative financial policies, and while it will likely pursue bolt-on acquisitions and leverage could temporarily
exceed 2x, we expect the company will prioritize debt reduction and will reduce leverage below 2x.

VF Corp.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our view that VF Corp. will manage its leverage at 1.5x-2.0x as it continues to pursue
bolt-on acquisitions. Leverage could temporarily increase above 2.0x; however, we expect the company will
demonstrate financial discipline and bring leverage back toward the mid-1x area in 12-18 months following an
acquisition.

Downside scenario
We could lower the ratings if VF Corp's strategic and financial policy becomes more aggressive and the company
engages in more shareholder-friendly activities, or if it pursues aggressive debt-financed acquisitions such that
leverage increases to and stays above 2.0x. In addition, we could lower the ratings if the margin profile of VF
Corp.'s businesses deteriorates due to an unexpected rise in input costs such that the company is unable to pass
them on to customers, or competitive pressures such that debt to EBITDA increases above 2.0x for an extended
period.

Upside scenario
An upgrade is unlikely over the next one to two years given its acquisition strategy, but over the longer term, one
could result from the company further strengthening its market position while successfully managing its brands in
the highly competitive apparel sector, thus improving margins and maintaining debt leverage below 1.5x.

Our Base-Case Scenario

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 9, 2019 3

VF Corp.

Assumptions

• U.S. GDP growth of 2.5% and 1.8% in 2019 and
2020, respectively, and a global GDP growth rate of
about 3% over the next two years will support the
company's global expansion and top-line growth.
• Revenues for fiscal 2020 (ending March 30, 2020)
will decrease by about 15% from 2019 levels due to
the spin-off of the Jeanswear segment, offset to
some extent by strength in core brands and digital
and international platforms driving overall growth.
Beyond fiscal 2020, we expect revenues to grow
in-line with the GDP growth rate.

A--Actual. E—Estimate.

• We expect the EBITDA margin to improve by about
100 basis points toward mid-18% over the next two
years, driven by an ongoing mix shift toward
higher-margin businesses and stronger selling,
general, and administrative leverage with the
phasing of restructuring charges partially offset by
dis-synergies from the Kontoor separation.
• Capital expenditures (capex) of about $400 million
in fiscal 2020, primarily due to infrastructure
investments, with capex to normalize to about $300
million thereafter.
• Free operating cash flow of slightly below $1 billion
in fiscal 2020 and increasing to about $1.1 billion in
2021.
• Cash dividends of about $700 million and share
repurchases of about $400 million-$500 million over
the next two years.

Base-case projections
Sales growth and margins will remain healthy. Continued momentum in the company's The North Face and Vans
brands, solid performance in international markets, and its direct-to-consumer segment will support stable revenue
growth, despite ongoing challenges in the U.S. wholesale segment.

Company Description
VF Corp. is one of the largest designers and manufacturers of branded lifestyle apparel footwear and related products.

VF Corp.

Business Risk: Strong
VF Corp. maintains a leading position as one of the largest U.S. apparel companies, with pro forma revenue of a little
less than $12 billion for fiscal 2020 (ending March 30, 2020). The company will continue to have solid positions in the
outdoor, active, and work lifestyle segments and maintain a portfolio of well-diversified and recognized brands, which
include Vans, The North Face, Timberland, Kipling, and Williamson-Dickie. The company will also continue to benefit
from diversified distribution channels, strong product development capability, efficient global supply chain, and pricing
and purchasing power (in part because of its innovative fabric), all of which have enabled it to generate above-average
margins and profitability.

Peer comparison
Selected rated peers for VF Corp. include PVH Corp., Ralph Lauren Corp., and NIKE Inc. All these peers have good
product, channel, and geographic diversification. However, PVH's business relies heavily on its Tommy Hilfiger and
Calvin Klein brands, while Ralph Lauren's brand portfolio is predominantly related to the Ralph Lauren name. Also,
both these companies are smaller in scale than VF Corp. NIKE, with revenues of nearly $40 billion, is the largest seller
of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, and accessories.
NIKE and Ralph Lauren's credit measures are stronger, with leverage below 1x and about 1x, respectively. PVH's
leverage is about 3x, but we expect leverage could increase toward 4x for an acquisition. The company, however,
would be able to reduce leverage below 4x shortly after the acquisition.

Financial summary
VF Corp. continues to demonstrate conservative financial policies, including a balanced approach to pursuing ongoing
bolt-on acquisitions while keeping leverage within stated targets by prudently managing shareholder returns. We
believe VF Corp. will manage its leverage at 1.5x-2.0x. Although we believe it will pursue bolt-on acquisitions, and
leverage could temporarily increase above 2.0x, we expect the company will demonstrate financial discipline and
deemphasize its share repurchases in order to bring leverage back toward the mid-1x area.

Liquidity: Strong
The short-term rating on VF Corp. is 'A-1', and we assess its liquidity as strong, reflecting our forecast that the
company's sources of cash will exceed its uses by about 2x over the next 12 months, and about 2.5x for the following
12 months. We expect that sources will continue exceeding uses even if EBITDA declines by 30%. We believe the
company has well-established and solid relationships with banks and high standing in credit markets, as unsecured
notes currently trade at a premium. We expect VF Corp. will have the ability to weather market turbulence without
refinancing and also has generally prudent risk management, as the revolver and cash balances demonstrate
management's planning to ensure strong, but not exceptional, liquidity throughout its seasonal operating cycle.
Furthermore, we expect the company will be in compliance with its maximum debt-to-capital covenant.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Cash of $606 million as of June 29, 2019;

• Seasonal working-capital requirement of about $700
million per year;

• Availability of $2.2 billion under its $2.25 billion
revolving credit facility expiring December 2023;
and
• Forecast cash funds from operations of about $1.4
billion-$1.5 billion over the next two years.

• Capex of about $400 million over the next 12
months, normalizing to $260 million annually
thereafter;
• Dividends of about $700 million per year; and
• We exclude share repurchases from our liquidity
calculation, as we consider these discretionary in
nature.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
The company's capital structure consists of senior unsecured notes and a senior unsecured global revolving credit
facility. All notes are issued by VF Corp., and the revolving credit facility is co-issued by VF Corp. and a few
international subsidiaries, giving the company liquidity in its foreign markets. All debt is issued pari passu.

Analytical conclusions
With no material priority obligations ranking ahead of VF Corp.'s senior unsecured obligations, we rate all senior
unsecured debt 'A', the same as the issuer credit rating.
