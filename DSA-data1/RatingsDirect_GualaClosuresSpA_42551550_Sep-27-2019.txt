Overview
Key Strengths

Key Risks

Stable end markets with growth opportunities in Eastern Europe, the
Americas, and Asia.

Limited size and product diversity.

Value-added products and pricing discipline support strong profit margins.

Exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations, especially in Argentina.
Possible improvement in cash flows relies on strict working capital
management.

Guala Closures' strong geographic footprint, market position, long-standing customer relationships, and leading brand
underpin the company's growth platform.These factors allow Guala Closures to support its clients' expansion into
higher growth markets, such as Eastern Europe, the Americas, and India.
We expect Guala Closures' EBITDA margin to return to historical levels in the medium-term. After 2018's exceptional
costs, related to the listing of the company on the Milan Stock Exchange, we expect EBITDA margins to gradually
recover. We do not expect substantial exceptional costs to recur. That said, we foresee some EBITDA margin dilution
during 2019 due to the consolidation of United Closures and Plastics Ltd., acquired in December 2018.

Outlook: Positive

The positive outlook indicates that we could raise the long-term issuer credit rating on Guala Closures to 'BB-' in
the next 12 months if cash flow generation improved materially on a sustainable basis. We expect a reduction in
working capital outflows to be the main driver of this improvement.

Downside scenario
We could revise our outlook to stable if Guala Closures' FOCF remained weak, most likely due to ongoing large
working capital outflows. We could also revise the outlook to stable if Guala Closures' credit metrics failed to
improve over the next 12 months.

Upside scenario
We could raise our rating if Guala Closures successfully stemmed its working capital outflows, free operating cash
flow (FOCF) to debt improved to above 5%, and funds from operations (FFO) to debt sustainably improved to
above 16%. We would also expect the company to adopt a financial policy that supports such credit metrics.

Our Base-Case Scenario

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 27, 2019 3

Guala Closures SpA

Assumptions

• GDP growth in Europe (56% of sales) of 1.1% for
2019 and 1.4% for 2020. In the Americas (19% of
sales), we expect GDP growth of 1.0% for 2019 and
2.0% in 2020. In Asia (15% of sales), we expect
annual GDP growth of 7.0% in 2019 and 7.1% in
2020. The majority of Guala Closures' sales in Asia
relate to India and China.

• Annual organic revenue growth of 3.7% in 2019 and
4.4% in 2020, in line with local GDP growth rates.
• S&P Global Ratings adjusted EBITDA margins at
about 19%. Margins would be supported by stable
contribution from high-margin closures, a strong
pricing discipline, and no sizeable exceptional costs,
after the listing-related costs in 2018. Margins would
be undermined, especially during 2019, by the
consolidation of UCP.
• Annual capital expenditure (capex) at about 5.5% of
revenue for 2019-2020. This is broadly in line with
historical capex levels.
• Tax payments of about €24 million per year.
• Annual working capital outflows between €3 million
and €7 million over 2019 and 2020, on improved
inventories and payables.
• Annual dividend payments of €6 million over
2019-2023, primarily for minority shareholders.
• No significant acquisitions.

Base-case projections
The company experienced significant working capital outflows in 2017 and 2018 due to increase in inventories, the
payment of Space4's trade payables, and the consolidation of UCP, Guala Closures' latest acquisition. From 2019, we
expect the normalization of Guala Closures' working capital pattern through inventory management, along with
improved trade payables, will support the company's FOCF generation. That said, foreign exchange fluctuations could
offset the improvement of the cash flow generation.
We expect a slight improvement in Guala Closures' key credit measures over 2019-2020. The refinancing in 2018
extended Guala Closures' debt maturities and lowered the cost of its debt, the full benefit of which will come through in
2019. We forecast FOCF to debt to improve to about 6% by year-end 2019.

We assume no acquisitions, although we do not rule them out. The bottle closures market remains fragmented. Guala
Closures has actively participated in market consolidation via small acquisitions of niche, market-leading, local players,
which it has successfully integrated with a limited effect on leverage. We think acquisitions will be a part of Guala
Closures' growth strategy, but we do not incorporate any transformational acquisitions in our base case at this stage.

Company Description
Guala Closures is an Italy-based producer of aluminum and nonrefillable closures. The company had revenue of €543
million in 2018. Guala Closures primarily derives revenue from the sale of safety closures (42%), roll-on closures (29%),
and wine bottle closures (19%). Guala Closures has been listed on the Milan Stock Exchange (STAR segment) since
August 2018.

Business Risk: Fair
Guala Closures is the leading player in the market of specialty closures for spirits and wines. It has a 60% market share
in safety closures for spirits and produces about 30% of all wine screwcaps, a growing market.
Guala Closures is geographically well diversified, in terms of both revenue and assets. Revenue is split between Europe
(56%), the Americas (19%), Asia (15%), Oceania (8%), and Africa (3%). Its production plants are spread across all five
continents.
Growth opportunities are stronger in Latin America and Asia. These emerging markets are characterized by growing
demand for spirits and higher counterfeiting risk. In general, we expect Guala Closures to benefit from the increasing
penetration of screw caps for wine bottles and the premiumization of mineral water products and bottles.
Guala Closures' strong EBITDA margins also support our business risk assessment. These margins largely reflect the
patent-protected nature of the company's safety closures (42% of sales), as well as other key products, such as
value-added wine caps and customized luxury closures. Although the company does not have any contractual
pass-through provisions, historically it has successfully passed cost increases on to customers in annual contract
renegotiations, albeit with some delay.
Our business risk assessment also reflects Guala Closures' limited end-market and product diversity. Revenue mainly
relates to spirits (63%) and wines (19%); non-alcoholic beverages, oil and vinegar, and pharmaceutical products only
account for 18% of revenue.

Guala Closures is smaller than its peers, and it focuses primarily on the narrower wine and spirits segment. Its stronger
EBITDA margins (19%-20%) reflect the value-added nature of its products. This contrasts with most peers, which are
larger and serve a wider range of end-markets (such as food, personal care, and hygiene). However, their products
tend to be more commoditized, resulting in lower EBITDA margins (15% on average).
At 6.6% of revenue, Guala Closures' capex-to-revenue ratio is the highest among the selected peers. This mainly
relates to recent investments in capacity increase and new products. Guala Closures allocates 60% of its capex to
expansion projects, such as new facilities, new product developments, and technological expansion. The remaining
40% relates to maintenance.

Financial Risk: Aggressive
We expect EBITDA growth and a reduction in leverage will fuel an improvement in the company's credit metrics.
In 2018, working capital needs increased by €15 million, primarily due to a reduction in trade payables as a result of
the merger into Space4 S.p.A. Unfavorable FX movements--particularly translation impact in the company's Argentine
operations--also harmed cash flow.
We expect a reduction in working capital outflows in 2019 due to tighter working capital management. Cash flow will
benefit from reduced interest expenses due to Guala Closures' refinancing in 2018. However, the ongoing devaluation
of the Argentine peso is likely to partly offset this.
As a listed company, Guala Closures aims to reduce its net debt to EBITDA to 3.0x-3.5x on a reported basis, as well as
on an adjusted basis. We expect Guala Closures to achieve this via debt repayments through cash generation.

Liquidity: Adequate
We assess Guala Closures' liquidity as adequate and estimate liquidity sources to exceed liquidity uses by more than
2.0x over the next two years. An adequate cash balance and availabilities under Guala Closures' €80 million revolving
credit facility (RCF) support our assessment of the company's liquidity position. The company has no major debt
maturities before 2024.

Principal liquidity sources over the 12 months from June 30, 2019
• Cash balance of about €37 million;
• Availability of €66 million under the €80 million RCF maturing in 2024; and
• Forecast cash FFO of €65 million-€70 million.

Principal liquidity uses over the same period
• Working capital outflows of €5 million;
• Dividends of about €6 million;
• Debt repayments of about €7 million ; and
• Capex of €34 million to €36 million.

Debt maturities
As of June 30, 2019, Guala Closures' main debt maturities were:
• 2024: €455 million (senior secured notes); and
• 2024: €13.4 million (drawings under €80 million RCF at June 30, 2019).

Covenant Analysis
Compliance expectations
The documentation of the €80 million RCF includes a springing senior net leverage cap of 6.4x, which only applies if
the drawings under the RCF exceed 40%. As of year-end 2018, S&P Global Ratings adjusted leverage ratio was 4.5x
and we do not expect the RCF to be drawn in excess of 40% in our base case.

Issue Ratings - Recovery Analysis
Key analytical factors
• Our issue rating and the recovery rating on the €455 million senior secured notes due 2024 are 'B+' and '4',
respectively. The recovery rating reflects meaningful recovery prospects of 30%-50% (rounded estimate: 40%). The
rating is supported by the low level of senior secured debt and constrained by prior ranking liabilities (comprising an
€80 million super senior RCF and local debt facilities).
• Our hypothetical default scenario assumes pressures on revenue and profitability stemming from customer losses to
competitors and rising raw material prices, which the company is not able to pass on to customers.
• We value Guala Closures on a going concern basis, given its leading market shares in specialty closures and its
long-standing customer relationships.

Simulated default assumptions
• Year of default: 2023
• Jurisdiction: Italy

Simplified waterfall
• Emergence EBITDA: €60 million (maintenance capex assumed at 4.5% of revenues, cyclicality adjustment of
5%--standard for the packaging sector)
• Distressed EBITDA multiple: 5.0x
• Gross recovery value: €300 million
• Net recovery value after administrative expenses (5%): €285 million
• Estimated priority claims (RCF and other facilities): €87.6 million
• Remaining recovery value: €197.4 million
• Senior secured debt claims: €468.7 million*
• Recovery range: 30%-50% (rounded estimate: 40%)
• Recovery rating: 4
*All debt amounts include six months' prepetition interest.
