Overview

Key Risks

Regulators are now more sympathetic to the distressed nature of
nuclear power production and have approved zero emission credit
(ZEC) revenues in New Jersey, New York, and Illinois.

Base-load generation is subject to considerable energy margin variability,
reflecting low natural gas prices, the growing availability of renewable
power, demand, and changes in weather.

Ability to advocate for market design changes has become, in our
view, a successful part of its business strategy.

Because of its higher fixed-cost structure and its nuclear plants, margins in
the past three years have been narrower than those of its peers.

A proactive hedging strategy, and cash flow from wholesale
generation is significantly hedged over the next two years.

Low gas prices affect marginal costs of production, hurting price-taking
base-load generation the most. Declining fuel prices also affect capacity
prices negatively if energy margin offsets are high.

We estimate that about 94% of expected output is hedged in 2019,
falling to around 42% of output in 2021.

Energy efficiency and behind-the-meter distributed generation slows or
reduces demand growth, widening reserve margins and negatively
influencing market heat rates, which affect power prices.

Free operating cash flow (FOCF) is sufficient to help cut about $2.5
billion in debt by 2022.
We expect adjusted FOCF to debt will remain positive in the next
few years despite lower gas prices.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on Exelon Generation Co. LLC (ExGen) mirrors those on parent Exelon Corp. because of
ExGen's core status to Exelon. That status implies the ratings on ExGen are supported by and linked to Exelon.
The stable outlook also reflects our expectations that Exelon's lower-risk utility operations and less volatile
zero-emissions credits (ZECs) will consistently reflect about 75% of consolidated EBITDA. While the issuer rating
on ExGen is predicated on Exelon maintaining adjusted funds from operations (FFO) to debt at more than 19%, in
order for ExGen to maintain a 'bbb' stand-alone credit profile (SACP), we expect it to maintain adjusted FFO to
debt of at least 35%. ExGen's FFO to debt was about 34% in 2017, but ZEC revenues and lower leverage improved
the figure to about 40% in 2018.

Downside scenario
We could revise the outlook to negative if Exelon's adjusted consolidated FFO to debt fell to less than 19%. We
could also take a negative rating action if Exelon's management of regulatory risk weakens or if its regulated
utilities and ZECs do not consistently account for about 75% of its consolidated EBITDA. Moreover, gross margins
could come under pressure if power prices continue to decline because of weak natural gas prices or lower market
heat rates.
We would lower the SACP of ExGen if its adjusted FFO to debt were consistently below 33%. We believe ExGen's
SACP could come under pressure from depressed capacity prices, as higher than expected natural gas production
encourages incremental gas-fired generation entry. We also see the prospects of a lower SACP if widening reserve
margins cause implied forward market heat rates to decline or if energy margins decline as more renewable power
sources come online. Given that power prices are still under pressure and forward EBITDA is backdated, these
remain possibilities if ExGen does not reduce its debt. However, we expect to see ExGen's free cash flow
generation to cut about $2.5 billion of net debt at ExGen and Exelon through 2022. A change in ExGen's SACP,
however, will still not result in an immediate change in its issuer ratings if Exelon's growing utility segment can
sustain the group's credit profile.

Upside scenario
Although less likely, we could raise the ratings over the next two years if FFO to debt consistently improved to
greater than 24%, without increasing the company's business risk. We would expect to raise the SACP of ExGen if
its adjusted FFO to debt is consistently 40% or more. Such a scenario could stem from an improved economy,
higher electricity prices, and/or a robust increase in the rate base of Exelon's regulated utility subsidiaries. Energy
price reforms that strengthens the Pennsylvania-Jersey-Maryland (PJM) Interconnection market could also
contribute to better credit quality.

Company Description
Exelon Generation Co. LLC is one of the largest merchant power generators in the U.S. and among the largest power
service providers in the county, with more than 32 gigawatts (GW) of owned generation capacity, and over 140 TWh
of retail load. As such, the company enjoys significant regional diversity, participating in the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic,
Texas, New York, and New England markets, as well as the Canadian, U.S. South and West markets (usually grouped
because of the smaller exposure)"

Business Risk: Satisfactory
ExGen's unregulated operations constitute about 35% of the consolidated enterprise in terms of cash flow and capital
spending. We expect that to decline to 30% by 2021 due to an increase in regulated growth and weaker cash flows
from unregulated businesses. Over the past 24 months, ExGen's SACP has been influenced by depressed energy and
capacity markets, and the absence of pricing signals that adequately compensate base-load generation. Compared with
its peers, ExGen's cash flow is more sensitive to commodity prices because about 70% of its generation, including

AUGUST 16, 2019 4

Exelon Generation Co. LLC

purchased power, is nuclear. Unlike gas-fired assets, which have a lower cost structure, nuclear plants face narrowing
margins because of lower market heat rates and weak energy prices. Specifically, ExGen's business risk profile is
influenced by the following factors:
• The proliferation of wind generation assets. Renewable energy such as wind displaces base-load generation during
low-demand periods and could cause negative power prices. Renewable energy can also erode scarcity pricing
periods, which are essential for base-load assets like nuclear units to earn a reasonable return.
• Low gas prices affect marginal costs of production, hurting price-taking base-load generation the most. Declining
fuel prices also affect capacity prices negatively if energy margin offsets are high.
• Energy efficiency and behind-the-meter distributed generation slows or reduces demand growth, widening reserve
margins and negatively influencing market heat rates, which affect power prices.
Hedging is a necessity, especially for a large base-load generator like ExGen. Falling natural gas prices harm ExGen
more than its peers because a large proportion of its generation is from base-load nuclear generation, all of which
declining natural gas prices affect.
The company undertakes ratable hedging largely to bring predictability to future cash flows, which otherwise would be
extremely volatile. The chart below shows the impact of mark-to-market value of hedges on its open gross margin for
the year.

Open gross margins are under continual onslaught from a weak power market environment (note that 2018's open

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

AUGUST 16, 2019 5

Exelon Generation Co. LLC

gross margins were higher mostly because they now include ZEC revenues). In contrast, since 2015, hedged margins
have been fairly resilient. Because the company needs to hedge its large generation, it needs to bring volumes ratably
into the market, which it does in a measured fashion.

Also, ExGen's hedged gross margin range expectation (unlike chart 1, the margins presented in chart 3 include power
and non-power new business expectations) is fairly narrow for 2018, but expands in future years. The broader gross
margin range in 2020 and 2021 is a result of higher future unhedged exposure, and uncertainty over power prices, due
to volatile natural gas prices.

AUGUST 16, 2019 6

Exelon Generation Co. LLC

From a ratings perspective, a 5% stress to expected gross hedged margin indicates a floor level for gross margins (see
chart 3). This represents the gross margin expectation at a 95% confidence interval, meaning expected gross margins
will be lower than this value only if power prices decline more than two standard deviations from current levels. The
50% case would be the expected gross margin (statistically, the "mean"). Similarly, a 95% case represents gross margin
expectations if power prices moved up by two standard deviations. From a ratings perspective, we focus on the 5%
stress as it indicates a floor under a falling price scenario.
We note the following:
• Outer years have larger bands as hedged levels are lower.
• Under a "backwardated" (i.e., future expected earnings are lower than the current year) pricing environment, the
95% case has fallen each quarter as progressive volumes were hedged at lower levels.
• The company did well in protecting its floor gross margins (5% case) even under a backwardated pricing
environment because power pricing did not move down by more than two standard deviations during the year.
• However, gross margins floors have continually declined in the outer years due to the continuing onslaught on
power prices (and gross margins) from distributed generation, renewable proliferation, and lower natural gas prices.
Hedging also has limitations. As a "price taking" business, a baseload merchant generator like ExGen neither controls
the prompt price of power nor the shape of the forward price curve. It faces backwardated gross margins as old hedges
come off and they can only roll generation into lower priced hedges. Still, a ratable hedging strategy does provide
insulation from near-term market forces. In a market that is seeing volatile swings, hedging future production

potentially allows time to revise capital structures that are compatible with the evolving commodity dynamics.
ExGen has been able to successfully advocate for changes in market design, which is factored in its business risk profile.
We note that the company's gross margin floor expectations had fallen meaningfully for 2019 (see chart 3). The uplift
in margins across the board from the fourth quarter of 2016 represent the ZEC revenues.
We consider ExGen's ability to advocate for changes to market design as an inherent part of its business strategy and
an area in which the company has been successful. As a consequence of commodity price decline and renewable
penetration, an increasing number of ExGen's nuclear plants have reported negative cash flow as a consequence of low
commodity prices and the more available renewable energy. Even as cash flows weakened, however, the company has
successfully argued for statutory relief for its beleaguered units, citing environmental, fuel diversity, and reliability
concerns. Regulators are also now more sensitive to the nuclear industry's distress and have approved ZEC revenues
for ExGen's nuclear plants in Illinois, New York, and most recently in New Jersey (Clinton, Quad Cities, Fitzpatrick,
Ginna, Nine-Mile Point, and Salem). By our estimates, the Illinois, New Jersey, and New York ZECs boost ExGen's
revenues by about $630 million. We do not think any developments are likely in Pennsylvania, where ExGen owns 4.5
GW of nuclear generation (3.6 GW after the 837 MW Three Mile Island closes down later this year), until at least 2020.
Retail operations provide a natural hedge. ExGen generates a significant portion of earnings from its retail operations.
Through retail and wholesale channels, ExGen provided nearly 212 TWh of load in 2018, or nearly 5% of total U.S.
power demand. We expect a similar level in 2019, although this could be lower after 2019 when some nuclear plants
close down. In an environment where there is a continunal squeeze on margins in wholesale generation, it's imperative
for merchant companies to find a home for their owned-generation. ExGen has increasingly done so using its retail
power business. Even as residential retail contracts are typically only 18 to 24 months long, while commercial
customers usually sign for two-and-a-half years, retail business has become vital to the stability and predictability of
cash flows, recontracting risks notwithstanding. Constellation's total load served has remained constant over the past
three years post retail acquisitions. The brand is currently a market leader in commercial and industrial (C&I) load
served and about fourth nationally in residential load served.
Exelon has expanded its retail business and improved its load-to-generation mix to the point where the total retail and
wholesale load served has grown by about 8% in the past three years. The retail load provides a natural hedge against
backwardation. During periods of high volatility, generation availability provides backstop to load portfolio; during
periods of low volatility, ExGen is able to capture higher margins through lower cost to serve to its customers and also
optimize the value of its dispatchable fleet.

AUGUST 16, 2019 8

In most locations, ExGen has adequate intermediate and peaking capacity for managing load-shaping risks. However,
we believe the company will still need to buy and sell generation in the market to manage its portfolio needs, which
exposes it to considerable commodity risk. Moreover, ExGen has a significant open position in the Midwest to
merchant markets, though a somewhat tighter position in the Mid-Atlantic and New England, where it risks finding
itself short when loads and power prices are high. In particular, ExGen's load-to-generation matching in the Midwest is
just 36%, and a better 71% matching in the Mid-Atlantic.
We estimate current hedged levels of expected generation at about 94%, 72%, and 42%, for 2019, 2020, and 2021,
respectively. These hedges mitigate near-term exposure to commodity markets and demonstrate the significant value
of ExGen's hedging program. Even though these hedges insulate ExGen, they also show the sensitivity of ExGen's
margins to the prospect of continued shale gas production. The merchant generation margins at ExGen could decrease
as higher-priced hedges expire, which is evident in the drop in wholesale hedged gross margins. We note that the
second quarter 2019 mark-to-market values of hedges is $1.3 billion compared to almost $350 million in 2018. Still,
retail provides potential for further growth. We believe retail contributions can mitigate the wholesale decline, given
the potential for cost savings, growth in retail volumes, and acquisitions.

Financial Risk: Intermediate
Given that base-load generation is price-taking by nature, we expect ExGen's adjusted FFO to debt to remain volatile
relative to its peers. For instance, we estimate gross margins in 2020 will be lower by about $225 million for every $5
per megawatt hour (round-the-clock) decline in power prices, and nearly $275 million lower for every $1 per million
Btu decline in 2019 natural gas prices.

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

AUGUST 16, 2019 9

Exelon Generation Co. LLC

Because of the decline in commodity prices, we expect ExGen's stand-alone adjusted FFO to debt ratio to hover near
40% in 2019, which we view as high for its 'bbb' SACP. Even as the company's cash flows are more volatile than those
of its peers because of the larger proportion of base-load generation and significant fixed costs, natural gas prices must
consistently stay below the current assumed level of $2.75 per million Btu before ExGen's adjusted FFO to debt falls
below 20%. While these stress ratio levels are low, they exhibit the low variable cost and highly depreciated nature of
its nuclear plants.
We expect 2019 financial ratios to be stronger than in the past, because ExGen will see the full benefit of ZEC
revenues, a cash flow benefit from the closure of the Three Mile Island reactor, and the use of renewable joint venture
(JV) proceeds for debt reduction.
We view ExGen's primary credit driver in coming years as its ability to maintain cash flows in 2020 and beyond. Given
advancing renewable proliferation and distributed generation/energy efficiency gains, we are concerned that power
prices in the outer forward curve could cause a significant decline in ExGen's earnings. As a result, we expect the
company's long-term plan to incorporate significant deleveraging through the next three years. The company has
indicated to us that it is targeting an adjusted debt to EBITDA of less than 3.0x and adjusted FFO to debt of more than
35%. By our estimates, achieving these targets would mean reducing debt by about $2.5 billion through 2022. We think
cash flow over the next three years would allow this level of debt reduction. We expect FFO to debt levels to improve
in 2019 and 2020 as the company reduces capital spending and moves decisively to deleverage. We expect the
company to have minimal growth-oriented capital spending.
Despite lower gas prices, we expect FOCF to debt to remain positive in the next few years, and that ExGen will cut
$2.5 billion of ExGen or corporate debt by 2022.

Liquidity : Adequate
Because we view ExGen as a core subsidiary, its liquidity profile is governed by that of its parent, and our short-term
rating on Exelon is 'A-2'. We assess its liquidity as adequate.
We expect Exelon to cover its liquidity needs for the next 12 months even if EBITDA declines by 10%, and that
liquidity sources will exceed uses by more than 1.1x. Under our stress scenario, we don't anticipate that Exelon would
require access to the capital markets to meet its liquidity needs under our distress scenario. The company benefits
from stable cash flow, the ability to absorb high-impact but low-probability events with limited need for refinancing,
sound bank relationships, solid standing in credit markets, and generally prudent risk management.
As of June 30, 2019, parent Exelon Corp. had a consolidated credit facility of $9.65 billion (comprising Baltimore Gas
& Electric Co.'s $600 million, Commonwealth Edison Co.'s $1 billion, PECO Energy Co.'s $600 million, ExGen's $5.945
billion, PEPCO Holdings Inc.'s $300 million, Delmarva Power & Light Co.'s $300 million, Atlantic City Electric Co.'s
$300 million, and Exelon Corp.'s $600 million). At end of the second quarter of 2019, Exelon had about $560 million of
commercial paper outstanding.
While ExGen's liquidity assessment is linked to Exelon's, on a stand-alone basis ExGen's liquidity is strong and we

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

AUGUST 16, 2019 10

Exelon Generation Co. LLC

assess the short-term rating at 'A-2'.
Over the next 12 months, we expect liquidity sources at ExGen to exceed by about 2.5x, and that sources would
exceed uses even if EBITDA declines by 30%. While there is a $600 million debt maturity in 2019, ExGen has sufficient
cash on hand and revolver availability under its $5.3 billion revolver (excluding a $645 million bilateral facility) to meet
debt repayment obligations.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• FFO of approximately $4 billion;

• Long-term debt repayment of about $625 million;

• Revolver and bilaterals availability of approximately
$4.8 billion; and

• Capital expenditures of about $1.9 billion;

• Estimated cash balances of about $700 million.

• Working capital charges of about approximately
$100 million; and
• Dividend to parent of $800 million.

Environmental, Social, and Governance
We view environmental factors as the most important of the environment, social, and governance (ESG) drivers to
ExGen's credit quality. ExGen has a total owned capacity of more than 32 GW across the United States. Of the total
generation, around 30% of the generating sources are thermal. At the same time, ExGen has nuclear capacity that
accounts for almost 50% of its generation. ExGen receives ZECs in Illinois and New York---an acknowledgement by
these states of the zero emissions attributes of the nuclear units. We view these ZECs as material to ExGen's credit
quality.
We believe ExGen will continue to manage its nuclear fuel cycle such that more than 90% of the low-level waste
generated is Class A, which is the least radioactive. Our analysis monitors ExGen's operating performance of nuclear
units as this will continue to be a key driver of ExGen's ESG strategy.
As a generator and not a load serving entity, we do not see social exposure from communities or workforce as material
for ExGen. However, these could gain eminence if there are further nuclear unit closures over and above the ones
announced-Three Mile Island and Oyster Creek. As recruiters of large workforces, closure of nuclear units affects local
communities in significant ways.
Governance factors are consistent with what we see across the industry. Through its parent, Exelon, the company
maintains a team to address environmental compliance and strategy. The governance structure also includes a
generation oversight committee and a Corporate Governance committee which supervises compliance with health and
safety laws.
