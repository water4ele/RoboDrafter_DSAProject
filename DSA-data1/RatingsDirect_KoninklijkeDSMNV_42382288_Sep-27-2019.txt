Overview
Key Strengths

Key Risks

Leading market positions in a wide range of nutritional products including vitamins,
carotenoids, lipids, and feed enzymes.

Intense competition from Chinese producers of vitamins
(notably vitamin E and C).

Broad product, end-market, and geographical diversity.

Significant cash outlays for funding shareholder returns and
potential acquisitions.

Strong funds from operations (FFO) to debt of about 80% in 2019, reducing from a
high level in 2018, but remaining strong.
Exceptional liquidity and considerable headroom under the current rating.
Strong innovation pipeline addressing growth and sustainability targets.

DSM's earnings are supported by its leading market position in the profitable nutrition business and solid end-market
diversification: We believe its earnings in the nutrition business will continue to benefit from fundamental megatrends
such as the growing population, the increasing demand for convenience and processed foods, growing consumption of
meat, and rising awareness of health and the role of dietary supplements. The company plans to support its organic
growth through acquisitions primarily in the nutrition sector.
Credit quality is supported by its large research & development projects and cost controls as outlined in its Strategy
2019-2021, announced last year. We believe the company's focus on developing innovative solutions in the fields of
nutrition and health, and climate and energy, and resources, along with continued cost discipline, will support its credit
quality.
Strong free operating cash flow (FOCF) generation has improved its cash position and DSM has considerable headroom
under the rating. We anticipate that DSM will undertake acquisitions and also continue to return cash to shareholders.
We do not believe that management is committed to a higher rating.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our view that Dutch chemicals company Koninklijke DSM N.V. (DSM) will report
resilient operating performance in the coming years, benefiting from a focus on cost efficiencies, working capital
management, and innovation. We consider a ratio of S&P Global Ratings-adjusted funds from operations (FFO) to
debt of about 35%-40% as commensurate with the 'A-' rating and believe that the company has considerable rating
headroom.

Downside scenario
We see a downgrade as unlikely, reflecting the strong rating headroom. However, we could lower the rating if
DSM's FFO to debt declined below 35%, for example if the nutrition segment margins weakened as a result of
increased competition, or if the benefits of its operational efficiency program were not sustainable. Similarly, a
weaker financial policy commitment, demonstrated, for example, by a combination of higher-than-anticipated
acquisitions, dividends, or share buybacks, could also prompt a negative rating action.

Upside scenario
We could raise the rating on DSM provided that we were confident that the company could sustain an adjusted
FFO-to-debt ratio of above 45%--a level that we view as commensurate with an 'A' rating. We would take this
action if we were confident that DSM would maintain an appropriate balance between potential acquisitions,
dividends, and share buybacks, such that the FFO-to-debt ratio was maintained, and if management committed to
higher credit metrics.

Koninklijke DSM N.V.

Assumptions

• We expect revenues to be flat year-on-year in 2019,
including the temporary vitamin effect for 2018, as
vitamin prices normalize after the exceptionally high
revenues of 2018. The company has reported
revenue decline of 5% year-on-year in first-half
2019, including the 2018 temporary vitamin effect.
We expect the performance to improve in the
second half as underlying revenue growth remains
strong.

• We assume sales growth of 3%-4% in 2020-2022,
driven by volume growth in animal nutrition and
human nutrition. In performance materials, we
expect 2% growth in sales in 2019, increasing over
the forecast period, to reach DSM's strategic target
of 5% by 2023. The growth is expected to be led by
a move toward sustainable solutions.
• Reported EBITDA margins (after exceptional items)
of 17%-18% supported by DSM's comprehensive
cost savings program in the nutrition segment and
support functions.
• Working capital outflows of about €0.1 billion-€0.2
billion over the forecast period, reflecting growth of
the business.
• Capital expenditure (capex) of about €0.6
billion-€0.7 billion, of which we understand about
50% is for maintenance.
• Cash dividends of about €0.3 billion reflecting
DSM's stable-to-progressive dividend policy.
• Share buyback of €600 million in 2019 and €400
million in 2020, based on the share buyback
program announced by the company, on top of its
regular share buybacks for its stock dividends and
compensation programs, which amounted to €265
million in first-half 2019.
• We anticipate acquisitions of €0.6 billion expected in
2019, and €0.3 billion in 2020.

Base-case projections
DSM should see a normalization in EBITDA margins in 2019: We forecasts margins to normalize in 2019 as underlying
vitamin markets stabilize. We also assume that DSM's S&P Global Ratings-adjusted EBITDA margins will remain
resilient at 17%-18%, supported by DSM's comprehensive cost savings program in the nutrition segment and support

functions.
The company will maintain low leverage despite continued focus on acquisitions and shareholder returns: We project
leverage will be 1.0x-1.4x over our forecast period.

Company Description
DSM generated sales of €9.3 billion in 2018 by manufacturing numerous nutritional ingredients including fat- and
water-soluble vitamins, carotenoids, marine and microbial polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), as well as high
performance resins, optical fiber coatings, thermoplastic solutions, and fibers. DSM is part of The Netherlands' flagship
stock index, AEX 25. DSM had a market capitalization of €22.7 billion on July 31, 2019.
DSM operates across two divisions:
• Nutrition (73% of 2018 reported EBITDA). The division targets animal and human applications, and produces
vitamins, carotenoids, marine and microbial PUFAs, dietary supplements, taste ingredients, and enzymes. In
addition, it sells complete nutritional solutions including advanced premixes for animal feed as well as human
nutrition end-markets (including Food & Beverages, Dietary Supplements, Early Life Nutrition). About 10% of the
division's sales stem from direct sales to consumers and farmers. DSM holds leading positions in several of these
markets. Competitors include other specialty chemical companies such as BASF SE, DuPont (E.I.) De Nemours &
Co., Kerry Group PLC, International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., and several Chinese producers.
• Materials (27% of 2018 reported EBITDA). The division is split into three segments: engineering plastics, Dyneema,
and resins and functional materials. Products include specialty plastics used in components for electronics,
automotive, flexible packaging, and consumer goods industries, and high-quality resin solutions of paints and
industrial and optical fiber coatings. A further product is special polyethylene--notably, Dyneema, the world's
strongest fiber on a weight basis.

Business Risk: Strong
We assess DSM's business risk as strong, reflecting our view of its profitable nutrition division, which accounted for
about 73% of its 2018 reported EBITDA. The assessment factors in the solid diversification of DSM's nutrition
business, with diverse end-markets and countries of operation, and a broad portfolio of products including fat- and
water-soluble vitamins, carotenoids, marine and microbial PUFAs, and aroma, savory, and nutraceutical ingredients
and minerals, in which the company holds leading global market positions.
The nutrition business is less cyclical than other chemical businesses and has been growing consistently at above-GDP
rates in the past few years. This business will continue to benefit, in our view, from fundamental megatrends such as
the increasing population, the rising need for convenience and processed food, increasing consumption of meat, and
rising health awareness.
Our assessment of DSM's business benefits from the company's track record of innovation, with about 4% of annual
sales spent on R&D and innovation, accounting for about 20% of sales in 2018. The company has a diverse pipeline of
innovative solutions, including a methane-reducing feed additive for cows for which the company filed for EU

Koninklijke DSM N.V.

authorization in July 2019; omega 3 fatty acids from natural marine algae for animal nutrition (in a 50/50 collaboration
with Evonik Industries); and sugar reduction solutions such as fermented stevia.
Key risk factors, in our view, include competition from the Chinese vitamin producers (notably for vitamins E and C),
even though competition has weakened somewhat due to environmental regulations in China. Notwithstanding the
ongoing shift to higher-value specialty materials, we also take into account the potentially material fluctuations in
EBITDA generated by DSM's polyamide-based engineering plastics and high-performance resins, which constitute the
materials segment.
DSM reported strong results for the last 12 months from June 2019, with revenues of €9.4 billion (up from €9.3 billion
at year-end 2018) on an improved EBITDA margin (after exceptional items) of 19.6%, up from 18.9% at year-end 2018.
Growth was led primarily by the nutrition segment, which had volume-led organic growth of 4% year-on-year in first
half of 2019 in the animal nutrition segment. At the same time, human nutrition saw lower organic growth of 2% in the
first half of 2019 due to softer food and beverage volumes from large customers, and weaker prices in i-Health and
premixes. The materials segment faced a higher organic growth decline of 7% year-on-year due to weak
macroeconomic conditions in some of its end-markets. The segment continued to strengthen its margins with good
cost controls, with margins improving to 18.4% in first-half 2019, up from 17.5% in first-half 2018.

Financial Risk: Modest
Our financial risk assessment for DSM reflects our view that its credit metrics will remain strong, with adjusted FFO to
debt of 80%-82% in 2019 and more than 65% in 2020.
The strong operating performance over the last 12 months ending June 2019, and the net proceeds from various small
divestments, continues to keep the company's balance sheet strong, leaving considerable rating headroom and
flexibility for internal and external growth initiatives. That said, we recognize management's commitment to the 'A-'
rating and, as such, our assessment of the financial policy constrains the rating at the current level. We believe that as
a result, DSM is likely to look for acquisitions or additional investments in innovation over the medium term, while
remaining focused on delivering its Strategy 2019-21 efficiency program. It also has a meaningful €1 billion
shareholder return program, which we believe will be enhanced in case DSM were unsuccessful identifying a suitable
acquisition target.

Liquidity: Exceptional
We view DSM's liquidity as exceptional because we expect sources to surpass needs by 2.14x in the next 24 months.
DSM's debt documentation does not include any financial covenants, which we view as positive. In addition, we note
DSM's strong standing in capital markets, as illustrated by the favorable terms of its various debt issuances.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Unrestricted cash of €2.4 billion as of March 31,
2019.

• €430 million of debt maturities in the next 12
months.

• This is €104 million lower than reported cash
because we view this amount as restricted under our
criteria.

• Around €0.6 billion-€0.7 billion of capex.

• Full availability under revolving credit facility (RCFs)
of €1.0 billion, with maturity of July 2024.
• About €1.4 billion-€1.5 billion in FFO.

• Working capital outflows of around €0.3 billion-€0.4
billion, including seasonal working capital outflow of
€0.2 billion.
• We factor in acquisitions of €0.3 billion for 2019,
which have already been contracted as of first-half
2019.
• €0.2 billion-€0.3 billion in share repurchases, already
completed by first-half 2019.
• Dividends of €0.3 billion for 2019.

Covenant Analysis
DSM's debt documentation does not include any financial maintenance covenants.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

We consider DSM's exposure to environmental and social risk factors as moderately high. We believe DSM is
taking initiatives to address its ESG exposures and has set ambitious targets compared to its peers. Indeed, DSM is
targeting reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 30% by 2030 and increasing its electricity sourcing to 75%
renewables from 41% in 2018. We view governance in line with best practices and comparable to that of its peers.
We believe DSM is aligning its governance practices with its ESG commitment by linking part of its executive
compensation to its ESG targets. Furthermore, the interest rate on its €1.0 billion committed credit facility is linked
to GHG emission reduction.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
DSM's capital structure consists of a €300 million bond due 2019 (redeemed early as per Aug. 13, 2019), a €500 million
bond due 2022, a €500 million bond due 2024, a €500 million bond due 2025, and a €750 million bond due 2026. All
bonds are senior unsecured and issued by Koninklijke DSM N.V. Liquidity is supported by the €1 billion senior
unsecured RCF, maturing in July 2024. In addition, DSM has a commercial paper program of €1.5 billion.

Analytical conclusions
With no material priority obligations ranking ahead of DSM's senior unsecured obligations, we rate its senior
unsecured debt 'A-', the same as the issuer credit rating.
