Rationale
S&P Global Ratings assigned its 'AA+' long-term rating to the Wyoming Community Development Authority's (WCDA)
2019 series 3 housing revenue bonds. In addition, WCDA plans to issue 2019 series 4 variable-rate bonds in
conjunction with and on parity with the 2019 series 3 bonds, secured by the open indenture and a liquidity facility from
Bank of America N.A., which we will rate separately from this transaction.
Finally, we affirmed our 'AA+' long-term rating and various short-term ratings on the outstanding bonds previously
issued under WCDA's 1994 parity indenture. The outlook on all ratings, where applicable, is stable.
The 'AA+' long-term rating is based on our view of WCDA's 1994 Indenture credit characteristics as evidenced by the
following strengths:
• Strong credit quality of the mortgage loan collateral as evidenced by low delinquencies and foreclosures of 2.7%;
• Strength of the indenture's consolidated cash flow runs, through a variety of stress scenarios, that show an
unadjusted opening parity of 129.4% and an adjusted parity of 120.2% after accounting for S&P Global Ratings'
projected losses, as of the July 1, 2018, basis date (updated with significant transactions through June 30, 2019);
• Very strong reserves that are sized in accordance with our 'AA+' rating-level minimums to provide protection for
potential loan losses; and
• Excellent and experienced management of WCDA and strong oversight of the indenture.
Partly offsetting the above strengths is, in our view, some exposure, approximately 4.3% of loans outstanding, to a
non-investment-grade mortgage insurer.
The bond proceeds will be used to refund the authority's outstanding 2016 series 3 housing revenue bonds and to
make funds available to WCDA to purchase or acquire individual loans, most of which are expected to be insured or
guaranteed by an agency or instrumentality of the federal government. The bonds are subject to redemption prior to
maturity, including redemptions from unexpended proceeds, prepayments, and excess revenues, as outlined in the
official statement.

Outlook
The stable outlook reflects our expectation of continued high parity and improved performance of the mortgage
portfolio. In addition, the outlook reflects our expectation that WCDA will continue to closely monitor the indenture to
ensure its solid performance.

Upside scenario
If WCDA were to provide cash flows demonstrating the indenture's ability to withstand our 'AAA' stress assumptions
for prepayments, variable interest rates, and loss coverage we could take positive rating action.

Downside scenario
While we find it unlikely, we believe that a significant deterioration in loan performance, the quality of investments,
material decline of indenture parity, or a lowering of the U.S. sovereign rating could result in negative rating action.

Assets
WCDA's 1994 indenture continues to perform well and is composed of high-quality assets. The indenture's improving
financial health has helped it achieve a strong equity position and has given the authority increased flexibility in
managing its reserve levels for the long term. Credit loan loss coverage is provided through the evaporation of assets
in cash flow scenarios and overcollateralization. Liquidity well in excess of our 2% of the loans benchmark is provided
by reserve fund assets and advance claims components of the pool policies.
According to management, as of June 30, 2019, there were approximately $734.3 million in loans outstanding
(including approximately $20.2 million outstanding principal balance of loans that were purchased with proceeds of
bonds but participations in which are pledged to the payment of bonds issued under the 2009 indenture) under the
program. Approximately 89.0% carry Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insurance or guarantees from the U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or rural development. The remaining loans are primarily insured by private
mortgage insurance (PMI) provided by Radian Guaranty or Genworth Mortgage, or are uninsured loans. While loans
insured by PMI have exposed the agency to higher projected loan losses, we believe that the excess assets available
under the indenture are sufficient to cover any potential loan losses. Additionally, the authority continues to reduce the
percentage of the portfolio insured by PMI providers. As of June 30, 2019, insurance coverage for the 1994 indenture
loans is as follows:
• FHA: 57.18%
• VA: 8.36%
• USDA – Rural Development: 23.47%
• Private: 7.92%
• Uninsured or other: 3.07%
S&P Global Ratings reviewed consolidated cash flow projections and stress scenarios with a July 1, 2018, basis date,

updated with significant transactions through June 30, 2019, and including preliminary transaction assumptions of the
2019 series 3 and 4 bond issuance. The cash flows were modeled on a 30-day payment lag, under various prepayment
scenarios, and show the sufficiency of assets and revenue to pay full and timely debt service, plus program fees.
Consolidated cash flows are very strong and show an asset-to-liability parity ratio of 129.4%, or $182.9 million in
excess assets as of July 1, 2018. After applying a 7.28% credit loss stress to the cash flows, parity remains very solid,
reaching an adjusted 117.83% on the lowest parity date of June 1, 2019, further indicating the stability and
performance of the indenture.
According to Mortgage Bankers Assn. statistics for the fourth quarter of 2018, the state of Wyoming had a delinquency
and foreclosure rate of 3.10% (with delinquencies measured by loans that were more than 60 days delinquent),
assuming a similar loan composition to WCDA's. During that time, WCDA had a delinquency and foreclosure rate of
3.11%, a decline from the peak of 7.74% in the fourth quarter of 2012, and a decrease from the 5.2% reported in the
second quarter of 2016. In the event that actual losses occur under the indenture, we would look to the
overcollateralization of the indenture to support these losses.
Investments consist of very high quality U.S. Treasuries, money market funds, U.S. agencies, mortgage-backed
securities, and cash equivalents. The bonds are additionally secured by three reserve funds: the bond reserve fund, the
mortgage reserve fund, and a special reserve fund to cover loan losses, as specified in the general and supplemental
indentures. According to the cash flow analysis, total parity assets excluding mortgage loans equal approximately
$192.3 million, or 31% of principal amount of bonds outstanding under the indenture.

Debt
Approximately 89% of WCDA's total debt consists of bonds issued under the authority's 1994 indenture. WCDA has a
relatively low-risk debt profile and employs strong debt management policies that intentionally manage its risk
exposure to variable rate debt. According to June 30, 2018, audited financial statements, there were approximately
$619.6 million of bonds outstanding under the indenture. Of that $119.4 million, or approximately 19%, were
variable-rate debt. About 69% of the variable-rate debt was hedged through interest-rate swaps with counter parties
that meet our minimum eligible rating requirements for WCDA's current rating. WCDA actively manages its exposure
to variable-rate debt and has done so strategically through balancing fixed and variable rate new issuances.
Variable-rate exposure was approximately 20% as of Dec. 31, 2016, and has remained around that level over the past
several periods, expected to be even lower at approximately 16.17% after the issuance of the 2019-3 and 4 bonds.
