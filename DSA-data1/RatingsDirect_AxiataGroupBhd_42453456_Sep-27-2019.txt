Key Risks

Solid position among the top three wireless telecommunications service

Elevated levels of investment to grow presence in emerging
markets.

Wide regional diversification with presence in mature and growing markets.

Gradual increase in exposure to developing countries with high
regulatory and political risk.

Moderate leverage and supportive financial policy, encouraged by portfolio
rationalization.

Shelving of proposed merger with Telenor ASA (A/Watch Neg/A-1) has no impact on Axiata Group Bhd.
(BBB+/Stable/--) rating. The rating on Axiata has been not predicated on the merger happening. Given the progress
of merger talks, we expect Axiata to continue exploring other consolidation opportunities.
Axiata's earnings and margins to recover moderately, with more rational competition in one of its main markets of
Indonesia and increased contribution from emerging markets. Axiata's Indonesian operations are expected to benefit
from lower competitive pressure. Contributions from subsidiaries in emerging markets will increase with the growth
momentum of data consumption. Growth prospects in emerging markets somewhat mitigate limited longer-term
growth in mature markets. Groupwide cost optimization is also expected to uplift adjusted EBITDA margin, which is
estimated to widen to 39%-40%.

Credit metrics will benefit from improved performance as well as portfolio rationalization. We estimate that Axiata's
debt-to-EBITDA ratio will improve to about 2.2x-2.3x in fiscal 2020 from 2.5x in fiscal 2018. Besides performance
improvement, portfolio rationalization with divestment of noncore assets is expected to allow some deleveraging and
uplift in credit metrics. This is after the implementation of new lease accounting standards under the Malaysian
Financial Reporting Standards (MFRS) 16, which had an adverse impact on the company's financial ratios.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on Malaysia-based Axiata reflects our expectation that the company will maintain stable
operating performance over the next 18-24 months. We project Axiata's debt-to-EBITDA ratio to not significantly
exceed 2.0x on a sustained basis, while maintaining strong cash flows and balancing its investment outlays with
dividends to shareholders.

Downside scenario
We may lower the rating if Axiata's financial strength significantly deteriorates, resulting in a debt-to-EBITDA ratio
of significantly more than 2.0x on a sustained basis. This scenario could arise if: (1) Axiata makes material
debt-funded investments or capital expenditure (capex) beyond our expectations; (2) its shareholder distributions
significantly exceed our estimates; or (3) the company's operating performance weakens substantially.

Upside scenario
An upgrade is unlikely over the next 24 months. Nevertheless, we may raise the rating if Axiata moderates its
acquisition growth strategy and commits to a conservative financial policy, such that the ratio of funds from
operations (FFO) to debt exceeds 60% on a consistent basis. This also assumes that the company will maintain its
competitive position.
We may also raise the rating if Axiata significantly improves its competitive position in Malaysia.

Assumptions

• Malaysia's GDP growth to be 4.4% in 2019 and 4.5%
in 2020. Indonesia's GDP growth to be 5.1% in 2019
and 5.2% in 2020.
• Moderate linkage of Axiata's overall revenue growth
to individual country GDP growth, given its diverse
regional footprint. We believe that local competitive
dynamics in each individual market play a more
integral role in the company's performance.
• Group revenue to rise 3%-4% in fiscal 2019. This
improvement is attributable to recovery in
Indonesia's PT XL Axiata Tbk. (XL Axiata) and also
supported by increased contribution from emerging
markets. This mitigates degrowth in Malaysia's
Celcom Axiata Bhd. (Celcom).

• Celcom to see moderate decline in revenue of
4%-5% in fiscal 2019, with a decline in its subscriber
base but a higher blended average revenue per user
(ARPU). Thereafter, we expect slight decline of
2%-3% in fiscal 2020.
• XL Axiata's revenue to see higher growth of 5%-7%
over the projection period, underpinned by more
rational competition and expansion into ex-Java
areas.
• Reported EBITDA to improve to about 38% over the
next two years due to groupwide cost optimization
and higher contribution from emerging markets.
• Elevated capital spending at about Malaysian ringgit
(MYR) 6.6 billion-MYR6.8 billion in fiscal 2019 and
MYR6.2 billion-MYR6.4 billion in fiscal 2020. This is
to fund network improvement and rollout of new
technologies in emerging markets. Capex is also
expected to be higher in the digital and
infrastructure arenas as the group grows these
business verticals.
• Dividend payouts that we estimate to be of
approximately MYR900 million to MYR1 billion in
fiscals 2019 and 2020. But we expect Axiata to lower
payouts if there are more pressing cash needs.
• Exclusion of potential payment of capital gains tax
for Ncell--Axiata's mobile network operator in
Nepal--due to material uncertainties still shrouding
the potential payment.

Base-case projections
We expect Axiata's cash flows to recover in fiscal 2019 and improve further in fiscal 2020. Moderating competition in
one of its main markets of Indonesia is the main driver for growth over the projection period. We also expect
investments made in emerging markets to reap rewards.
Further portfolio rationalization with sale of noncore assets and deepening of investments in others, predominantly
funded by debt. We expect Axiata to continue its practice of portfolio review to monetize noncore assets. The
proceeds will be used to deepen investments in strategic assets. Capital spending is forecast to remain elevated to
strengthen network and technology in emerging markets, increase the footprint of edotco (Axiata's regional
telecommunications towers company), and grow digital assets.

Company Description
Axiata is a Malaysia-based telecommunications provider with operations in South and Southeast Asia (see table 1). In
2018, it generated about MYR23.9 billion in revenue and MYR8.7 billion in adjusted EBITDA. The company was
incorporated in 1992 as TM International Bhd. before changing its name to Axiata Group Bhd. in March 2009. Axiata
is headquartered in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
Khazanah Nasional Bhd.--the Malaysian government's strategic investment fund--is the largest shareholder, with a 36%
direct stake. As of Dec. 31, 2018, Axiata is approximately 72% owned by government-related entities such as
Permodalan Nasional Bhd. and the Employees Provident Fund.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
Meaningful geographic diversification with a good mix of mature and high-growth markets providing core stability.
Axiata has meaningful market shares in its various operating markets and is among the top three players in each
market. Its operations are geographically diversified, with further diversification between mature and high-growth
markets. This is expected to support overall stability.

For the quarter ended March 31, 2019, Celcom is the second-largest player. Among the three largest players, Celcom
had 31% revenue market share--behind Maxis' 39% and just slightly ahead of Digi's 30%. We expect Celcom's revenue
market share to remain within close range of Digi's over the next 24 months, while remaining behind Maxis'.

We believe that Celcom's subscriber base will decline, with the decline in prepaid subscribers outpacing the increase in
postpaid subscribers. This is against the backdrop of Malaysia's high mobile market penetration that limits organic
growth. As of end-2018, Malaysia's mobile penetration rate was 130.2%. Nonetheless, we expect Celcom's continued
focus on high-value customers to reap benefits in terms of higher ARPU. This partially offsets the decline in subscriber
base, resulting in the expected 4%-5% decline in Celcom's revenue in fiscal 2019. However, Celcom's EBITDA is
forecast to improve due to the absence of taxing promotional activities. Celcom dangled 100,000 free handsets in a
2018 promotion to grow its subscriber base.
Competition in Indonesia intensified in the earlier half of 2018, following a prepaid SIM registration exercise. Despite
this, XL Axiata maintained its subscriber base while other operators such as PT Telekomunikasi Selular and PT Indosat
Tbk. saw declines. XL Axiata overtook Indosat to become the second-largest player by revenue market share in 2018.
We expect an increasing subscriber base and data migration to drive growth over the projection period. XL Axiata is
anticipating subscriber base growth outside Java with the expansion of its 4G network. We expect XL Axiata to remain
in second position over the next 18-24 months and for its lead over Indosat to widen.
We believe contributions from emerging markets will grow and that Axiata will maintain leading positions. This is
underpinned by expectations that Axiata will deepen investments in their networks and that these markets will see a
strong growth momentum in data consumption.
We also expect edotco's contribution to increase in 2019 due to more towers and managed sites. Given Axiata's plan
to grow its tower infrastructure segment, we expect edotco's revenue to increase over the longer term with both
acquisitive and organic growth.
In our view, Axiata's presence in mature and emerging markets is strategic. The portfolio provides Axiata with both
stability and growth potential. We estimate Axiata's growth to be an annualized 3%-4% in fiscals 2019 and 2020. With
limited organic growth opportunities in its main markets, Axiata is looking to undertake groupwide cost optimization.
Overall, we estimate adjusted EBITDA to recover to the range of 39%-40% from 36.4% in 2018.
However, we believe Axiata's increasing exposure to higher-risk noninvestment-grade countries may temper the
benefits of diversification to some extent. In our view, these countries have higher risk of currency depreciation,
political uncertainty, regulatory risk, weaker macroeconomic conditions, and competitive pressure. Apart from Ncell's
capital tax issue in Nepal, we currently do not foresee any material regulatory risk for Axiata.

Adjusted ratios

We view Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. (Singtel; A+/Negative/A-1) as a peer because it is a regionally
diversified telco as well. Although Telekom Malaysia Bhd. (A-/Stable/--) has predominantly fixed-line operations as
compared to Axiata's predominantly mobile operations, it is viewed as a peer due to its operations in Malaysia and its
similar shareholding by the Malaysian government. We also view Thailand-based Advanced Info Service Public Co.
Ltd. (AIS; BBB+/Stable/--) as a peer due to its predominantly mobile operations.
Compared with Singtel, Axiata has a smaller scale of operations and narrower focus on wireless services. Singtel's
revenue of US$13 billion is more than twice of Axiata's US$5.8 billion. Singtel is comparatively more diversified in
fixed-line and digital services. Its mobile subsidiaries and associates also have better market positions that those of
Axiata's. These factors lead to Singtel's comparatively stronger portfolio.
Telekom Malaysia's business benefits from its entrenched almost-monopolistic position in Malaysia's fixed-line
telecommunications services. It is also the Malaysian government's partner to further the latter's plans for the
telecommunications industry. In this aspect, Axiata is comparatively weaker. While Axiata's entities are among the
leading players in their respective markets, it does not enjoy similar monopolistic benefits. Instead, it faces strong
competition in its oligopolistic main markets of Malaysia and Indonesia.

SEPTEMBER 13, 2019 10

Although AIS operates only in Thailand, its business strength is similar to Axiata's--because both have similar revenue
sizes. While AIS operates in a competitive environment with two other incumbents, it has demonstrated a resilient and
meaningful lead in its revenue market share.
Within the peer group, Axiata is the most leveraged while Singtel is the least leveraged despite both companies being
regionally diversified. Axiata's high leverage is due to its acquisitive growth strategy. Axiata's higher debt is also a
function of its portfolio strategy, where it holds majority stakes in most of its mobile operations--with the exception of
Vodafone Idea Ltd., an Indian telecommunications operator. Resultantly, Axiata consolidates the debt of its regional
subsidiaries. In contrast, Singtel only has majority stakes in its telco operations in Singapore and Australia. With
minority stakes in its regional associates, they are equity-accounted for and Singtel does not add their debt to its
consolidated balance sheet. AIS' debt-to-EBITDA ratio is just marginally lower than Axiata's, despite AIS' geographical
concentration. AIS' high leverage is due to high spectrum costs in Thailand.

Financial Risk: Modest
Steady cash flows are expected to continue. Proceeds from portfolio optimization will help to fund capex in strategic
operations. Axiata's cash flows declined in fiscal 2018, mainly due to increased competition in its main markets and
also due to unfavorable currency movements. Over the projection period, we expect recovery in its cash flows, backed
by recovery in one of its main markets of Indonesia. Cost optimization efforts will also help to uplift cash flows.
We opine that Axiata is committed to keeping modest leverage. Axiata maintains its well-articulated policy to keep the
ratio of reported gross debt to EBITDA below 2.5x. While its debt-to-EBITDA ratio deteriorated in fiscal 2018 with
weakened business performance, proceeds from the sale of Singapore mobile operator M1 Ltd. in early 2019 provided
cushion to its credit metrics. Axiata also decreased its dividend payouts in 2016 and 2017 to conserve cash. This
cushioned the cash outflows resulting from the acquisition of Ncell and amid significant foreign exchange volatility.
Despite these efforts, we estimate that Axiata's ratio of debt to EBITDA will remain high in fiscal 2019 at 2.3x-2.4x.
This is mainly due to the implementation of MFRS 16, which resulted in the recognition of a larger-than-expected
amount of lease obligations. However, we expect Axiata's more conservative policies and recovery in performance to
translate into improvement in its ratio of debt to EBITDA in the following years. We expect the ratio to improve to
2.2x-2.3x in fiscal 2020 and further to 2.1x-2.2x in fiscal 2021.
Axiata's capex is expected to remain elevated as the company continues to deploy 3G/4G technologies and improve
networks in emerging markets. Furthermore, we also expect capital spending to remain high in growing its digital and
tower infrastructure segments.
Other than the sale of M1, Axiata also reduced its effective shareholding in Vodafone Idea. We see reductions in these
nonstrategic investments as credit-positive as we do not expect meaningful value accretion from these holdings. Funds
can be channeled into deleveraging to better position Axiata to seize strategic investment opportunities.

Liquidity: Adequate
We consider Axiata to have adequate liquidity because we expect the company's sources of liquidity to exceed its uses
by about 1.24x over the 12 months to June 30, 2019. Given Axiata's sizable cash balances and manageable refinancing
over that period, we estimate that Axiata would be able to service its maturing debt, capital spending, and dividends
using its sources of liquidity even if EBITDA falls by 15%.
In our view, Axiata benefits from strong relationships with regional banks and has a good standing in credit markets,
given its size and operating record. We believe the company has generally prudent financial policies and risk
management to manage the impact of potentially negative events.

Covenant Analysis
Axiata does not have financial covenants at the holding company level. However, many of its operating subsidiaries
have financial covenants. We expect them to remain in compliance. While not all covenants are publicly disclosed,
certain ratios (debt to assets, EBITDA interest coverage, and debt to EBITDA) are required to be met.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

Axiata is exposed to regulatory risks, particularly in its emerging market operations. For example, Axiata operates
in Nepal through Ncell. It was given full clearance by the Large Taxpayers Office of Nepal (LTO) after it paid
capital gains tax in 2017, following its purchase of Ncell. However, the LTO brought further claims in April 2019,
which Axiata is contesting. Currently, we do not foresee any other material regulatory risk. But if Axiata increases
its presence in emerging markets, we consider increased regulatory risks to be inevitable.
Axiata has undertaken initiatives to increase energy efficiency and reduce carbon emission by constructing
bamboo telecommunication towers in Bangladesh and installing green energy sites. edotco is deploying more
bamboo towers in Bangladesh and is also looking to bring bamboo towers to its other markets. Axiata's installation
of green energy sites involves converting existing sites to use alternative sources of energy for power, instead of
diesel.

Group Influence
Our view that there is a moderate likelihood of extraordinary government support from the Malaysian government
through its sovereign national fund (Khazanah) is based on:
• Strong link with the government. Axiata is approximately 72% owned by government-related entities. Khazanah is
the single largest shareholder. In our view, the government of Malaysia can influence Axiata's strategic and
operating decisions through its holdings.
• Limited importance in terms of role to the government, given Axiata's significant diversification beyond Malaysia
and its role in the highly competitive domestic wireless telecommunications industry.
We believe Axiata has a moderate likelihood of extraordinary government support in situations of financial stress.
However, the rating on the company does not receive any notch-up benefit from its relationship with the Malaysian
government at the current rating level.

Rating Above The Sovereign
We believe our rating on Axiata is not constrained by the sovereign credit rating on Indonesia (BBB/Stable/A-2),
where it has significant assets and operations. Axiata generates about 30% of its revenue and EBITDA from Indonesia.
We believe Axiata will maintain adequate liquidity to meet its foreign currency obligation even in a hypothetical
sovereign stress scenario for Indonesia, assuming no cash flows from the Indonesian operations.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
Axiata's capital structure as of Dec. 31, 2018, consists of approximately MYR920 million in secured debt and
approximately MYR18.2 billion in unsecured debt.
About 7.7% of the total debt is held directly by Axiata while 6.6% pertains to fixed-rate guaranteed notes held by
Axiata's wholly owned subsidiary Axiata SPV1 (Labuan) Ltd. About 21.9% of total debt pertains to the rated
multicurrency Sukuk program held by Axiata's wholly owned subsidiary Axiata SPV2 Bhd. The program has no
financial maintenance covenants.

Analytical conclusions
Despite the predominance of structurally senior claims at the operating company level, we rate Axiata's senior
unsecured debt 'BBB+'--the same as our long-term issuer credit rating on the company. This reflects our view that
Axiata's leverage is low, which limits the possibility of senior unsecured debt holders being significantly disadvantaged
relative to other lenders. All else equal, if Axiata's financial position were to weaken--with the ratio of priority debt
(secured debt and debt at the operating subsidiaries level) to total debt remaining over 50%-- we would typically rate
unsecured debt one notch below the long-term issuer credit rating.
