One of the largest global copper producers, with about 1.1 million
tons of production in the 12 months ended June 2019.

Limited product diversity because 80% of its metal production comes
from copper, of which 41% comes from its Buenavista mine.

Low cash-cost producer, with fully integrated operations and a long
life reserve.

Exposure to copper price volatility.

Transportation business diversifies cash flow stream and somewhat
mitigates exposure to the cyclical commodity sector.

Environmental and social factors could continue to delay several of its
mining development projects.

Solid operating cash flow (OCF) generation that allows it to fund
large investments and shareholder rewards.

Transportation segment is sensitive to economic and geopolitical
conditions between Mexico and the U.S.

GMX will remain concentrated in copper although ongoing brownfield and greenfield projects will gradually reduce its
exposure to its Buenavista mine. We expect Grupo Mexico's (GMX) mining division to remain mainly exposed to
copper over the next few years--about 80% of its total metals volume sold, while about 41% of its production came
from its Buenavista mine last year. We believe that GMX robust pipeline of brownfield and greenfield projects,
including Toquepala (258,000 tons of copper production expected for this year), will reduce its exposure to its
Buenavista mine to about 38% of its total copper output production by the end of this year. Exposure will further
reduce to about 35% once its Tia Maria project starts producing in 2022 under our base-case scenario, although further
delays could occur during the construction phase. Tia Maria is a $1.4 billion copper project that should generate an
annual production of 120,000 tons of copper.
U.S.- China trade war and the risk of a potential deceleration of the global economy could further increase copper price
volatility. We recently lowered our copper price assumptions for 2019, 2020 and 2021 because we expect trade
tensions and new tariffs to weaken global trade, mildly softening copper demand. We still believe the global industry
will experience shortfalls of supply compared with demand and therefore we continue to see an upside for copper
prices, but our base case now indicates those deficits would be smaller than before. Despite volatile copper prices, we
expect GMX to keep its EBITDA margin above 45% thanks to its low cash-cost structure, given that most of its mines
are in the first two quartiles of the global cash cost curve ($1.02/lb of copper in the second quarter of 2019). Moreover,
GMX is also focusing on improving operating efficiency across its three divisions.

Solid OCF generation that sufficiently covers large investment plan, coupled with prudent and flexible shareholder
remuneration. GMX has a solid track record of positive OCF generation that we foresee to be about $3.0 billion
annually for 2019 and 2020. Such cash generation is possible thanks to GMX's low cash-cost structure and its business
diversification in the transportation segment that represents 20% to 25% of its total revenues. GMX's strong cash
generation covers its intensive investment program and flexible shareholder remuneration without requiring additional
external funding, while maintaining its net debt to EBITDA below 2.0x.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our view that GMX will maintain its current business diversification, with an EBITDA
margin above 45% and sufficient cash flow generation to cover its large investment pipeline.
Moreover, we expect the group to maintain its prudent approach towards dividend payment and the use of debt,
keeping its net debt to EBITDA below 2.0x in the next 12 to 24 months.

Downside scenario
We could lower our ratings on GMX and its rated mining subsidiaries in the next 24 months if its net debt to
EBITDA surpasses 2.0x on a consistent basis. This scenario could result from a sharp decline in copper prices, any
mine closures that undermine the group's operating performance and EBITDA, or if its transportation division
posts weaker-than-expected operating performance. Finally, a downgrade could also occur if the group adopts a
more aggressive financial strategy, including additional debt and a higher-than-expected capex or dividend
distribution that erodes its cash balance.

Upside scenario
A positive rating action is very unlikely in the next 24 months, because it would require GMX to significantly
increase its scale of operation and to further diversify its business by divisions, products, and mines, while
maintaining its net debt to EBITDA below 1.5x consistently.

Our Base-Case Scenario

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 3, 2019 4

Grupo Mexico S.A.B. de C.V.

Assumptions

• Mexico and U.S. GDP growth of 1.3% and 3.4% in
2019, respectively, and 1.8% and 3.7% in 2020. In
our opinion, economic growth in North America is
important for the transport division because it
continues to incentivize commercial activity.
• We recently lowered our copper prices for 2019,
2020, and 2021 because we expect trade tensions
and new tariffs to weaken global trade, mildly
softening copper demand. We now expect $2.85/lb.
for the rest of this year, versus $2.94/lb. last year.
However, we expect demand will modestly exceed
supply over the next few years, and help support
average prices of $2.95/lb. in 2020, although this is
lower than our previous expectation.

• We still believe the global copper industry will
experience shortfalls of supply compared to
demand, but our base case now indicates those
deficits would be smaller than predicted. We now
expect undersupply of less than 100,000 tons a year
in 2020 and 2021.
• GMX's copper output of slightly more than 1.1
million metric tons in 2019 and 2020, slightly above
last year's output. We expect GMX's copper output
to increase by about 12% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020,
due to a 88,100 ton capacity increase in Toquepala,
and solid performance at the Buenavista and U.S.
mines.
• Subsidiary GMexico Transportes, S.A. de C.V.'s
(GMXT) revenues to rise by about 6.5% in 2019 and
4.0% in 2020, mainly explained by continued
volume expansion and favorable trends in the
automotive, agricultural, and industrial segments, as
well as growth in the Mexican energy markets that
would support expansion of the company's
hydrocarbons transportation segment.
• The infrastructure division's contribution to the
group's total revenue will remain between 2% and
4% this year and next, although we expect the group
to pursue significant opportunities in the Mexican
energy industry while selling its full output of
electricity to third parties, providing higher
profitability.
• Capital expenditures (capex) of about $1.8 billion

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 3, 2019 5

Grupo Mexico S.A.B. de C.V.

this year and $2.5 billion next year. For 2019, this
will consist of about $1.2 billion for the mining
division (80% of which will be for maintenance
capex, the remaining of Toquepala project,
Buenavista mine, and Industrial Minera Mexico),
$400 million for the transportation (New rails and
ties, technology equipment, and locomotive
overhaul, among others), and about $300 million for
the infrastructure business line. For 2020, we foresee
about $1.8 billion for the mining division (70% of
which is for maintenance capex, Tia Maria, El Arco,
Buenavista and Pilares projects, and for the
Fundicion Ilo), $350 million for the transportation
division, and $320 million for the infrastructure
division.
• Dividend payments between $600 million and $1.5
billion during the projected period. We expect GMX
to maintain its flexible dividend payment policy
depending on its OCF generation and capex
deployment.

Base-case projections
Low to mid-single digit revenue growth and EBITDA margin to remain above 45%. Although we expect lower metal
prices--mainly copper, zinc, and silver for 2019 versus 2018--we expect GMX's metals production this year (growth of
4.5% in copper, 13.0% in molybdenum, 14.0% in silver, and 6.5% in gold, respectively against 2018 production) to
more than offset the lower prices. We also expect the transportation division to maintain its sales growth trajectory in
the mid-single digit area. As a result, we forecast GMX's revenues to grow at a low-to-mid single digit rate. At the same
time, we expect GMX to maintain its EBITDA margin above 45% thanks to its low cash-cost structure, high margin
transportation business, and its focus on adding operating efficiencies across its three business divisions.
GMX's net leverage to remain low in upcoming years despite volatile copper prices and capital-intensive projects, while
it maintains its flexible shareholders remuneration.We believe GMX will be able to sustain its net debt to EBITDA
below 2.0x over the next two years despite the current volatile metal prices environment, while it maintains its solid
cash position above $1.0 billion and its prudent financial policy towards using debt. We expect GMX to continue to
generate solid OCF of about $3.0 billion over the next two years that will support its flexible capital allocation towards
its capex needs and its dividend distribution.

Company Description
Funded in 1942 and headquartered in Mexico City, GMX has three business divisions:
• Mining: Through its subsidiary Americas Mining Corporation (AMC), GMX is one of the world's largest integrated
copper producers. It also explores, exploits, and obtains minerals and other byproducts such as silver, molybdenum,
zinc, sulfuric acid, gold, and selenium through its 15 underground and open pit mines, and its 13 exploration
projects in Mexico, Peru, the U.S., Chile, Ecuador, and Spain.

SEPTEMBER 3, 2019 6

Grupo Mexico S.A.B. de C.V.

• Transportation: Through its subsidiary GMXT, it offers railroad transportation services, including general hauling
and intermodal services, passenger transportation services, and auxiliary terminal management and intra-terminal
hauling services. This division provides railroad services for the farming, automotive, cement, energy, intermodal,
metals and minerals, industrial products, and chemical and fertilizer sectors.
• Infrastructure: Through its subsidiary México Proyectos y Desarrollos, S.A de C.V., it offers land and marine drilling
services, such as leasing and operating oil rigs and engineering services. It also generates energy through a
combined cycle plant and wind farm; and operates Salamanca-León highway.
Empresarios Industriales de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. owns 40.49% of GMX and German Larrea Mota Velasco owns
18.87%. The remaining 40.64% is free float.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
Our ratings on GMX incorporate:
• Its large operational scale, with $10.4 billion in revenue for the 12 months ended June 2019;
• Leading position as one of the world's largest copper producers (close to 1.0 million metric tons in 2018);
• The quality and longevity of its mine reserves, with over 50 years left at current production rates;
• Brownfield projects that will increase output in the next few years; and
• Low cash-cost structure ($1.02/lb. of copper in the second quarter of 2019).
These factors enhance the group's operating efficiency and somewhat reduce the impact of potential metal price
swings. Our ratings also incorporate GMX's operations and current investments that are based in investment-grade
countries, such as Mexico, the U.S., Peru, and Spain, providing greater long-term sustainability to its business and
margins.
However, the group's narrow product diversification limits the ratings, because about 80% of its mining division
depends on copper production. Moreover, about 40% of its copper production comes from its Buenavista Mine,
exposure that we expect to decline in the next couple of years once its new projects start production.
We consider GMX's mining division to be the group's core business and main ratings driver, because it will continue to
represent about 75% of consolidated revenue in the next couple of years. We believe that the group's railway
transportation service will continue to represent between 20% and 25% of the total revenue base, while the

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

Grupo Mexico S.A.B. de C.V.

infrastructure segment will remain a small revenue contributor.
GMXT (mxAAA/Stable/--) is a leading railroad operator in Mexico that benefits from exclusive concession rights from
the Mexican government through a 50-year concession title and operation exclusivity over 30 years. This gives GMXT
a high degree of certainty for its long-term business viability. GMXT also benefits from its wide coverage network,
which includes access to six harbors and five border crossings in northern Mexico, enabling it to cover 80% of the
country's trade and industrial areas and to have a wide diversity of end markets. However, we believe that the
transportation business division is sensitive to economic and geopolitical conditions in the region, which tend to be
affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuation and tariffs on transported products.
Overall, we expect GMX's consolidated EBITDA margin to remain above 45% in the next few years, given that about
87% of the group's total copper production is positioned in the first two quartiles in the global cash-cost curve.

Peer comparison
Among selected peers that produce copper, GMX has the smallest scale in terms of revenues. However, the company's
EBITDA margin compares favorably within its peer group, thanks to its low cash-cost structure and its focus on
increasing operating efficiencies.
In terms of credit metrics, GMX's adjusted debt to EBITDA of 1.6x at year-end 2018 compares well with its peers,
reflecting its solid OCF generation that allows to fund its capex and dividend distribution, and its prudent financial
policy towards debt.

Financial Risk: Modest
Despite volatile metal prices due to the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China, we expect GMX to continue
delivering a solid operating and financial performance. Under our base-case scenario, we expect GMX to post an
EBITDA margin above 45%, positive OCF generation that will cover its capex needs. We also believe it will keep its
flexible shareholder remuneration and adequate liquidity position, with a cash balance above $1.0 billion, and limited
financing needs. This should result in net debt to EBITDA consistently below 2.0x.
Although the group has a large investment plan for the next couple of years, with flagship projects such as Tia Maria,
Buenavista Zinc, El Arco, Pilares, El Pilar, and Fundicion Empalme and Ilo, among others, we expect GMX to generate
sufficient operating cash flows to fund its intensive capex plan. Moreover, we expect GMX to maintain its prudent
financial policy in all aspects. We also assume the company will continue to benefit from favorable access to markets
to refinance its maturities if needed.

Liquidity: Adequate
We continue to assess GMX's liquidity as adequate because we believe that its sources will exceed its uses by 1.2x in
the next 12 months, and that its net sources will remain positive even if EBITDA were to decline by as much as 15%.
We also believe GMX has the flexibility to delay part of its capex and dividend payments in order to preserve its
liquidity position if necessary. Our assessment also considers that GMX has generally prudent risk management,
limited refinancing risk in the short term thanks to its extended debt maturity profile, solid relationships with banks,
and satisfactory standing in domestic and international credit markets, as seen in its bonds that currently trade above
or close to their par values.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

In our view, environmental and social factors are very relevant to GMX's credit quality. In the past, GMX has faced
several environmental incidents and social tensions that resulted in miner fatalities, project delays, fines, and
cleanup costs, but these haven't significantly affected its operations and credit ratios. However, we believe that
environmental and social risks are becoming more important for GMX's credit quality. The recent partial and
temporary closure of GMX's Guaymas facility after the spill of about 3,000 liters of sulfuric acid into the Sea of
Cortez, in the state of Sonora, leads us to believe there's a possibility that the government might further investigate
GMX's operations with greater scrutiny to determine if the company's activities negatively affect the environment
and social factors. Therefore, there are external risks that the government could take unprecedented measures
including fines, and partially closing or suspending the company's concessions. Although these risks are not in our
base-case scenario, if they materialize, they could affect GMX's top- and bottom-line results, cash flows, credit
metrics, and ultimately its credit quality. Therefore, we believe that GMX's exposure to these risks, as well as
mitigation actions, could have more influence on the company's competitive position over the medium and long
term.
While we believe these risks are unlikely to have immediate material impact on the ratings on GMX because
they're part of the ongoing procedures for companies operating in the metal and mining sector, their relevance is
growing in line with regulators' and investors' increasing focus on ESG-related strategies.
GMX's board of directors and management are sensitive to environmental and social risks, and have invested
about $950 million in the past two years in order to mitigate health and security matters, and to create safer
conditions for its stakeholders and local communities where it operates.
We continue to assess GMX's management and governance as fair, mostly because of failures occurred in the past
while executing and maintaining its operations.

Rating Above The Sovereign
The ratings on GMX and its core mining subsidiaries are currently at the same level as our long-term foreign currency
rating on Mexico (BBB+/Negative/A-2). Nonetheless, the outlook divergence reflects our view that we could rate
GMX and its core mining subsidiaries up to two notches above our foreign currency rating on Mexico. In a
hypothetical stress scenario in Mexico, we believe that GMX will be able to continue generating strong cash flows
because of its export nature and dollarized structure (more than 80% of its revenues are dollar-denominated) which
make it less vulnerable to Mexico's economy. Moreover, in such a scenario we would expect GMX to continue posting
solid financial performance, supported by its resilient operations, manageable debt levels, and ample liquidity.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
As of June 30, 2019, the group reported approximately $8.4 billion of consolidated debt. Its capital structure consisted
of about $6.0 billion of debt issued at the mining division level--$5.9 billion of which are Southern Copper Corp.'s
(BBB+/Stable/--) various senior unsecured notes--and $51 million of Minera Mexico's (BBB+/Stable/--) guaranteed
Yankee bonds. The remaining 16% and 10% of the consolidated debt are issued or borrowed, respectively, at the
transportation and infrastructure level.

Analytical conclusions
We rate Southern Copper's various senior unsecured notes and Minera Mexico Yankee bonds at 'BBB+', in line with
the issuer credit rating on the group to reflect our view that there's no significant subordination risk present in its
capital structure, particularly considering that the group's leverage ratio is below 2.0x.
