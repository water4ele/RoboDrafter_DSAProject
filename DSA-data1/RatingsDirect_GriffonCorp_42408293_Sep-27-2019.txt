Key risks

Well-known brands with leading market positions in hand and
garden tools, closet storage and organization products, and garage
doors.

Leverage is high at over 5x EBITDA for the 12 months ended June 30, 2019.

Larger scale than many building materials companies and good
product diversity.

Most of the company's debt, including its senior notes, comes due over the
next three years.

Majority of revenues tied to relatively stable maintenance and
repair markets as opposed to new construction.

EBITDA margins are at the low end of the range we consider to be average,
though profitability is stable.
Moderate customer concentration in home centers, with Home Depot
making up 19% of sales, partially offset by diverse range of products and
stock keeping units.
Some earnings volatility in the defense electronics segment (15% of
revenues) due to size and timing of contracts.

Adjusted leverage is expected to remain high over the next 12 months. Adjusted leverage peaked at just over 7x
EBITDA in fiscal year 2017 following an agreement to sell Clopay Plastic Products to Berry Global Group, which
resulted in a substantial drop in revenue and EBITDA from continuing operations. Leverage then receded to 5.3x
EBITDA for the 12 months ended June 30, 2019, as contributions from ClosetMaid LLC and other acquisitions filled
the EBITDA gap. However, we expect leverage to remain at or slightly above 5x over the next year.
Most of Griffon Corp.'s debt comes due over the next three years. We could take a more critical view of the company's
capital structure and liquidity profile as debt maturities come closer to becoming current liabilities. The company has
several very large debt maturities coming due over the next three years, including its $350 million revolving credit
facility due in March 2021 ($123 million drawn and $21 million in letters of credit outstanding as of June 30, 2019).
Griffon also has $1 billion of senior notes due in March 2022. Earlier this year the company withdrew an opportunistic
offering of senior notes due to unfavorable market conditions that would have pushed out the maturity of a large
amount of the senior unsecured notes.
Well-known brands and leading market positions in the home and building products segment provide a competitive
advantage. Griffon's brands include Clopay garage doors, AMES garden tools, and ClosetMaid organization products.
Many products are the first or second-largest sellers in their categories, making them attractive for large retailers like

Home Depot and other customers. Furthermore, most sales are for repair and remodeling, which is more stable than
new construction markets.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our expectation that leverage will fall modestly, but remain at or slightly above 5x
EBITDA over the next 12 months. This scenario assumes demand for the company's products remains steady amid
modest overall economic growth and stable new housing starts. The stable outlook also assumes the maturity of
the company's revolving credit facility will be extended over the next several months.

Downside scenario
We would lower our rating in the near term if the revolving credit facility becomes a current liability, at which point
we would view liquidity to be less than adequate. Similarly, we would lower our rating in the intermediate term if a
substantial portion of the unsecured notes are not proactively refinanced because we would view a debt-laden
capital structure with a weighted average debt maturity of less than two years to be aggressive. We do not view a
downgrade tied to a sharp increase in leverage as likely in the next year given our expectations for stable demand
for most of Griffon's products.

Upside scenario
We could upgrade Griffon over the next 12 months if it extends its debt maturities and if adjusted debt to EBITDA
falls much further than our base-case forecast, to 4x or lower.

Base-case projections
The U.S. economy should support low-single-digit organic growth for Griffon. The U.S. accounted for 78% of Griffon's
sales in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 (ending Sept. 30). Our economists expect U.S. economic growth to slow
this year and next because of dissipating fiscal stimulus, mounting trade tension, and softer private fixed investment.
Still, they forecast low-single-digit growth over the next several years.
Our base-case financial forecast indicates that financial risk could improve in the intermediate term if near-term
maturities are addressed. We expect adjusted debt to EBITDA to drop below 5x over the next 12-24 months.
However, refinancing risk is the predominant credit constraint because most of the company's debt comes due in the
next three years.

Company Description
New York City-based Griffon operates two primary business segments. The larger home and building products
segment's brands include AMES (garden and landscaping tools), Clopay (residential garage doors), ClosetMaid (closet
organization), and Cornell Cookson (commercial garage doors). The smaller defense and electronics segment provides
intelligence, surveillance, and communications systems for defense, aerospace, and commercial customers. Griffon is
publicly traded (NYSE: GFF).

Business Risk: Fair
Business risks include EBITDA margins that are at the low end of the range (9%-18%) we view as average for building
products manufacturers, limited geographic diversity (78% of revenue is generated in the U.S.), modest customer
concentration (Home Depot accounts for 19% of sales), and limited competitive advantages in the defense electronics
segment (primarily because of its small scale). Strengths include overall good scale (nearly $2.2 billion of revenue
forecast for fiscal year 2019), competitive advantages in the home and building products segment (85% of sales), and a
low reliance on volatile residential and commercial construction end markets (less than 25% of sales).

Peer comparison
Peers with public financial statements include Armstrong World Industries (ceilings and walls), James Hardie
International Group Ltd. (fiber cement siding) and Mohawk Industries Inc. (flooring products). All four companies sell
branded products for residential and other end markets. Griffon, Armstrong, and James Hardie also have similar
business risk profiles. The primary rating differentiator is financial risk, as all three peers have materially lower
leverage than Griffon.

Financial Risk: Highly leveraged
Griffon's high leverage stems partly from the purchase of ClosetMaid in 2017 and Cornell Cookson in 2018. The $186
million ClosetMaid acquisition was funded with a $275 million add-on to its 5.25% senior notes due 2022, while the
$180 million Cornell Cookson acquisition was funded with cash and revolver borrowings. Leverage was also affected
by a 2017 agreement to sell the Clopay Plastics business, which was then classified as a discontinued operation,
sharply reducing EBITDA from continuing operations. Debt to EBITDA peaked at 7.1x in 2017, and the sale was
completed in February 2018. Since then, contributions from ClosetMaid and other acquisitions, plus organic growth,
have helped lower leverage to 5.4x EBITDA for the 12 months ended June 30. We forecast leverage to fall further
toward 5.0x over the next 12 months.
While key credit measures have improved and continue to strengthen under our base-case scenario, refinancing risk is
the predominant credit constraint at this time. The weighted average maturity of Griffon's debt is under four years.

Liquidity: Adequate
We view Griffon to have adequate liquidity over the next 12 months, with estimated sources covering estimated uses
by more than 2x.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• $140 million of forecast funds from operation.

• $48 million of working capital outflows.

• $207 million available on a revolving credit facility
due 2021.

• About $50 million of capital expenditures.
• $13 million of dividends.

• $70 million of cash and short term investments.

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 6, 2019 7

Griffon Corp.

Debt maturities
• $123 million drawn on a credit facility due 2021.
• $1 billion 5.25% senior notes due 2022.
• $48 million additional debt with various maturities.

Covenant Analysis
Requirements
• Total Leverage: maximum 6.5x
• Senior secured leverage: maximum 3x
• Interest coverage: minimum 2.5x

Compliance expectations
Net debt to EBITDA (as calculated according to debt agreements) was 5.4x on June 30, 2019. We expect Griffon to
remain in compliance with this total leverage covenant given our forecast for leverage to improve. Similarly, we expect
the company to remain in compliance with other financial covenants.

Issue Ratings - Recovery Analysis
Key analytical factors
Our 'BB' issue-level and '1' recovery rating on the company's $350 million revolving credit facility reflect our
expectation for very high (90%-100%; rounded estimate: 95%) recovery in the event of a payment default.
Our 'B+' issue-level and '4' recovery rating on the company's $1 billion senior notes reflect our expectation for average
(30%-50%; rounded estimate 30%) recovery in the event of a payment default.
Our simulated default scenario contemplates a prolonged economic contraction in the U.S., with decreased residential
repair and remodeling spending coupled with a smaller U.S. Department of Defense budget. These factors would
severely impair Griffon's operational performance. Eventually this would cause a debt restructuring, payment default
or bankruptcy filing.
In valuing the company, we attributed approximately 70% of the net enterprise value (about $483 million) to Griffon's
domestic subsidiaries and 30% (about $207 million) to its foreign subsidiaries. We further assume the revolving credit
facility is 85% drawn at default, consistent with our treatment of committed credit facilities.

Simulated default assumptions
• Simulated year of default: 2023
• EBITDA at emergence: $132 million
• EBITDA multiple: 5.5x (consistent with other building products companies)
• Gross enterprise value: $727 million

Simplified waterfall
• Net recovery value (after 5% administrative costs): $690 million
• Valuation split (obligors/nonobligors): 70%/30%
• Priority domestic claims (capital leases): about $5 million

• Revolving credit facility claim: about $300 million
• --Recovery expectation: 90%-100% (rounded estimate: 95%)
• Remaining value for unsecured claims: about $330 million
• Senior notes claim: $1.03 billion
• --Recovery expectation: 30%-50% (rounded estimate: 30%)
