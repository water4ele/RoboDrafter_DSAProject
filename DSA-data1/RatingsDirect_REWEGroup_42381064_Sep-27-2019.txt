Overview
Key Strengths

Key Risks

Strong market positions in German (no. 2), Austrian (no. 1), and
Czech (no. 1) supermarket businesses, with modest but increasing
diversification in less saturated Eastern Europe.

Tough price competition in Germany, especially from discount operators.

Innovative retailer, being one of the first to introduce food-to-go
formats and to focus on regional and organic products, as well as
to roll out nationwide online food retailing in Germany.

Higher volatility in the travel and do-it-yourself sectors than in food retailing,
albeit with equally fierce competition.

Strong merchandising strategy of expanding product lines with
continuous improvement in quality and freshness, supporting
brand positioning.

Planned store openings, modernization strategy, and investments in real
estate, which will require high capital expenditures resulting in negative free
operating cash flow for next two-to-three years on a reported basis.

Supportive financial policy commitment for an investment-grade
rating, including possible reduction of capital expenditures and
real estate investment in case of weaker operating performance.

A heavy debt burden, mostly due to capitalized operating lease debt (75%)
and gradually increasing due to the debt-financed capital expenditures and
Lekkerland acquisition resulting in constrained forecast credit metrics despite
earnings growth.

An entrenched market position in Germany, with strong store presence and formats, developed online offering, and
diversification in Eastern Europe all supporting growth prospects.REWE Group's distinct position in food retailing with
stores in mostly urban areas focused on supermarket, discount, and convenience formats; and increasing share of
organic, regional, and fresh merchandise positions the group well, especially considering the very competitive home
market in Germany exhibiting a high share of discount stores. In addition, the group's expansion in less saturated
Eastern Europe results in strong growth in international retail business segment with S&P Global Ratings expecting
about 6% annual revenue growth in this segment for the next two years.
High capital expenditure requirements support growth strategy, resulting in negative reported free operating cash flow
and constrained credit metrics. Rewe has a long-term investment strategy, with store expansion and modernization
and investment into real estate and logistical capabilities to support long-term business growth with management
estimated annual capital expenditures (capex) of over €2 billion for the next three years resulting in negative reported
free operating cash flow (FOCF). We expect additional debt of €300 million-€500 million per year from 2019-2021 to
fund these investments. Despite solid earnings growth, this will somewhat weaken our adjusted credit metrics for the
group. Compared with 2018, we expect adjusted funds from operations (FFO) to debt to weaken by 1%-2% over the
next two-to-three years following this higher capital expenditure spending.

Planned debt funded acquisition of Lekkerland contributes to Rewe's convenience offering and logistical capabilities but
weakens credit metrics further. We believe that the acquisition of the convenience food and tobacco wholesaler
Lekkerland with meaningful logistical capabilities allowing the "Rewe to go" concept to roll out on a larger scale and
developing the so far comparably low-convenience food share in the German food retail market compared with the
U.K. The acquisition also provides the group with additional logistical capabilities (in terms of trucks and warehouses)
to support the general delivery services.
However, the combined effects of higher capex and the Lekkerland acquisition could weaken the existing groups
adjusted pro forma FFO to debt to 23%-24% in 2020 and 2021.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on Germany-based food retailer Rewe Group reflects S&P Global Ratings' view that the group
will continue to defend or strengthen its already sound position in the German and Austrian food retail markets,
resulting in robust sales growth of 4%-5% in 2019 and 2020 and approximately stable underlying margins. In light
of the significant planned capex, we expect reported FOCF will remain negative over the next two years. This,
combined with the planned Lekkerland acquisition, will increase debt and moderately constrain credit metrics,
which should lead to adjusted debt to EBITDA of slightly above 3.0x-3.2x (3.2x-3.3x pro forma Lekkerland) and
adjusted FFO to debt of 24%-26% (23%-24% pro forma Lekkerland) in 2019 and 2020.

Downside scenario
We could lower our ratings if the group's profitability is lower than we expect. This could happen should there be
shortfalls in the more volatile do-it-yourself (DIY) and travel business units, price pressure from multinational
discount retailer accelerate, and there be higher-than-expected costs from Rewe's move into the online food
segment and the integration of Lekkerland. Specifically, we could lower the ratings if our adjusted FFO to debt fell
below 20%.
We could also lower the ratings if cash generation weakened further, owing to accelerated capital spending and
working capital investment, or if we perceive a more aggressive financial policy regarding capital investment or
acquisitions.

Upside scenario
An upgrade is unlikely in the next two years, given the intense competition in Rewe's home market of Germany,
and planned debt-funded acquisition and the expected negative reported FOCF, owing to planned investments in
stores and the online food business. However, we could consider raising our ratings should adjusted FFO to debt
improved sustainably to above 30%, and if management is committed to maintaining this by achieving at least
positive reported FOCF.

Assumptions

• Real GDP to grow by 1.1%-1.3% in the Eurozone in
2019 and 2020 and 0.6% and 1.1% in Germany in
2019 and 2020 respectively, in combination with
continuously low unemployment in Rewe's core
markets, Germany and Austria. We view this as a
moderately supportive macroeconomic
environment.
• CPI will remain at about 1.4% annually in Germany
and 1.1% annually in the Eurozone, which should
limit further upside for consumer spending
moderately. Food prices should increase slightly
more than the overall consumer prices.

• Within the food retail sector, hypermarkets will
continue to face increasing challenges owing to the
shift in consumer spending to convenience and
discount stores. Rewe benefits from this trend,
because the group focuses on midsize supermarkets
and has a sizable discount format--and increasingly
also convenience formats--rather than
hypermarkets.
• Rewe's revenues in its core markets will grow
slightly faster than the food retail market overall, by
4.0%-5.0% in 2019 and 2020 assuming like-for-like
growth of 2.0%-2.5%, in line with the market, and
new store openings focused on Central and Eastern
Europe.
• Reported EBITDA margin will dip to about 3.2% in
2019 after 3.5% in 2018, due to a one-off noncash
positive impact in 2018, and mostly stable
thereafter. This should translate into an S&P Global
Ratings-adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.1%-7.5% over
the next three years compared with 7.7% in 2018.
• Gradually increasing capex of about €2.1 billion in
2019 and €2.2 billion-€2.4 billion per year thereafter
will be fueled by substantial expansions such as
discretionary real estate purchases of leased stores,
store openings, renovation, and investments in new
automated warehouses. We consider the €1.8
billion-€1.9 billion per year in 2017 and 2018 more
typical for a food retailer of this size in Western
Europe.
• With the higher capex, annual negative reported
FOCF will be substantial, at €100 million-€400

million. This, along with increasing store leases, will
result in S&P Global Ratings-adjusted debt
increasing significantly to €14 billion in 2021 from
€12 billion in 2018.
• No material dividends in 2019 and 2020 and
excluding the impact of the Lekkerland acquisition
because it is still subject to regulatory approval.

Base-Case Projections
Robust like-for-like sales growth as main support for earnings and cash flows coupled with store openings in
international markets. Rewe is building on a strong brand with attractive offerings and formats. Its inclusion of private
label products supports like-for-like sales. It is also opening stores in mainly less saturated international markets such
as Eastern Europe.
Intense competition in German food retailing and already-high share of food discounters limit margin upside. While the
increasing sales share of higher-margin organic private label products and increasing sales of higher-margin
convenience food merchandise supports gross margin, we believe the fierce competition from discounters in Germany
and other markets limits further upside on margins over the next three years.
High capex and planned acquisitions increase S&P Global Ratings-adjusted debt. Despite solid earnings growth, high
planned capex and committed acquisition of Lekkerland will drive-up S&P Global Ratings-adjusted debt over the next
two-to-three years and constrains S&P Global Ratings-adjusted credit metrics.

Company Description
Rewe is Germany's second-largest food retailer and the leading supermarket operator in Austria and the Czech
Republic, with over €53 billion in reported annual revenues in 2018. The group generates about 60% of its revenues in
the German food retail segment, the international food retail segment contributes about 27%, and the travel and DIY
segments--mostly in Germany--represent the remaining 13%.
The group operates the majority of its stores on its own. At the same time, the group also supplies independent
retailers in Germany and Austria. In Germany, the group runs a partnership model in the food retailing segment, in
which an independent retailer (holding: 80%) and Rewe (holding: 20%) form a general partnership. This partnership
became a cooperative associate of Rewe, which subleases the stores and equipment to about 1,000 partners.
Retail in Germany (including DIY) accounts for about 64% of group retail revenues, with Austria representing about
14%. The remainder comes largely from sales in the Czech Republic (5%), as well as Italy and Hungary (2% and 1%,
respectively). The group is also present as a food retailer in Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Russia, Slovakia, Lithuania,
and Ukraine. The group is active in the tourism business in Germany, the U.K., the Nordic countries, Switzerland, the
Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
Rewe has a no. 2 market position in German food retailing and a no. 1 position in the Austrian and Czech supermarket
business. The acquisition of Kaiser's Tengelmann stores in Berlin, the sky-supermarkets in northern Germany, and the
partnership with Rewe Dortmund--formerly a stand-alone Rewe retail chain--have strengthened the group's position in
the German retail market and contributed to recent sales and earnings growth. Rewe generates more than 85% of its
revenues in food retail, where spending is somewhat nondiscretionary and less volatile than in non-food retail
segments. The Rewe brand is among the leading brand names in terms of value in the German retail sector, resulting
in high brand recognition.
In our view, Rewe's merchandising strategy is consistent with its strong market position. In the food retail sector, the
company operates by expanding the product lines of regional, organic, and sustainable products in Germany and
internationally. Like other peers in the European food retail sector, Rewe focuses on expanding its share of its own
private label products, which generally command higher margins than branded products. The group's strong revenue
base and widespread network enable it to test and expand new retail concepts, such as its "Rewe-to-go" convenience
food format. This leads to a successful product and brand positioning, accompanied by good store locations, often in

urban locations where there is high foot traffic.
Rewe is a leader in online food retailing in its core markets of Germany and Austria, offering both delivery services and
in-store pick-up of pre-ordered baskets. The services are available in all of Germany's major metropolitan areas and
being rolled out nationwide. Rewe's investment in more automated logistics and continuous improvement of online
services put the group in a leading position in online food sales, which is becoming more popular in Germany and
Austria.
Our view of Rewe's business is constrained by stiff price competition in Germany, especially from discount operators
Aldi and Lidl, and this effectively caps any meaningful expansion in gross margins of standard grocery products. We
see the discounters move to a higher-end merchandise mix by adding more low-priced, branded products as a
potential threat to Rewe and its discount chain Penny, since Penny's strategy always focused on branded discount
products. Nevertheless, we see Rewe's increasing share of fresh, regional, and organic products as a promising
response to the discounters' move.
Despite its topline growth, we believe that rising personnel expenses, store renovation, and restructuring of acquired
lower-margin stores limit any meaningful improvement in its EBITDA margin, which is in the middle of the 5%-10%
range that we view as average for the food retailers.
The acquisitions and organic revenue growth over the past few years position the group well among the top 10
supermarket chains in Europe, resulting in improved negotiation power with suppliers. We see this further supported
by the established purchasing partnership with supermarket chains Ahold Delhaize in Benelux and Leclerc in France,
which benefit from similar product mixes and proximity of regions without significant overlap. Nevertheless, unlike its
France-based peers Carrefour, Auchan, and Casino, Rewe does not have significant exposure to fast-growing emerging
markets, such as China or Brazil, which limits our view of its diversification.
The group's revenue exposure to the travel and DIY sectors of about 13%, both of which we believe have higher
volatility than food retailing, moderately constrain our view of its business risk. Despite a no. 3 position in the German
DIY market, we see the market as inherently competitive, given the five-to-six similarly strong competitors, low
margins, and being subject to disruption by online players. Rewe's tourism segment is the no. 1 tour operator in the
Czech Republic and no. 2 in Germany, but still smaller compared with peers such as Tui, the market leader in Europe.
In this respect, we value the more asset light nature of Rewe's travel segment compared to Tui, which own airplanes,
hotels, and cruise ships.

Financial Risk: Significant
In 2019, Rewe-Zentralfinanz eG megred with Rewe-Zentral AG (earlier both entities were joint parents).
Rewe-Zentralfinanz eG is now the sole parent of the group. The group's consolidated financial statements include
REWE-Zentralfinanz eG and subsidiaries.
Rewe reports its independent retailers (partners of the cooperative group) as an equity affiliate in the group accounts.
We fully consolidate earnings and include these operations in the adjusted EBITDA, FFO, and cash flow figures. We
believe the partners and the Rewe group's credit risk are closely linked, given the same brand and strategy, shared
group functions, same country of operation, and cross holdings. Moreover, we believe that the group controls cash

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 4, 2019 9

REWE Group

flows generated at the partners to some extent, because its contractually agreed role as provider of stores equipment
and key merchandise supplier for the partners result in its ability to increase prices if needed.
The Lekkerland transaction is subject to regulatory approval. If it proceeds, we expect Rewe to report an increase in
debt and moderately weakening credit metrics compared to our base-case. Pro forma the Lekkerland acquisition, we
forecast adjusted FFO to debt of 23%-24% in 2019 and 2020, which still provides modest headroom under our stated
downgrade trigger of 20% and is only marginally less than our expected FFO to debt of 24%-26% for the existing
group.
In our view, the acquisition and substantial planned capex investments are the main constraints for the rating. The
negative reported FOCF resulting from the high capex will increase adjusted financial leverage, leaving the group with
limited headroom for any operating underperformance. Therefore, we forecast a comparatively weak adjusted
FOCF-to-debt ratio of only 8%-11% in 2019 and 2020. In our view, the recent strong trading in 2018 and the group's
track record of solid earnings growth reduces the overall risk of any unexpected operating underperformance.
We see some part of the investments as important for success, such as the new automated warehouses, store
renovations, and expansion. However, we perceive the annual outlay of about €500 million, mainly devoted to real
estate buy-backs of previously rented stores, as a rather flexible part of the investment program, which can be scaled
back or discontinued if needed to support credit metrics without any business impact. Supporting this is our view of
Rewe's stated financial policy commitment, including a potential reduction of these investments if needed to maintain
an investment-grade rating.

Liquidity: Adequate
The short-term credit rating is 'A-3'. We view the group's liquidity as adequate and mainly limited by the planned
capex. Our liquidity assessment also reflects substantial undrawn committed bank lines and is further supported by the
following:
• We project sources of liquidity, including cash and projected cash flows, will exceed uses by almost 1.3x over the
next 12 months, and will remain near this level for the subsequent 12 months.
• We forecast that net sources of cash will remain positive even if EBITDA declines by 30% from our base-case
operating scenario in the coming year.
• We project sufficient covenant headroom for our estimated EBITDA to decline by 30% without the group breaching
coverage tests.
• We view positively the group's generally prudent risk management and well-established, solid relationships with its
banks.

Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

We estimate sources of liquidity to be about €4.8
billion in the next 12 months, including:

Uses of liquidity should amount to about €3.7 billion
for the next 12 months, including the following:

• About €500 million in available cash and equivalents
as of May 31, 2019;

• Debt maturities and short-term debt instruments of
about €600 million;

• Undrawn committed bank lines of approximately
€1.7 billion;

• Seasonal peak working capital requirement of €300
million-€350 million; and

• Cash FFO of €1.6 billion-€1.7 billion;

• Capex and payments for committed acquisitions of
€2.5 billion-€3.0 billion.

• Working capital inflows of about €70 million;
• Committed asset sales of €70 million-€90 million, in
line with those of previous years; and
• Committed acquisition finance in a similar amount
to contracted acquisitions.

Debt maturities
• 2019: €602 million
• 2020: €40 million
• 2021: €100 million
• 2022: €29 million
• Thereafter: €1.46 billion

Covenant Analysis
Compliance expectations
We expect Rewe will fully comply with the covenant included in its revolving credit facility. In the next two-to-three
years, we anticipate covenant headroom of 35%-45%.

Requirements
The group is required to comply with an adjusted debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of less than 6.15x.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

We do not anticipate environmental and social factors will have a material impact on our ratings. Rewe is exposed
to sustainability of resources, human health, pollution, and waste management, among others. We consider food
retail, the group's largest segment, as the main driver for our ESG analysis.
Rewe faces changing consumer preferences across Europe toward regional, organic, and sustainably produced
food. The group has a strong track record in rolling out private-label products, which have emphasized regional
and organic products (the strongest growing category) in recent years. Rewe Bio has become the largest organic
food brand in Germany.
In conjunction with labor management, the group supports individual entrepreneurship through its cooperative
structure with independent retailers in Germany and Austria, giving independent retailers discretion on
compensation and store-level decisions. This secures a high-quality workforce required for customer-facing tasks
and the company's ability to execute multichannel initiatives to maintain a competitive advantage.
As one of largest retailers in Europe, the company encourages transparent supply chains and logistics with less
waste and energy consumption. Rewe was the first German supermarket to remove plastic bags and cut its carbon
emissions by half since 2006. Governance factors support credit quality and we continue to view management's
expertise and experience positively. The group's financial reporting and transparency is generally in line with those
of other private companies.
