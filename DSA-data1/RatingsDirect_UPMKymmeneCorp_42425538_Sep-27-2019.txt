Large and diversified operations.

Cyclical industry.

Cost efficiency underpinned by large scale and vertical integration. Still-large exposure to structurally declining communication paper.
High cash generation and low leverage.

UPM is exposed to some cyclicality, despite its large and diversified operations. With over €10 billion in revenues, it is
one of the largest and more diversified forest and paper product companies that we rate in Europe. Despite capacity
rationalizations and its successful diversification into other forest product areas, communication paper (which is in
structural decline) still accounts for around 44.5% of its external revenues and 20% of EBITDA. That said, UPM is one
of the more cost-efficient graphic paper producers. The group is also exposed to some price volatility in pulp because
around 20% of its pulp output is sold externally (pulp, timber, and biofuels generate about 25% of its revenues).
Cost efficiency is underpinned by large scale and vertical integration.UPM owns forest assets in Finland, Uruguay, and
the U.S. The group sources 80% of its electricity and all of its pulp needs internally. This leads to a very efficient cost
base.
High cash generation and low leverage. The group has historically generated strong cash flows, in excess of €1 billion
per year. It has a track record of applying excess cash to debt repayments. At year-end 2018, its S&P Global
Ratings-adjusted leverage was very low at 0.4x.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our expectations that UPM's strong and cost efficient market positions will continue to
support strong cash flows. We expect adjusted leverage to remain below 1.5x over the next 24 months, even
though UPM's stated financial policy allows for higher leverage.

Downside scenario
We could lower the rating if UPM's credit metrics deteriorated markedly from current levels such that our
weighted-average ratio of adjusted FFO to adjusted debt fell below 40% and adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA
exceeded 2.5x. While significant headroom currently exists, a deterioration in credit metrics could follow a very
large debt-funded acquisition, capex, or higher shareholder returns, combined with a sharp deterioration in the
performance of the business.

Upside scenario
We could raise the rating if UPM tightened its financial policy and amended its stated maximum leverage ceiling to
reflect a commitment to maintain credit metrics commensurate with a modest financial risk profile. We would
consider this to be equivalent to our adjusted weighted-average FFO-to-debt ratio sustainably above 45% and
adjusted debt-to-EBITDA of less than 2x. We believe this would be in line with a company-reported
debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.5x. We could also raise the rating if we saw a material improvement in the
company's business risk profile, possibly via a further expansion into products with higher margins and stronger
growth prospects.

A--Actual. E--Estimate. F--Forecast.

• A 100-150 bps decline in EBITDA margins in 2019,
driven by margin pressures in pulp and specialty
papers. This will only be marginally offset by modest
margin improvements in energy. We expect margins
in the communications paper business to remain
stable or slightly below 2018 levels.
• Annual capex of €450 million in 2019 of which
around €100 million will relate to investments in
Uruguay. Over 2020-2022 we expect annual capex
to increase to €1.1 billion, split between
maintenance capex (€200 million) and investments
into the new pulp mill in Uruguay and the port
operations (around €900 million).
• Dividends of €693 million in 2019 and €650
million-€700 million in 2020, corresponding to
30%-40% of operating cash flows.
• No acquisitions.

Base-case projections
EBITDA margins. We expect EBITDA margins to decline by 100-150 bps in 2019. In biorefining, we expect a slight
drop in profitability as higher pulp volumes (which in 2018 were undermined by temporary plant shutdowns for
repairs) partly offset the negative impact of lower pulp prices. In communications paper, we expect stable to slightly
declining EBITDA margins for 2019, driven by volume reductions throughout 2019 and price reductions in the second
half of 2019.
Dividend policy. The company's dividend policy is to pay 30%-40% of its operating cash flow to shareholders as
dividends. This year the shareholders received a slightly higher pay-out (50%) as 2018 was an exceptional year. We
expect annual dividend payments to remain at €600 million-€700 million.
Leverage. We do not expect any material debt-funded acquisitions and forecast leverage to remain in the minimal
financial risk category, even if the company decides to proceed with the €2 billion investment in a second pulp mill in
Uruguay.

Company Description
Chart 1

With over €10 billion sales and €1.86 billion EBITDA, UPM is one of the largest and most diversified forest and paper
products companies in the world. The group is listed on the NASDAQ Helsinki stock exchange.
It has leading positions in European publications paper, fine paper, and self-adhesive label materials. It also has large
pulp and energy operations, as well as large manufacturing operations for plywood and sawn timber. UPM's 54
operating plants are spread over 12 countries, primarily in Europe. It has paper production plants in the U.S. and
China, and some pulp capacity in Uruguay.
In 2018, external sales were split between communications paper (44.5%), biorefining including pulp, timber, and
biofuels (21.2%), Raflatac self-adhesive labels for consumer goods (14.2%), specialty papers (11.6%), plywood (4.4%),
energy (1%), and other operations (3.1%).
The group's revenue base is well diversified. Its three most important geographies (in terms of sales) are Germany
(16%), China (11%), and the U.S. (11%). Finland accounts for 8.7% of sales.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
UPM has a conservative business model, focused on being a cost leader in capital-intensive segments such as pulp,
graphic paper, and energy generation.
UPM continuously invests in its asset base to enhance its competitiveness and has historically disposed of
underperforming assets (such as graphic paper machines). Positive rating factors include UPM's large size; leading
market positions; product diversity; vertical integration into wood, pulp, and energy; and diverse customer base. The
business has successfully migrated to higher-margin wood and paper products and decreased its exposure to the
structurally declining publications paper segment. The group limits the interdependency between divisions by
operating them independently and ensuring that they are each profitable on a stand-alone basis.
These strengths are partly offset by the company's still-large exposure to the structurally declining European graphic
paper industry (via its communications paper divisions), and the cyclical nature of the pulp business. The pulp segment
has experienced pricing pressure and excess capacity since November 2018, on the back of lower demand from China.
We expect pulp prices to continue to decline in the short term but note that the large South American pulp producers
are currently trying to stem the price decline with production cuts.

UPM's peers include Mondi Group, SCA, and Holmen AB. Both UPM and Mondi are highly diversified in terms of
products and geographies. Holmen and SCA focus on a narrower product range and have a stronger reliance on their
domestic Nordic markets.
Mondi's EBITDA margins are stronger due to its presence in emerging markets and its strong focus on cost
efficiencies.

Financial Risk: Minimal
UPM's financial risk profile is supported by strong cash flow generation and recently low investments, which have
resulted in a significant improvement in credit metrics in the past four years. The company aims to maintain net debt
to EBITDA at approximately 2.0x or less. At the end of 2018, this ratio was negative (with cash on balance sheet
exceeding gross debt) or 0.4x on an S&P Global Ratings-adjusted basis.
To calculate our adjusted debt credit metrics for year-end 2018, we added €527 million of pension liabilities, €399
million of operating leases, and €90 million of reported lease liabilities.
We also view positively the company's low interest costs and leverage. The company has headroom within its financial
policy, and the credit rating, to undertake a large expansion project or acquisition.
Partly offsetting these strengths is UPM's sometimes volatile cash flow generation, which stems from exposure to
volatile business segments such as pulp and publication paper, where periods of overcapacity can lead to pricing
pressure.

Other Credit Considerations
Because UPM currently has strong cash flow generation and a low level of debt, we assess its financial risk profile as
minimal. However, if UPM does not find suitable growth opportunities in the next two years, its financial policy allows
it to make further shareholder returns via dividend payments or share buybacks. The company's financial target is to
maintain maximum net debt to EBITDA of approximately 2.0x (equivalent to our adjusted net debt to EBITDA of
about 2.25x) or below.
We therefore apply a negative financial policy modifier that adjusts our 'a-' anchor for UPM downward by two notches
to 'bbb', reflecting that leverage could increase materially from what we assume in our base case.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

Environmental and social factors are relevant to Finland-based forest products company UPM, but currently not
material ratings drivers.
The group focuses on sustainable forest management and plants around 50 million trees every year. All of UPM's
forests are certified and 85% of the wood it uses comes from certified forests. Wood harvesting levels are exposed
to changes in weather conditions.
The company increasingly focuses on developing renewable and recyclable materials (including fuels and
chemicals) from bio-based materials. UPM also focuses on using a higher portion of recycled content and energy
efficiencies (via the production of hydro power, nuclear power, and biomass-based energy at its mills). 70% of the
energy UPM uses is renewable, resulting in a leaner cost base and lower waste.
We view governance as a supporting factor for the ratings, reflecting management's experience and expertise,
governance in line with best practices, and the balance of different stakeholders' interests.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
As of June 30, 2019, UPM's capital structure comprised $375 million 7.45% unsecured notes due November 2027
issued by UPM-Kymmene Oyj, €44 million unsecured loans from financial institutions, €562 million lease obligations,
and €179 million in other unsecured debt.

Analytical conclusions
The $375 million 7.45% unsecured notes due 2027 issued by UPM-Kymmene Oyj are rated 'BBB', the same as the
issuer credit rating, as no sources of significant subordination have been identified.

UPM has an indirect share in nuclear power plants operated by TVO through its shareholding in PVO, from which it

buys electricity at cost. UPM's indirect share is 33% in Olkiluoto 1 and 2 and 31% in Olkiluoto 3 (which is currently
expected to start regular electricity operations in July 2020).
Although UPM does not provide a guarantee for any of TVO's debt, all shareholders in TVO are obliged to cover their
proportionate share of TVO's fixed and variable costs related to energy generation, which include interest expenses.
UPM has also indirectly provided funding to TVO in the form of shareholder loans through PVO to help fund a new
third reactor.
Although we acknowledge that UPM benefits from stable electricity, sourced at production cost, we also recognize that
market prices have significantly decreased over the past few years, and that TVO's production costs will increase when
the new reactor comes into operation. Although we do not currently adjust UPM's debt for any of TVO's liabilities, we
continue to monitor the benefit for UPM of its indirect shareholding in TVO versus its obligations and factor the cost of
its electricity into our base case forecasts.
