Limited record of new leadership team

Liquidity has substantially improved. PT Lippo Karawaci Tbk.'s (Lippo) rights issue of US$787.5 million--completed on
July 16, 2019--has significantly improved liquidity. Furthermore, there is approximately US$140 million left over from
the US$150 million bond tender exercise in March 2019, which supplements the firm's liquidity and working capital.
We thus believe that there is sufficient buffer in Lippo's liquidity until it can complete the sale of Puri Mall in the
second quarter of 2020. We expect net cash inflow of US$140 million from the sale of Puri Mall. With all these capital
events, the company will have sufficient holding company (holdco) liquidity to meet rental and interest obligations
over the next 12-18 months.
Revamped leadership team should aid business continuity, but we expect improvement will not manifest until mid-2020.
The significant equity injected via the rights issue buys time for the new leadership team to bring the business back on
a normal track while meeting the interest and rental-expense obligations. We believe management has adequate
expertise and sufficient time to understand the business, and is committed to drive business continuity and growth.
However, the record of successful implementation of business strategy and delivery of operation target remain
untested. Management plans to launch a revised concept for middle-market residential units in mid-2020, which will
further support business continuity and bolster property development earnings post 2020.
Holdco performance and cash flow remain the focus. We believe that Lippo's holdco performance will continue to be
the main driver of the company's credit profile. This is because the bulk of the consolidated entity's debt sits at the
holdco, including US$826 million of rated senior unsecured bonds. At the same time, we believe expansionary capital
spending at two key subsidiaries, PT Lippo Cikarang Tbk. (Cikarang) and PT Siloam International Hospitals Tbk.
(Siloam), prevents them from contributing dividends toward offsetting Lippo's interest payments. Therefore, we believe
the financial performance at the holdco better captures the company's interest-servicing capability.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our expectation that Lippo will have sufficient liquidity and adequate cash flow over the
next 12-18 months, backed by proceeds from the July rights issue and asset sales that are planned over the next
few months.

Downside scenario
We could lower the rating if liquidity at the holdco declines with no prospect of recovery. This may materialize if
Lippo fails to hit--by December 2019--the key benchmarks that it needs to achieve to sell Puri Mall by June 2020,
or if aggressive investments in working capital or expansion lead to a material shortfall between liquidity available
to the holdco and interest servicing requirements.
We could also lower the rating in the event of protracted weakness in the company's property sales in 2020.
Evidence of rating pressure would be a sum of cash balance and cash flows below Indonesian rupiah 2 trillion on
an ongoing basis.

Upside scenario
An upgrade would be contingent upon management demonstrating a consistent operating strategy and the
successful delivery of operational targets over the next two years. The upgrade would also be contingent upon
Lippo showing steady property sales, prudent capital spending, a sound liquidity buffer, and keeping its EBITDA
interest coverage above 2.0x sustainably. An upgrade would also be contingent upon no major debt maturities over
a two-year period.

company labels Urban Homes.
• Sale of Puri Mall to LMIRT for IDR3.7 trillion to be
completed in first half of 2020. We expect the net
cash inflow of the sale to be IDR2.0 trillion, by
factoring in Lippo's potential subscription for LMIRT
shares, if LMIRT funds the sale with a rights issue.
• Lippo's holdco revenue to be about IDR2.9 trillion in
2019, peaking in 2020 at IDR6.8 trillion backed by
the sale of Puri Mall, before declining to IDR4.2
trillion in 2021 as we do not expect further asset
sales.
• We expect a similar trend for the EBITDA margin,
which we believe will be about 12% in 2019 due to
lackluster sales, about 34% in 2020, as the sale of
Puri Mall results in higher margin than most
property sales.
• We assume recurring revenue from fee-based
businesses--such as hotels, hospitality, and retail
malls--to grow gradually, but equal to the holdco's
recurring sales, general, and administration cash
expenses.
• Capital spending to be IDR610 billion over the next
two years.

Base-case projections
We expect weak 2019 credit ratios due to absence of asset sales and benign property sales. Credit ratios will improve
in 2020 substantially backed by the sale of Puri Mall. The proposed new launch of the Urban Homes project in

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

mid-2020 will only meaningfully benefit credit ratios in 2021, due to the time lag between sales, and revenue and cash
flow recognition.

Company Description
Lippo is the property arm of the Lippo conglomerate and one of the largest listed property groups in Indonesia with
total assets of US$3.8 billion as of June 30, 2019. Lippo's key business divisions include property development,
operation of hospitals, commercial (hospitality and retail malls), as well as managing Singapore-listed Lippo Malls
Indonesia Retail Trust (LMIRT). Lippo mainly targets the Indonesian middle to upper class segment in its property
development and healthcare businesses. Two key listed subsidiaries generate the bulk of Lippo's revenues: Cikarang, a
property developer; and Siloam, the largest hospital operator in Indonesia.

Business Risk: Weak
Lippo has dominant market position and business diversification through subsidiaries Cikarang and Siloam. Despite the
control of both entities, these broader business segments have not translated to stable earnings and cash flows to the
holdco over the past two to three years. This is because both entities' expansion plans limit their ability to upstream
cash to the parent, and we expect this trend will continue over next two years. There will be substantial cash leakage if

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 12, 2019 5

PT Lippo Karawaci Tbk.

the subsidiaries upstream funds via dividends, given the significant minority interests in both entities.
At the same time, Lippo's business is highly dependent on the Indonesian market, and thus carries concentration risk.
This has adversely affected the company's operating performance in the property sector, where conditions are weak.
At the holdco level, Lippo has not launched significant new projects over the past 18 months. We expect holdco
property performance to remain soft in 2019 given the absence of project launches. As of the end of June 2019, Lippo's
holdco achieved IDR384 billion in property sales, meeting 41% of our full year expectation.
We expect the company to launch its Urban Homes project in mid-2020, with annual property sales of about IDR2
trillion over the next two to three years. The proposed launch, if successful, should support Lippo's cash flow and
EBITDA recognition post 2020.
Lippo's hospital segment, being the largest private hospital operator in Indonesia, has yielded strong growth in its bid
to capture Indonesia's fast-growing demand for healthcare. However, aggressive investment into the business has
wiped out free operating cash flows, and will continue to do so, as Siloam remains in a ramp-up phase. In addition,
Siloam's lower margins relative to the group's property development arm have translated into lower consolidated
margins compared with other domestic property developers.

We view PT Alam Sutera Realty Tbk., PT Modernland Realty Tbk., PT Pakuwon Jati Tbk., and Vingroup Joint Stock
Co. as close peers of Lippo.
Lippo has a better business diversification than generic domestic peers, due to its recurring income from retail malls
and hospital segments. Nevertheless, Lippo's diversified businesses through subsidiaries fail to translate into better
earning quality at the holdco level. All Indonesian developers are exposed to concentration risk in the Indonesian
property market, which has performed poorly in recent years.
We believe both Lippo and Vingroup JSC, Vietnam's biggest property developer, have established brand equity in their
respective markets, commanding premium prices to their product launches. Vingroup has diverse income streams
outside of property development, and operates at a larger scale but in a more volatile Vietnam market than Lippo.
In terms of financial position, Lippo's higher leverage than its peers' highlights its history of aggressive debt-funded
expansion, especially in healthcare. The greater contribution from the company's healthcare arm also lowers the
company's consolidated EBITDA. We see similar levels of leverage across regional peers, characteristic of the
capital-heavy property development sector. In contrast, the high proportion of recurrent income and prudent growth
strategies of PT Pakuwon Jati Tbk., a peer Indonesian developer, has pulled that company's debt-to-EBITDA below
3x.

Financial Risk: Highly leveraged
Lippo's financial position is characterized by the holdco's sizable U.S. denominated debt, sizable interest and rental
expenses, and modest operating cash flows.
The US$787.5 million rights issue completed on July 16, 2019, will significantly improve Lippo's holdco cash flow and
liquidity. The Riady family, the controlling shareholder, subscribed to its share of the rights issue--mainly through PT
Inti Anugerah Pratama--though we do not have visibility on the source of funds. We expect the planned sale of Puri
Mall in the first half of 2020 will bolster Lippo's financial and liquidity position. The company has entered into a
conditional sales and purchase agreement with LMIRT and we estimate that it will result in net inflow of about US$140
million. These substantial capital events will help Lippo's business continuity and support Lippo's cash flow until
end-2020. Lippo's cash flow post 2020 will depend on the launch of projects at the holdco level in mid-2020.

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 12, 2019 7

PT Lippo Karawaci Tbk.

Lippo's leverage will improve modestly thanks to debt repayment, but it remains highly leveraged. Lippo has repaid an
US$8.7 million note through a tender offer, a US$50 million bank loan and US$75 million private bond using proceeds
from its rights issue, resulting in total reduction of debt and annual interest obligations of US$134 million and US$12
million, respectively. While this modestly improves its credit metrics, we continue to forecast thin interest serving
capability at the holdco. This is because the company will have limited operating cash flows at the holdco level, and
we expect no dividends from subsidiaries Cikarang and Siloam.

Liquidity: Less than adequate
We assess Lippo's holdco liquidity as less than adequate. This reflects our view that the holdco generates limited
operating cash flows and has a lack of satisfactory standing in credit markets.
In addition, the company is in breach of an incurrence covenant of fixed-charge coverage ratio of 2.0x for its U.S.
dollar denominated notes. Breaching the incurrence covenant does not require immediate payment of the principal but
will hinder Lippo from making additional borrowing in case of liquidity stress.
We expect the holdco's liquidity sources to cover uses by about 1.2x. This is largely driven by Lippo's completed rights
issue and the expected sale of Puri Mall.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

Although we assess Lippo's corporate governance to be neutral to our credit assessment, the company was
associated with the Meikarta project, which faced corruption allegations. Lippo has since sold down its share of the
subsidiary to a minority stake, and the local corruption investigation bureau has indicted the relevant personnel
involved.
Lippo's property development activities expose it to environmental risks, but we do not believe these are material
to the rating. The company has a long record of good development and management of townships in Indonesia. Its
subsidiary Cikarang received three Indonesia green awards in 2017, thanks to its efforts in biodiversity
development, saving water, and pollution prevention.
On the social front, Lippo is frequently engaged in community-giveback programs, from organizing frequent health
awareness seminars to collaborating with other companies within the Lippo group to award scholarships.
However, we do not believe these factors affect the rating.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
Lippo's borrowings are mostly comprised of senior unsecured bonds at the holdco. This includes US$409 million of
7.00% notes due April 2022, and US$417.03 million of 6.75% notes due October 2026. Most debt at Lippo's operating
subsidiaries consists of operating leases.

Analytical conclusions
We equate our ratings on Lippo's outstanding U.S. dollar senior unsecured notes with our 'B-' issuer credit rating on
Lippo. This is because all of the company's assets are located in Indonesia, a jurisdiction where we believe the priority
of claims in a theoretical bankruptcy is highly uncertain due to the weak jurisdictional context.
