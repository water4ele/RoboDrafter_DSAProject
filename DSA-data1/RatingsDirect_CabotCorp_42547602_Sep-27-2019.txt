Overview
Key Strengths

Key Weaknesses

Strong market position in carbon black.

High concentration of revenues in a few cyclical end markets.

Considerable geographic diversity, with about 80% of
revenues derived from outside of the U.S.

The company’s significant footprint in China leads to more exposure to the ongoing
U.S.-China trade war than a less geographically diverse competitor.

Global manufacturing and distribution operations.

Cabot is the most geographically diverse carbon black producer. The company derives roughly 80% of its revenues
from outside the U.S., including about 20% from China. We believe a strong footprint in China is integral, as China has
grown its share over time to become the No. 1 tire producing region country.
We believe Cabot will benefit from its pricing initiatives and renegotiated contracts. Over the years Cabot has
renegotiated contracts to reduce the lag on passing through raw material price increases, and we believe pricing
initiatives have helped somewhat offset the auto weakness in 2019.
We expect the company's financial policies will remain supportive of the current rating. We expect the company will
use free cash flows to fund organic and inorganic growth initiatives, along with its stated intention to return 50% of
discretionary cash flow to shareholders.

Outlook: Stable

S&P Global Ratings' stable outlook on Cabot Corp. reflects our expectation that the company's fiscal 2020 (ending
September) volumes should witness modest growth, in line with GDP growth in key geographies and the global
automotive market. We expect EBITDA margins will increase from expected 2019 levels, as a result of volume
growth, higher margin new product introductions, and benefits from cost reduction and pricing initiatives. As a
result, we expect the company to maintain FFO to debt in the 30% to 45% range. We believe the company will
look to supplement its organic growth with inorganic growth opportunities, while pursuing its stated intention to
return 50% of discretionary cash flow to shareholders.

Downside scenario
We could lower the ratings within the next two years if the company significantly increases its debt to fund
shareholder rewards or its growth initiatives. If this occurs, we would expect credit metrics to deteriorate such that
FFO to adjusted debt falls below 30% on a weighted average basis. We could also consider a lower rating if the
current downturn in the automotive markets is significantly prolonged or worse than we expect. While the
company's current mix of businesses is different that it was in 2009, it still depends heavily on the global tire and
automotive markets. The 2009 global recession had a significantly negative impact on Cabot's earnings and credit
measures, as fiscal 2009 revenues were down 30%, with the majority of that driven by volume declines. In the
event that certain key countries fall into a recession, we believe EBITDA margins could decline by 200 basis points
(bps) or more, along with a moderate drop in revenues compared with our base-case expectations.

Upside scenario
While less likely, we could consider an upgrade within the next two years if volumes and EBITDA are significantly
higher than our base-case expectations, driven by stronger-than-expected GDP growth in key geographies and a
recovery in demand in the automotive tire industry. We believe a resolution in the U.S.-China trade war would
likely be a necessary first step before seeing any potential rebound in the automotive tire market. In such a
scenario, we would expect the company to maintain EBITDA margins of at least 20%, combined with modestly
higher-than-expected revenue growth. To consider an upgrade, we would expect the company to maintain FFO to
debt of above 45% and believe the company's financial policies support these credit measures. Additionally, we
would need to believe, given the company's concentration in the tire industry, credit measures will not drop well
below that threshold for an extended period in a future downturn.

Assumptions

• Low- to mid-single-digit organic revenue growth
over the next two years, supported by Eurozone
GDP growth of 1.1% and 1.3%, U.S. GDP growth of
2.5% and 1.8%, and Asia-Pacific GDP growth of
5.1% and 5.3%, in 2019 and 2020 respectively. We
believe the company will look to supplement its

• West Texas Intermediate (WTI) prices of $55 per
barrel in 2019 and beyond.
• U.S. light-vehicle sales of 16.7 million and 16.5
million units in 2019 and 2020, respectively.
• EBITDA margins to decline into the 16%-17% range
in 2019 driven by a weaker automotive market
affecting volumes and lower unit margins due to a
weaker pricing environment in China. We expect an
improvement in 2020, driven primarily by volume
growth, pricing actions and cost reduction
initiatives.
• Our assumptions are closely tied to crude oil, which
affects offshore drilling activity, freight transit costs,
and the number of tires on the road, as well as
housing starts and construction, key end-markets of
Performance Chemicals.
• No large debt-funded acquisitions or shareholder
rewards.

Company Description
Cabot is a global specialty chemicals and performance materials company currently operating in three segments:
Reinforcement Materials, Performance Chemicals, and Purification Solutions. The company's products are rubber and
specialty grade carbon blacks, specialty compounds, fumed metal oxides, activated carbons, inkjet colorants, aerogel,
cesium formate drilling fluids, and fine cesium chemicals. In June 2019, the company closed the sale of its Specialty
Fluids business to Sinomine (Hong Kong) Rare Metal Resources Co. Ltd.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
Cabot is a global leader in the carbon black segment with considerable geographic diversity--about 80% of fiscal 2018

revenues were from outside the U.S. It is the most geographically diversified major carbon black producer and is
well-positioned to benefit from its footprint in China (which generated more than 20% of the company's fiscal 2018
revenues). China has steadily grown its share of global tire production over the years and has emerged as the leading
tire manufacturer, with approximately a 35% global share in 2018. We believe demand for carbon black will grow in
the low-single-digit-percentage range annually, driven primarily by expected growth in vehicle production, the number
of vehicles on the road (vehicle parc), and increased tire production.
Our assessment of the company's business risk is comparatively better than another commodity chemical companies
such as CF Industries Inc., given its stronger product, end market, and geographic diversity. Since 2007, the company
has grown its Reinforcement Materials EBIT by about 2.5x despite roughly the same carbon black capacity, through a
combination of repositioning toward larger scale assets, higher-value added new products, value pricing, efficiency
improvements, and stricter environmental regulations and enforcement. The chief application for the company's
products is in tire markets across the world. We expect earnings will remain susceptible to downturns in the
automobile industry and economy, though a significant portion of the demand for carbon black is for replacement tires,
which does not directly depend on new automobile production.

Financial Risk: Intermediate
We expect operating rates and EBITDA to gradually improve starting in fiscal 2020, based on our expectations for
limited capacity expansions in the industry over at least the next two years, combined with modest demand growth for
the company's products. We would expect the company to maintain weighted-average FFO to debt in the 30% to 45%
range. We believe the company's financial policies and cash flow prioritization will support organic and inorganic
growth initiatives, while pursuing its stated intention to return 50% of discretionary cash flow to shareholders. When
calculating the company's adjusted debt balances, we net 90% of cash against debt, to reflect our estimate of cash in
jurisdictions where timely access may be an issue or for friction costs related to the utilization of these balances.

Liquidity: Strong
We expect the company's sources of liquidity will exceed it uses by more than 1.5x, and sources minus uses of liquidity
should remain positive even if EBITDA is 30% less than we project. The company's liquidity position has increase in
the first 9 months of fiscal 2019, primarily driven by the repayment of commercial paper through the issuance of
long-term debt, proceeds from the sale of its Specialty Fluids segment and the issuance of a new 300 million Euro
revolver. We believe the company has generally prudent financial risk management given its current credit measures
and leverage targets. As a result of these factors, we assess the company's liquidity position as strong.

Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• As of June 30, 2019, the company had $1.278 billion
available under its revolving credit facilities.

• Moderate seasonal working capital requirements.

• FFO of $465 million to $500 million annually for the
next two years.
• Cash balances of $147 million as of June 30, 2019.

• $230 million to $300 million of capital spending over
the next two years.
• Cash dividends that we expect to gradually increase
from the $80 million level in fiscal 2018.
• We expect the company to complete the amounts
outstanding under its existing share repurchase
authorization in a measured fashion over the next
few years. Cabot repurchased $144 million of shares
in the first nine months of fiscal 2019.

Covenant Analysis
Compliance expectations
The company was in compliance with its total debt to EBITDA leverage covenant with sufficient cushion as of June
30, 2019. We believe the company has ample covenant headroom in the unexpected event that EBITDA declined by
30%.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

We view Cabot's exposure to environmental and social risks as on par with peers in the broader chemicals sector.
Safety of the workforce is a material aspect of our ESG analysis, as the manufacturing and transportation of many
of Cabot's products involve substances that are considered toxic or hazardous. Cabot is one of the leaders in safety
in the chemicals industry, in part evidenced by a drop in their 2018 recordable incident and lost time rates.
However, certain of the company's facilities are currently or may eventually be subject to greenhouse gas emission
regulations. In the future, the company's costs of complying with these regulations could increase, although they
have not had a material impact on the company's business thus far. Additionally, the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency is considering reconsidering the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS), which could
negatively affect demand for products in the company's purification solutions segment, which are used for mercury
removal. We believe this would only have a modest impact on Cabot, as this segment generates its lowest EBITDA
and the company has said it is pursuing strategic alternatives for this segment.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
The company's capital structure consists of senior unsecured debt issued at the rated parent level. As of June 30, 2019,
the company had approximately $1.017 billion in long-term debt outstanding.

Analytical conclusions
We rate Cabot's debt 'BBB', the same as the issuer credit rating, as no significant elements of subordination risk are
present in the capital structure.
