Key Risks

Strong ongoing support from SOE parent in the form of resource
sourcing, political clout, and financing advantage.

High leverage due to aggressive land acquisitions and primary land
development spending to accelerate growth.

Future supply of saleable resources supported by sizable land bank
under both primary and secondary development.

Geographic concentration risk in its home markets.

Established market position in its home markets of Beijing and Tianjin.

Increasing exposure to unconsolidated joint ventures and associate
projects, leading to weaker financial transparency.

Diversified financing channels and competitive funding costs.

Beijing Capital Land Ltd. (BCL) has been actively building its land bank to accelerate growth. BCL's sales growth fell
behind its peers over 2015-2018 and its national sales ranking dropped to 43rd in 2018, from 23rd in 2015. In response
to its weakening market position, BCL refocused on expansion and actively increased land acquisitions. In 2017-2018,
the company's annual total land acquisitions exceeded 70% of its annual total contracted sales, fueled by substantial
incremental debt financing. BCL has also stepped up investment in primary land development over the past few years.
The company views that as a major source of future supply of saleable resources and hopes to internally absorb 60%
of secondary land generated from its primary development activities. We believe this will further weigh on its leverage
because primary land development has a long cash recycling cycle compared with secondary land investment.

BCL's geographic concentration in Beijing and Tianjin remains, although it now has presence in the Yangtze River
Delta and Greater Bay Area. BCL's current contracted sales remain highly concentrated in its home markets of Beijing
and Tianjin. In the first half of 2019, the two municipalities contributed Chinese renminbi (RMB) 27.8 billion in
contracted sales, accounting for about 68.5% of the company's total contracted sales. In the past two years, BCL has
stepped up investments outside the greater Beijing region, with a strategic emphasis on the Yangtze River Delta and
Greater Bay Area. This has helped to lower the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei share of total land bank to 53% in the first half of
2019, from 67% in 2017. We expect BCL's land bank to become more geographically balanced, but its reliance on the
Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area will persist, with the region accounting for about half of its land bank and sales in the next
two to three years. Such concentration risk will remain a constraint on the company's overall business profile.

We expect an increase in leverage owing to debt expansion and slow revenue growth. In our view, BCL's consolidated
debt-to-EBITDA ratio will stay at 16x-17x in the next 12-24 months, compared with 18x as of end-2018 and 13x as of
end-2017. Due to heightened land investment activities, BCL's absolute debt level has risen dramatically in the past
two years. The company's total debt, including hybrid instruments, increased by RMB28 billion in 2018, which is
around 87% of the company's equity at 2018 year-start. Total debt rose by another RMB20 billion in the first half of
2019, though this was partly owing to the company's efforts to build up a cash buffer as the financing environment for
the property sector has undergone significant tightening this year. On the other hand, the company's revenue and
EBITDA growth have been below our expectations. This was partly because more stringent environmental policies in
the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area have hampered construction progress and project delivery. The rise in BCL's leverage
has also pushed up the overall leverage level of its parent, Beijing Capital Group (BCG).

BCL's significant participation in joint ventures (JVs) weakens its financial transparency. We estimate that about 40%
of BCL's total contracted sales are contributed by JV projects that were not consolidated in the past three years. In
other words, solid growth in the share of profit from associates and JVs should offset earlier sacrifices to topline
growth from 2018. We expect profit contributions from JVs and associates to rise in the next 12-24 months. In
addition, given BCL's relatively low funding cost at the corporate level, it has been providing debt financing to JV
projects and collaboration partners--often with an interest spread. This has helped limit the amount of
off-balance-sheet debt at the JV project level. Based on our estimates, BCL's see-through debt-to-EBITDA ratio after
proportionally consolidating JV projects is about 1x lower than that of the consolidated ratio. However, financial
transparency of the company's participation in JVs is limited; there could be unseen risks, especially with complex
financing arrangements between related parties.

Outlook: Negative

The negative outlook on Beijing Capital Land Ltd. mirrors that on its parent BCG and our expectation that the
company's leverage will stay high with EBITDA growth slower than that of debt.
At the same time, the negative outlook reflects our view that BCG's leverage may rise from its current elevated
level over the next 18-24 months. It also reflects the rising business concentration risk as the group relies more
heavily on the development segment for profit and cash flow contributions, while proportional contributions from
the environmental and infrastructure segments decrease.

Downside scenario
We could downgrade BCL if we lower the rating on BCG. In a less likely scenario, we may lower the rating on BCL
if we believe the company's importance to the group slips, or the group's control of BCL weakens.
We could lower the rating if BCG's equity issuance and growth execution falter, its debt expansion is faster than we
anticipate, or its social housing and primary land development businesses do not generate the desired level of
profit and cash flow, such that its debt-to-EBITDA ratio deteriorates from the current 13x-14x.

Upside scenario
We could revise BCL's outlook back to stable if BCG's outlook stabilizes. This could be indicated by BCG achieving
stronger operating performance and EBITDA growth compared to our base case, while prudently managing debt
expansion such that its debt-to-EBITDA ratio demonstrates a clear improving trend toward 10x.

Assumptions

Key Metrics

• China's real GDP to grow 6.2% in 2019 and 2020.
• China's national contracted sales to increase by
12%-15% in 2019, largely due to a further rise in
average selling price (ASP) of 10%-12% and gross
floor area (GFA) growth of 2%-3%.
• BCL's 2019 contracted sales to grow by 12-13% to
about RMB80 billion, driven by a 10% increase in
contracted sales GFA to 3.4-3.5 million square
meters. ASP to increase up to 2%-3% in 2019.

• Total revenue to increase to RMB26 billion-RMB27
billion in 2019 and to about RMB25 billion in 2020.
This forecast is in line with the company's fast sales
growth in recent years.
• Adjusted EBITDA margin to remain stable at
25%-26% in 2019-2020.
• BCL's land premium cash payments and
construction costs to rise to above RMB35 billion in
2019, following the ramp-up in development scale
and increasing land investments and primary
development capital expenditure (capex).
• Joint ventures to account for about 45% of total
sales in 2019 and 2020.
• BCL's total adjusted debt including perpetuals to
increase to about RMB115 billion in 2019 to support
the company's expansion.

Base-case projections
BCL's revenue to grow moderately in 2019-2020 given the significant proportion of sales from JV projects.Despite the
above 20% increase in annual contracted sales in 2017-2018 and the widening gap between contracted sales and
recognition, for revenue we anticipate a moderate 15% growth in 2019 and below 20% growth as JV projects do not
contribute to the topline. In addition, we believe it is challenging to immediately accelerate the construction process in
the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, given the stringent environmental policies in place.
We expect BCL's margin to remain stable while leverage stays elevated. BCL has stabilized its profitability in the past
two years by focusing on the three key metropolitan areas and exiting some weaker markets. We expect the company
to maintain about 25% adjusted EBITDA margin in the next 12-24 months. However, we believe BCL's debt will
continue to grow in the next two years, albeit less aggressively, such that its debt-to-EBITDA ratio stays above 15x.
This is because meaningful deleveraging is difficult when revenue growth is relatively mild.

Beijing Capital Land Ltd.

Company Description
BCL is a midsize property developer and the real estate development arm of BCG, a Beijing government-owned
conglomerate that has a 54.47% stake in BCL.
Founded in 2002, BCL is mainly engaged in the development and sale of mid-to-high-end residential and commercial
properties. The company also engages in sizable primary land development in Beijing and Tianjin, and operates a
portfolio of large retail outlet stores through its separately listed subsidiary, Beijing Capital Grand Ltd.
Since 2017, the company has embarked on its growth strategy that focuses on the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region,
Yangtze River Delta, and Greater Bay Area with the aim of achieving RMB100 billion total sales in 2020. The company
has been listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange since 2003.

Business Risk: Fair
We expect BCL to maintain its established market position in Beijing and Tianjin, and good margin recovery after its
land bank reshuffle toward higher-tier cities. However, the company faces some geographical concentration risk and
execution uncertainties during its expansion.
BCL has a good market position in Beijing and Tianjin, with a long operating record and satisfactory brand recognition.
In addition, it has some advantage in land procurement in the region because of its primary land development. With its
parent company's state-owned enterprise (SOE) background, BCL has acquired primary land projects in the
Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region with GFA of about 30 million square meters. In the past, it had converted over 80% of its
primary land projects to expand its land bank.
We estimate that BCL will maintain its improved EBITDA margin of 25%-26% in 2019, compared with 23.9% in 2018.
In 2017, the company's EBITDA margin improved to 26.4%, from below 20% in previous years, as it reshuffled its land
bank away from its low-margin lower-tier cities, in particular in northeastern China. In 2018, projects in Beijing,
Shanghai, and Tianjin with good gross margins accounted for about 78% of total contracted sales.
Despite the slight diversification following its expansion, we believe concentration risks remain high because the
company focuses mainly on the six core cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Chongqing, Chengdu, Shanghai, and Shenzhen. That
said, the robust demand in these higher-tier cities partly mitigate the risks. In our view, BCL's execution faces some
uncertainties outside its anchor markets, particularly Beijing and Tianjin. To support its aggressive sales growth, the
company intends to expand into areas where it has yet to establish an operational record.

RMB--Chinese renminbi.

We consider China Jinmao Holdings Group Ltd. (Jinmao) and China Overseas Grand Oceans Group Ltd. (COGO) as
BCL's peers, given similarities in scale and ownership. These developers also have SOEs as their parent group.
BCL's scale is larger than COGO's, but is smaller than Jinmao's. In 2018, BCL, Jinmao, and COGO had sales of
RMB70.6 billion, RMB 128.0 billion, and RMB 45.5 billion, respectively. Jinmao has the most diversified income
stream because of its rental and hotel portfolio with high asset quality; BCL and COGO's primary focus is on property
development. COGO and Jinmao are more geographically diversified with presence in over 20 cities. However, BCL
focuses on higher-tier cities with better demand and higher margins than COGO, which operates only in lower-tier
cities with less attractive markets.
BCL has the weakest leverage compared to peers', given its aggressive growth appetite and low returns in the past few
years due to destocking of inventory in lower-tier cities. However, we expect the company's leverage to improve
modestly in the next 12-24 months as it rebalances its portfolio toward higher-tier cities.

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 27, 2019 9

Beijing Capital Land Ltd.

All the three companies have some parental support. However, COGO and Jinmao's overall credit profiles are stronger
than BCL's, partly because they benefit from the stronger credit profile of their parents, China Overseas Land &
Investment Ltd. and Sinochem Group, respectively. COGO and Jinmao also have lower leverage and a better capital
structure.

Financial Risk: Highly leveraged
We believe BCL is unlikely to materially improve its leverage in the next 12-24 months as the company targets to grow
contracted sales to RMB100 billion in 2020 and RMB140 billion in 2021. We expect BCL to maintain spending on land
acquisitions in the next two years to support its expansion, with land investments staying at about 50% of contracted
sales. In addition, BCL is spending more heavily on primary land development projects in Beijing and Tianjin, which
require significant upfront financing for a lengthy period. We believe the company's operating cash flow will remain
negative over the next two years owing to slower cash collections as credit conditions in China tighten.
BCL has good access to diversified financing channels, thanks to its parental support and SOE background. BCL's
funding costs remain favorable at about 5.45% in 2018, with debt issuances in the domestic bond market still at very
favorable costs. . BCL is also proposing a rights issue plan, which will offer the company's existing shareholders the
right to subscribe for further shares in proportion to such number of shares held. The proceeds of the rights issue plan
is estimated to be about RMB3 billion and may alleviate some pressure on BCL's leverage.

Liquidity: Adequate
We assess BCL's liquidity as adequate. We estimate the company's ratio of liquidity sources to liquidity uses to be 1.9x
over the next 12 months. We believe the high liquidity ratio is temporary as the company has completed a large
amount of financing in the first half of 2019 and has been building up its cash buffer. Given its name sharing with BCG
and SOE status, BCL has good relationships with banks and a good standing in credit markets. The company has
issued over RMB8 billion of private placement domestic bonds in 2019 with an average coupon below 4.5%.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Unrestricted cash of RMB36.9 billion as of June 30,
2019.

• Short-term debt of RMB25 billion maturing in the 12
months to July 2020.

• Cash funds from operations of RMB15 billion in the
12 months to July 2020 prior to land acquisitions.

• Other capex that we estimate at about RMB2 billion;
and acquisitions of about RMB1 billion.

• New issuance of private placement debt securities of
RMB2.1 billion in July 2019.

• Committed or paid land acquisitions of about RMB2
billion since June 2019.

• Planned equity issuances of RMB2.0 billion-RMB2.5
billion by end-2019.

Group Influence
We assess BCL as a highly strategic subsidiary of BCG. The issuer credit rating on BCL is one notch below that on its
parent. The rating and outlook on BCL would move in tandem with those on BCG.
Our assessment of BCG's strong support reflects BCL's importance to the group. BCL is one of the two most important
subsidiaries of BCG and undertakes one of the group's most profitable businesses of real estate development. BCL's
importance also comes from its significant role in supporting the group's revenues and earnings. We estimate that BCL
will continue to make about 50% contribution to BCG's EBITDA over the next two years.
In addition, we expect BCG to support BCL by consolidating all its property-related businesses under the company.
For example, the group could sell its hotel or office properties to BCL to increase the efficiency of the property
business.
