Overview
Key Strengths

Key Risks

Good geographic diversity, which can help mitigate the negative
impact of inclement weather.

Reliance on consumer discretionary spending, which can be volatile
over the economic cycle.

Significant barriers to entry in the market due to the high cost of
developing a theme park near a desirable population center.

A high level of seasonality, which can magnify the effect of extreme
weather events and unexpected sales missteps when they occur.

High EBITDA margin and relatively low volatility of profitability
compared with that of other rated companies in the leisure sector.

International projects make the company vulnerable to additional
operational and reputational risks.

Focus on membership program should help hedge against weather and
seasonality risks.

Continued growth of Six Flags' membership program has helped the company reduce exposure to seasonality risk.The
introduction of the company's multitiered membership program in 2018 caused a shift in Six Flags' customer base, as
some are opting for membership rather than season passes. The number of memberships is up 25% over the second
quarter in 2018. We expect membership to continue to rise and for churn to be relatively low because unlike season
passes, Six Flags does not need to resell the membership to customers after the initial year ends. Six Flags also
recognizes membership revenue monthly (beginning in the second year of a customer's membership). The program
probably will modestly smooth cash flow during the seasonally weak quarters.
Because the parks are outdoors, regional operators face the ongoing challenge of cold weather. In addition, the parks
generate the vast majority of annual EBITDA during the second and third quarters when schools are out of session,
though the revenue generated in the seasonally strongest quarter as a percentage of annual revenue has declined over
time. We also believe the use of the Six Flags brand at all of the company's parks facilitates the membership program
and could give the company a slight advantage over peer Cedar Fair's season pass program. Cedar Fair's parks are
individually branded, which likely led to the company's decision not to offer a membership program.
High-margin international licensing deals have the potential to support EBITDA growth; however, delays are
widespread, and the risk of an accident at an international park not operated by Six Flags could cause brand damage
to the U.S. parks. Six Flags receives fees for design and development as internationally licensed parks are built, and it
will receive a percentage of revenue in return for the use of its brand and management services when the parks open

overseas. However, earlier this year, the Six Flags theme park development in Dubai was discontinued when
development partner DXB Entertainments PJSC decided not to go forward with Phase 2 of the larger planned
multi-park project (which included a Six Flags-branded park). This was because the first phase was not achieving
adequate attendance and was losing money, and the developer no longer deemed the construction of a Six Flags park
as part of Phase 2 a viable use of capital.
Six Flags has four planned parks in Nanjing, China, where construction has been halted until Six Flags' development
partner can reaffirm government approvals to continue construction and eventually operate. However, eight parks in
Qiddiya, Saudi Arabia, and in Haiyan and Chongqing, China, are still under construction. The company expects it will
finalize government approvals to operate the two China locations in the near future. Although these development
projects could eventually generate reliable, high-margin revenue streams, the timing of completion for a number of
developments is uncertain. On top of this, we believe the involvement of outside operators of Six Flags-branded parks
could bring potential safety and reputational risks in the event outside operators fail to follow the same high-quality
safety standards that Six Flags implements in the U.S. This could negatively affect the company's good brand
reputation in the U.S.
Six Flags' 26 North American parks provide good geographic diversity to mitigate against weather risks.The company
continues to perform well, even while navigating one of the rainier years in its history. Six Flags has significant
geographic diversity across North America, which helps moderate the negative impacts of inclement weather. The
company also benefits from relatively high barriers to entry in the market due to the high cost of developing a theme
park near a desirable population center.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects the expectation that good anticipated operating performance and strong liquidity will
offset potential future incremental debt to return capital to shareholders, such that adjusted debt to EBITDA will be
3.5x-4.0x and funds from operations (FFO) to debt will be 20%-25% through 2020.

Downside scenario
We could lower the rating if we expect operating performance to materially deteriorate, or if Six Flags undertook a
debt-financed shareholder distribution that would drive adjusted debt to EBITDA sustainably above 4x.

Upside scenario
A higher rating is unlikely at this time, as we believe management will continue to return capital to shareholders in
a manner that sustains leverage at 3x-4x. We could consider a one-notch upgrade if we became confident Six Flags
would sustain leverage at about 3x or lower.

Assumptions

Key Metrics

• U.S. GDP growth of 2.5% in 2019 and 1.8% in 2020;
• Growth in U.S. consumer spending of 2.5% in 2019
and 2.0% in 2020;
• An average unemployment rate of 3.6% in 2019 and
2020;
• We expect consumer spending growth--combined
with capital investment in new and refreshed rides,
continued uptake of multitiered membership
offerings, the acquisition of new parks, and the
benefit of 365-day operation at the Magic Mountain
theme park--will drive a mid-single-digit percent
increase in attendance in both 2019 and 2020;

• In-park spending per capita likely increases in the
low-single-digit percentage area annually through
2020 as the company continues to increase the mix
of season pass and membership attendance.
Although members may receive free parking and
other discounts on items in the park, they visit more
frequently and have higher overall in-park spending
than nonmembers. This is reinforced by the
increased penetration of the park operator's
all-season dining program.
• Season passholders and members typically attend
parks more frequently than single-day ticket guests,
depressing admissions per capita growth in the
low-single-digit- percentage area annually through
2020.
• This translates to total revenue growth in the
mid-single digits annually through 2020.
• EBITDA margin remains flat in 2019 despite the
improvement in revenue, as the company has
experienced increased costs related to off-season
expenses and rebranding from the parks acquired in
June of last year, including Six Flags Darien Lake,
Splashtown Houston, Wet n' Wild Phoenix, Frontier
City and White Water Bay in Oklahoma City, and
Magic Waters in Rockford, Ill. The company also
faces some incremental headwinds due to
minimum-wage increases in certain markets.
Preliminarily, we anticipate adjusted EBITDA
margin expanding into the low-40% area in 2020
due to the company's growth in its high-margin

international licensing business, and as the company
increases attendance and revenues faster on what is
a largely fixed cost structure. As a result, EBITDA
grows in the mid-single-digit percentages in 2019
and the high single digits in 2020.
• Six Flags uses all excess cash flow for dividends and
share repurchases.

Base-case projections
We anticipate continued revenue growth in the next few years. Following the implementation of Six Flags new
multitiered membership program in 2018, we expect growth to be primarily driven by increasing its number of
members, who are signing up for higher-tiered plans than previously offered through the season pass program, and
acquisitions.
EBITDA growth is supported by expanding revenue faster than the company's high fixed-cost structure. The company's
international licensing agreements are asset light and high margin, though there are underlying risks that come with
development involving outside partners.

Company Description
Six Flags Entertainment Corp. owns and operates regional theme and water parks under the Six Flags brand name.
The company's parks offer various thrill rides, water attractions, themed areas, concerts and shows, restaurants, game
venues, and retail outlets. It owns and operates 26 parks, including 23 parks in the U.S.; two parks in Mexico; and one
park in Montreal, Canada. The company also licenses its brand internationally, and to date it has signed agreements
with partners for 12 parks in China and Saudi Arabia.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
We view the company's high EBITDA margin and low volatility of profitability compared with those of rated
companies in the leisure sector favorably. Partially offsetting these factors is Six Flags' reliance on consumer
discretionary spending, which can be volatile through economic cycles, and high competition in the leisure market for
consumer discretionary time and income. In addition, high vulnerability to seasonality and weather-related risks for Six
Flags' amusement parks compare unfavorably with that of other higher-rated entities in the leisure industry. This is due
to Six Flags facing a compressed operating calendar, consistently generating most of its annual EBITDA during the
second and third quarters. Because the parks are outdoors, together with the compressed operating calendar, the
company faces higher susceptibility to weather than other leisure operators.
However, Six Flags has made an effort to reduce the seasonality that weakens the business. Recently, the company
expanded its Magic Mountain Park to a 365-day operating calendar and rolled-out holiday-themed events at additional
parks. Six Flags has also been growing its membership pass base, which could help smooth cash flow into

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 6, 2019 5

Six Flags Entertainment Corp.

lower-EBITDA-producing operating quarters. The company has also continued to improve its geographic footprint in
North America by acquiring five smaller parks in 2018. It has also increased its international exposure through
asset-light, high-EBITDA-margin licensing agreements with partners in China and Saudi Arabia. Despite the current
high margins in the licensing business, we believe there are potential safety and reputational risks. Some of the
licensed parks should begin to open in 2020.

Peer comparison
Six Flags operates the largest number of parks among--st its closest ratings peers: Cedar Fair and SeaWorld. While
both Six Flags and Cedar Fair operate the majority of their parks in cold winter climates, SeaWorld has a significant
revenue concentration across the warmer climates of Florida, Texas, and California, making it the least exposed to
seasonality of the three peers. SeaWorld, however, has the highest leverage and is still recovering from its reputational
issues. We view Cedar Fair to be the most susceptible to seasonality risk of the three, given its higher concentration of
parks in cold climates. On top of this, Six Flags has been focusing on its year-round membership program, while Cedar
Fair is continuing to focus on season passes. Cedar Fair is also taking on additional debt to fund several acquisitions,
which will bring the company's leverage slightly higher than that of Six Flags, in the low-4x area.

Financial Risk: Significant
Our financial risk profile reflects our expectation for adjusted debt to EBITDA to remain at 3.5x-4x, and FFO to debt to
improve to 20%-25% through 2020. Even though we anticipate the company's park portfolio will generate EBITDA
growth that would otherwise result in improving leverage, the company has historically raised debt and utilized all
excess cash flow to fund shareholder returns in a manner that maintains debt to EBITDA at 3x-4x.

Liquidity: Strong
We assess Six Flags' liquidity as strong. We expect that sources of liquidity will exceed uses over the next 12-18
months, even if EBITDA underperforms our forecast by 30%. In addition, we expect the company to sustain a good
cushion compared to maximum senior leverage covenant levels in its credit facility. We also expect the company will
likely be able to absorb high-impact, low-probability events without the need for refinancing. We also believe the
company will maintain strong liquidity.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Cash on hand of $114 million as of June 30, 2019;

• Capital expenditures of about $140 million in 2019,
growing slightly in 2020;

• Full availability under the $350 million revolving
credit facility as of June 30, 2019; and
• Our expectation for cash flow from operations of
about $520 million in 2019 and about $540 million in
2020.

• We have assumed dividends of approximately $275
million in 2019, which we expect to grow in line with
cash flow; and
• Share repurchases utilizing all remaining excess cash
flow.

Issue Ratings - Recovery Analysis
Key analytical factors
• Our 'BBB-' issue-level rating and '1' recovery rating on Six Flags' $350 million senior secured revolving credit facility
due in 2024 and $800 million senior secured term loan due in 2026 indicate our expectation for very high
(90%-100%; rounded estimate: 95%, capped) recovery for lenders in case of payment default.
• Our 'BB-' issue-level rating and '5' recovery rating on Six Flags' $1 billion senior unsecured notes due in 2024 and
$500 million senior unsecured notes due in 2027 indicates our expectation for modest (10%-30%; rounded estimate:
20%) recovery for lenders in the event of a payment default.
• Our simulated scenario contemplates a default in 2024 driven by a severe economic downturn and tighter consumer
credit markets, as well as an overall decline in consumer discretionary spending, resulting in substantially reduced
demand for Six Flags' memberships and ticket sales.
• We assume a reorganization following the default, using an emergence EBITDA multiple of 6.5x (consistent with the
multiples we use for other theme park operators) to value the company.
