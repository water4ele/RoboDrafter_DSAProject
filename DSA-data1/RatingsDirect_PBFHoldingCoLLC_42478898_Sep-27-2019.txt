PBF Holding to acquire the Shell Martinez refinery from Shell Oil Products US. We expect the acquisition to modestly
improve PBF's size and scale. PBF has not announced plans to finance the proposed $900 million-$1 billion
acquisition; however, we expect its credit measures to remain in line with the rating.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects S&P Global Ratings' expectation that PBF Holding Co. LLC (PBF) will continue to
operate its five refineries with relatively high utilization. We expect PBF to maintain leverage of about 1x-2x in
2019 but believe that its debt to EBITDA could fluctuate between 1x and 4x through the refining cycle.

Downside scenario
We could lower our rating on PBF if market conditions deteriorate, its operational performance weakens, or the
Chalmette, La. or Torrance, Calif. refineries significantly underperform such that its consolidated total debt to
EBITDA increases above 4x on a sustained basis.

Upside scenario
We could consider an upgrade if we gain increased confidence that the refineries will exhibit good profitability
through various commodity price cycles, the company demonstrates that it can maintain consolidated total debt to
EBITDA of less than 2.5x even during a mid-cycle environment, and subsidiary PBF Logistics significantly
increases its fee-based cash flow from third parties, which would increase the cash flow stability of the consolidated
company.

Our Base-Case Scenario
Assumptions

Key Metrics

• GDP growth of approximately 2.3% in 2019 and
1.8% in 2020;

• Debt to EBITDA of 1.6x in 2019 and 1.4x-1.6x in
2020, which compares with 1.8x in 2018; and

• Average utilization across all of PBF's refineries of
about 90%;

• Interest coverage of 7x-8x through 2020, which
compares with 5.3x in 2018.

• Average gross margin per barrel of about $8 in 2019
and $7 in 2020. 2020 margin could be higher
depending on the benefits from IMO 2020;
• Average operating expenses of about $5.34 per
barrel through 2020; and
• Capital spending of approximately $650 million in
2019 and between $575 million and $625 million in
2020.

Base-case projections
We expect leverage metrics to remain below 2x through 2020. Our expectations for 2019 and 2020 are in-line with
mid-cycle conditions. However, PBF could experience a stronger-than-projected performance in 2020 depending on
the margin benefits from IMO 2020. We expect distributions to depend on cash requirements at parent company PBF
Energy Inc.

Company Description
PBF Holding Co. LLC is a U.S.-based refining company with assets located on the East Coast, Midcontinent, Gulf
Coast, and West Coast regions. PBF owns five refineries with a combined capacity of approximately 884,000 bpd and
a weighted average Nelson Complexity of 12.2. PBF Holding is a subsidiary of PBF Energy Inc.

Business Risk: Fair
PBF Holding's business is characterized by its relatively large size and scale and limited geographic and asset diversity.
PBF is one of the larger independent U.S. refiners with total throughput capacity of 884,000 bpd. PBF's greater
concentration compared with that of its higher-rated peers means that its credit measures rely more heavily on its
ability to avoid unplanned downtime. In addition, PBF's cash flows are more concentrated in refining than those of its
peers, which generate a larger percentage from logistics and retail cash flows.
While PBF has significant refining capacity, its geographic and asset diversity is limited compared to that of peers such
as Valero Energy Corp. and Marathon Petroleum Corp., both of which have around three million bpd of refining
capacity. These two companies have stronger cash-flow diversity from ethanol, logistics, and retail assets mitigating
some of the inherent volatility in the refining sector.

Financial Risk: Significant
We expect PBF to maintain debt to EBITDA of 1.5x-2.0x in 2019. However, given the inherent volatility in its refining
margins, we expect that this metric could fluctuate between 1x and 4x through the refining cycle. Our forecast
assumes capital spending of approximately $650 million in 2019, average utilization of about 90%, and average gross
margin of approximately $8 per barrel.

Liquidity: Adequate
We consider PBF Holding to have adequate liquidity and expect that its sources of liquidity will be almost 3x its uses
for the next 12 months. While this level of coverage could indicate a higher assessment, we limit our assessment of
PBF's liquidity to adequate due to the volatility inherent in the refining industry, which makes absorbing a high-impact
event less likely.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Cash of $156.8 million as of June 30, 2019;

• Capital spending of approximately $650 million in
2019; and

• Funds from operations of about $670 million for the
12 months following June 30, 2019; and
• Average availability of $1.6 billion as of June 30,
2019, on the company's $3.4 billion revolving credit
facility due May 2023.

• Distributions of $65 million over the next 12 months,
though the level of distributions could change based
on the cash requirements at parent PBF Energy Inc.

Group Influence
We expect PBF Energy to continue to enhance the group's logistical capabilities through asset dropdowns to PBF
Logistics and organic growth projects. Our stand-alone credit profile on PBF Holding is 'bb' and we consider it to be a

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 16, 2019 6

PBF Holding Co. LLC

core subsidiary of PBF Energy. The group credit profile does not affect our rating on the company.

Issue Ratings - Recovery Analysis
Key analytical factors
• Our simulated default scenario assumes a prolonged cyclical downturn in the sector when refinery margins are low
and cash flow is constrained. Capital spending for periodic maintenance, upgrades, or regulatory and environmental
requirements during such a downturn could also affect liquidity. We use a discrete asset-value method to value the
refineries.
• We value PBF's refineries based on our view that the industry's future refining margins will be lower. We use an
average value of about $2,000 bpd.

Simulated default assumptions
• Simulated year of default: 2024
• Net enterprise value (after 5% administrative costs): $1.7 billion

Simplified waterfall
• Collateral value available to unsecured creditors: $1.7 billion
• Senior unsecured debt: $1.3 billion (includes six months of prepetition interest)
• Recovery expectations: 50%-70% (rounded estimate: 65%)
Note: Although the recovery percentage for the unsecured notes is well above 70%, we cap our recovery ratings on
unsecured debt issued by companies we rate in the 'BB' category at '3'.

of a periodic update on a credit rating and related analyses.

To the extent that regulatory authorities allow a rating agency to acknowledge in one jurisdiction a rating issued in another jurisdiction for certain regulatory purposes, S&P
reserves the right to assign, withdraw or suspend such acknowledgment at any time and in its sole discretion. S&P Parties disclaim any duty whatsoever arising out of the
assignment, withdrawal or suspension of an acknowledgment as well as any liability for any damage alleged to have been suffered on account thereof.
S&P keeps certain activities of its business units separate from each other in order to preserve the independence and objectivity of their respective activities. As a result,
certain business units of S&P may have information that is not available to other S&P business units. S&P has established policies and procedures to maintain the
confidentiality of certain non-public information received in connection with each analytical process.
S&P may receive compensation for its ratings and certain analyses, normally from issuers or underwriters of securities or from obligors. S&P reserves the right to disseminate
its opinions and analyses. S&P's public ratings and analyses are made available on its Web sites, www.standardandpoors.com (free of charge), and www.ratingsdirect.com
(subscription), and may be distributed through other means, including via S&P publications and third-party redistributors. Additional information about our ratings fees is
