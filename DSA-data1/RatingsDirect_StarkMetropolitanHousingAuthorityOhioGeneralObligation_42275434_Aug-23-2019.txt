Rationale
S&P Global Ratings assigned its 'A-' rating to the Stark Metropolitan Housing Authority (SMHA), Ohio's series 2019
certificates of participation (COPs). At the same time, S&P Global Ratings assigned its 'A-' issuer credit rating (ICR) to
SMHA. The outlook is stable.
The rating on the COPs reflects our view of SMHA's full-faith-and-credit pledge to lease payments that will flow
through to certificate holders.
The ratings on SMHA reflect the authority's stand-alone credit profile (SACP) of 'bbb+' and our view that there is a
moderate likelihood that the U.S. government would provide timely and sufficient extraordinary support to SMHA in
the event of financial distress.
The rating also reflects our view of the authority's:
• Strong enterprise risk profile supported by strong demand on the affordability in the region and operating
performance;
• Adequate financial risk profile due to Authority's low leverage position and strong liquidity position that would
support to repay debt obligations in a timely manner;
• Good management team, with sound policies and strategy to build stronger asset quality and continue to provide
various social services for tenants.
Offsetting the above-mentioned strengths are what we consider:
• Susceptibility to year-over-year federal funding levels and limited revenue sources, which lead to volatility in
financial performance; and
• Repayment obligations with U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to settle an Office of
Inspector General report.
Given its reliance on government support for approximately 74% of its revenue, the authority is vulnerable to potential
funding cuts from the U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). HUD is the main source of public funding
for affordable housing and, as a federal government entity, is bound to congressional budget decisions. Recent funding

increases alleviate some of the authority's operating risk, maintain consistent levels of financial performance for the
remainder of this year, and sustain the number of households receiving housing vouchers and low income public
housing support.
In 2013, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) published a report concluding that approximately $10.5 million in
operating and capital funds were used on ineligible expenditures. As a result of the findings in the report, SMHA
entered into two repayment agreements with HUD: a Capital Fund Repayment plan and a Low-Rent Public Housing
Repayment plan. The former will be paid through a reduction in annual capital funds over the next 10 years while the
latter will be paid through non-federal funds over the next 38 years. We view the repayment plans with HUD as a
significant weight on the authority from both a financial and strategic standpoint.
SMHA's mission is to provide low-income households with safe, decent, and affordable housing opportunities in Stark
County. It also strives to help residents achieve self-sufficiency and improve their overall quality of life. SMHA serves
over 4,000 families through its low-income public housing and Housing Choice Vouchers (HCV) programs. It
administers 1,643 HCVs, which consist of:
• Standard HCVs,
• Family Unification Program vouchers,
• Moderate rehabilitation vouchers,
• Continuum of Care Rental Assistance vouchers,
• HOME Tenant-base Rental Assistance vouchers,
• Mental Health and Recovery Services vouchers, and
• Veterans Affairs-supported housing vouchers.
The COPs will be issued to finance and refinance the acquisition and installation of energy-saving equipment at 12
properties. COP proceeds will be used to pay capitalized interest during installation periods, debt service reserve fund
sized at six months MADS as well as COP issuance costs. The COPs are backed by SMHA's general revenue pledge.
Debt service is expected to be fully covered by HUD subsidies, specifically the Frozen Rolling Base subsidy.
In our opinion, SMHA has the potential to improve its financial strength and long-term stability, but this will depend
heavily on its ability to:
• Maintain demand for housing stock,
• Maximize resources for public housing redevelopment and the development of mixed-finance housing,
• Find alternative revenue sources, and
• Reduce expenses.

Outlook
The stable outlook reflects what we consider SMHA's strong relationship with the communities it serves and its market
demand, evidenced by the strong need for this housing market segment.
The Authority's strong operational and administrative efficiencies factor into the outlook. However, its dependence on
federal subsidies and grants, as mentioned above, continues to constrain the rating. Key rating factors will reflect
SMHA's ability to:
• Manage its volatile net operating income,
• Engage in various market participants to provide additional income sources, and
• Leverage the necessary resources to carry out its development plans.

Downside scenario
The Authority's inability to maintain existing housing stocks could impair its financial strength during the outlook
period of two years and result in a lower rating. A lower rating is also likely if a negative trend of EBITA interest
coverage below 1x or the liquidity ratio falls below 1.05x.

Upside scenario
Continued efforts to improve Authority's asset could play an integral role in improving SMHA's finances. We could
raise the rating if SMHA were to increase non-HUD revenue sources, and significantly improve its EBITDA to levels
more commensurate with those of higher rated peers.

Comparative Analysis
Table 1 details how SMHA compares in key measurements to its peers. We believe SMHA relies on social housing
activity in the same manner as most traditional U.S. PHAs, whereby federal subsidies provide the primary revenue
stream. SMHA's ratio of HUD subsidies to total revenue has remained steady in recent years, and was 73% in fiscal
2018. Like other cities with high living costs, SMHA is considered to have strong economic fundamentals, providing
low-cost social rent over market rent to meet very high demand for low-rent housing in Canton. SMHA is on par with
its U.S. peers in terms of revenue from social housing activity and vacancy rates. However, its financial performance
(profitability) is weak for a traditional U.S. PHA. Overall, SMHA is in line with its peers in terms of debt and liquidity
profiles.

Extraordinary Government Support
As a government-related entity (GRE) and under our GRE criteria, we view SMHA as having a "strong" link with the
U.S. government based on the government's history of strong credit support for the public housing sector under certain
circumstances. We also view SMHA as having a "limited importance" role to the government, since an SMHA credit
default would only have a limited effect on the government. In accordance with our criteria, and based on the
combined "strong" link and "limited importance" role, we view the likelihood of extraordinary support that may be
available to this GRE when required as moderate.

Enterprise Profile
Industry risk
Our view of the U.S. PHA industry risk translates into a score of '2', combining sub-scores of '2' for cyclicality and
competitive risk, with no adjustment for the government's supportive policies toward the industry. Economic cycles

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

AUGUST 19, 2019 5

Stark Metropolitan Housing Authority, Ohio; General Obligation

are more likely to affect U.S. PHAs than other social service types because real estate fluctuations can change asset
values. Real estate markets also tend to be overbuilt, leading to depressed occupancy rates, rentals, and property
values. However, residential rental markets normally pose less risk relative to other property classes, and U.S. PHAs'
collective focus on affordable housing typically lends further stability. Competitive risk is fairly low due to effective
entry barriers in many jurisdictions, minimal substitution risk, and overall stability in growth and margins. In addition,
ongoing government subsidies, other support, and oversight limit volatility, with the overall importance of the service
delivered, thereby limiting the potential for negative governmental intervention.

Economic fundamentals and market dependencies
Stark Metropolitan Housing Authority was established under Ohio law in 1939 to provide public housing and related
services for Stark County. The Authority receives subsidies, primarily for operations and modernization activities, from
the federal government. HUD, as the primary overseer of PHAs, is responsible for allocating subsidies for all PHAs
nationwide.
Like many PHAs nationwide, regional market demand for SMHA's services exceeds available supply. The Authority
owns and operates 2,544 public housing units; it administers 1,643 HCVs. Based on SMHA data, average social rent as
a percentage of market rent in its main region of operation is approximately 31%, indicating SMHA provides housing
at a deep discount to a low- and moderate-income population.
On the other hand, the county's population is shrinking, at less of a percent on average annually, and the city often falls
in the shadow of the 3-Cs of Ohio (Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Columbus). Although this isn't enough to dramatically
impact our overall assessment of the Authority's economic fundamentals, which we view as very strong, we are
interested in how SMHA will continue to identify and mitigate this weakness going forward.

Strategy and management
Following the report published by the OIG, several key positions in SMHA's management team have experienced
turnover. Most notably, the executive director, Herman Hill, was appointed right as the report was being published and
the authority entered into its recovery plan. Hill possesses over 12 years of public housing experience and has
administered numerous HUD-funded programs and grants. Hill was closely involved in the authority's implementation
of the recovery plan and has made effective hiring and training an important goal of the authority since his
appointment. In 2014, the chief financial officer, Jeffrey Patterson, and the Interim director of planning and
development, Ashley Wright, were appointed. Patterson has several decades of experience in both the public and
private sector. Wright has since taken over as director of planning and director after successfully working to strengthen
SMHA's local partnerships and planning and development. Most recently, Kevin Schaack was appointed director
human resources and risk management in May of 2017. Schaack has over 20 years of human resources experience in
both the private and public sectors. We believe that this turnover, coupled with the OIG report published in 2013,
represent a significant turning point for the Authority. We will continue to monitor changes in the senior management
team and assess its ability to incorporate new opportunities to expand its leveraging capacity, coupled with its efforts
to implement ongoing and planned capital improvements.
We expect senior staff members to continue working closely with one another to meet the Authority's mission and
bring operations and projects into compliance with overall strategic goals. Internal policies and procedures are

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

AUGUST 19, 2019 6

Stark Metropolitan Housing Authority, Ohio; General Obligation

institutionalized and built into the fabric of all SMHA operations. Under HUD guidelines, the Authority operates
through multiple on-site management offices, as opposed to one centralized location, intended to enhance asset
management. The Authority has also been building relationships in the community and partnering with various
organizations, including:
• Ohio Housing Finance Agency;
• Massillon Fair Housing Department;
• Ohio Civil Rights Commission Fair Housing; and
• Ohio Department of Medicaid.
These partnerships seek to transform not only housing in certain neighborhoods, but also in surrounding communities,
to cultivate long-term economic sustainability.
We believe SMHA operates under a defined strategic plan to guide its operations. The Authority's six-member
leadership team includes individuals with various levels of experience. The team meets with the weekly to review
reports from each department and address short-, medium-, and long-term needs.
SMHA is overseen by a five-member board of commissioners. Its members are appointed by the mayor, county
commissioners, probate court, and Stark County Common Pleas Court. One probate court-appointed member must be
a public housing resident, as mandated by the federal Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998. Members
serve five-year terms, with staggered terms allowing experienced members to remain on the board during periods of
transition. The board sets forth the authority's operational policies and procedures, and it meets bimonthly to review
reports and discuss and vote on agenda items, policy changes, and the annual budget.

Asset quality and operating performance
SMHA either owns or operates approximately 2,544 public housing units serving over 4,000 individuals. Like many
other PHAs nationwide, market demand for public housing vastly exceeds available supply. In our opinion, SMHA
demonstrates strong property management efficiencies. One key area in which SMHA exhibits operational strength, in
our view, is its average vacancy rate, which has remained 4% over the past three years. Furthermore, the average
vacancy rate was 3% as of June 2019. The portfolio's average age is around 50 years.
We believe that SMHA has underspent on maintenance based on our assessment of SMHA's housing stock and past
capital expenditures. Although the issuance of the COPs will address much needed maintenance, we believe that the
HUD repayment plans further encumber the authority reducing the available of funds to an aging portfolio. We will
continue to monitor how the authority addressing capital improvements in the coming years.

Financial Profile
Financial performance
Given the HUD repayment plans and lack of diversified funding opportunities (Non-HUD revenue), we have adjusted
the overall risk profile for SMHA one category below our indicative assessment. As SMHA operates within a smaller
county of Ohio, we believe that their local market is less likely to attract investors and other opportunities, and

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

AUGUST 19, 2019 7

Stark Metropolitan Housing Authority, Ohio; General Obligation

therefore be more difficult for the Authority to find alternative funding sources. We believe that these factors coupled
with the Authority's current financial position, put additional strain in the near-term. We will continue to monitor how
SMHA's future development plans affect their financial profile over the coming years.
According to audited financials, EBITDA remained fairly consistent between 2016 and 2018. The authority's income in
terms of EBITDA-to-revenue has remained 9% over the past three years and is comparable with that of traditional U.S.
PHAs. Looking at net operating income, SMHA has operated at a loss--albeit shrinking--over the past three years. We
believe the authority's heavy reliance on federal funding as a percentage of total revenue, coupled with the inherent
uncertainty of future appropriations, continues to impede the rating. Moreover, we expect the steady decline in federal
government spending to persist, significantly burdening the authority's efforts to maintain profitability, operating
income, and perhaps liquidity.

Debt
Total debt outstanding as of fiscal year-end 2018 was $ 20.1 million, down from $22.4 million, in fiscal 2016. The
decrease was partially due to refinancing 2007 serial bonds, issued for renovations at three high-rise buildings, which
occurred in March 2018. In addition, an equipment lease from Fifth Third bank terminated in 2018.
The authority has two component units, each owning and operating separate projects. Alliance Senior Tower LLC
oversees Alliance Tower and Hunter House LLC oversees Hunter House, both of which are multifamily residential
housing projects in Stark County. Both projects are included in SMHA's overall portfolio and provide an additional
revenue source, because the authority earns a management fee.
In connection with the OIG report published in 2013, the authority has entered into two repayment agreements with
HUD. The Capital Fund Repayment agreement will be paid in 10 annual payments through a reduction in the annual
Capital Fund Program. The Low-Rent Public Housing Repayment agreement will be paid in 38 annual payments,
which will be paid through nonfederal funds.
In addition, given the issuance of the COPs, we understand that the authority's liabilities will increase by roughly $3.4
million. In connection with the COP, HUD will provide several subsidies, particularly the rolling base subsidy, to
subsidize the debt service on the COPs.
SMHA's debt-to-EBITDA ratio has improved to 3.5x in 2018 from 4.9x in 2016. Similarly, its EBITDA-to-interest ratio
improved to 7.4x in 2018 from 6.1x in 2016.

Liquidity
SMHA's liquidity has steadily improved from 3.7x in 2016 to 5.4x in 2018, partly reflecting delayed capital funds. Over
the next two years, we project SMHA liquidity sources, including cash from operations, cash and equivalents, and
current investments, will likely be $5.8 million. Furthermore, we expect liquidity uses (including debt service less
noncash working capital) will increase due to additional debt service from debt acquired in 2019 and could average
$1.75 million during the next two years. We conducted stress testing to our liquidity analysis to factor in the potential
impacts of the HUD repayment plans, which we believe may more accurately reflect the authority's liquidity position.
Accordingly, we used the authority's worst performing years in terms of cash flow from operations and working
capital. Despite our stress testing, we project a 3.0x liquidity ratio in two years, which we consider extremely strong.

Financial policies
We believe SMHA's financial policies are formalized but somewhat lacking in terms of specificity. The authority's
liquidity and debt management policies are included in a financial policy handbook but no formal metrics are present.
SMHA's financial management benefits from planning and budgeting, with implementation enhanced through its
financial reporting system. The budget cycle is organized and institutionalized. The board is updated on each project's
performance once a month. Although SMHA does not have a documented investment policy, we understand it is in
compliance with HUD investment guidelines. To date, the authority maintains all investments in money market
accounts and government agency securities. We consider SMHA strong at its current rating level.
