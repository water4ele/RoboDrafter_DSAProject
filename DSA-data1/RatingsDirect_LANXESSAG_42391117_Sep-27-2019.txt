Key Risks

Portfolio realignment expected to result in higher and less volatile
margins.

Debt-funded acquisitions related to the business portfolio realignment
strategy.

Solid market position among the top-three players in the niche and
midsize specialty chemicals business.

Exposure to some cyclical end markets, such as the auto industry, and to
volatile raw material prices.

Well-diversified exposure by geography, with six key end markets
accounting for 75% of revenue.

Operating margins are improving, but still lag the 17% average for
investment-grade, specialty chemical peers.

Improved leverage metrics following 2018 disposal of 50% stake in
ARLANXEO for €1.4 billion.

Credit metrics are exposed to currency movements.

Public commitment to maintaining a solid investment-grade rating.

S&P Global Ratings believes LANXESS' management is committed to preserving its leverage metrics after the
ARLANXEO disposal. The company has made a public commitment to maintaining a solid investment-grade rating.
Furthermore, the current management team has a track record of financial discipline and balance-sheet protection. For
example, in 2016 LANXESS issued a €500 million hybrid bond and suspended share buybacks to lessen the effect on
debt from the €2.4 billion acquisition of Chemtura.
The company's portfolio realignment will bring higher and more stable margins. LANXESS acquired Chemours'
clean-and-disinfect business in 2016 and lubricant additives producer Chemtura in 2017, and exited the volatile and
lower-margin synthetic rubber market following the ARLANXEO disposal in 2018. Furthermore, LANXESS' is focusing
on certain organic growth projects and manufacturing-excellence initiatives. We believe these factors should enable
LANXESS to gradually build a track record of higher and less-volatile profitability over the next few years. However,
we believe adjusted EBITDA margin improvement will be limited in the short term, reaching about 14% in 2020 from
13% in 2017-2018, reflecting softness in some key end markets.
We expect the company's credit metrics to temporarily weaken in 2019 and strengthen in 2020. We expect our key
credit metric, funds from operations (FFO) to debt, to decline to 31%-33% in 2019 before recovering in 2020 to 2018
levels of about 36%. This is largely due to a €200 million share buyback completed in first-half 2019 and higher capital
expenditure (capex) resulting from further investments in reducing bottlenecks. The persistent weakness in the auto
and agricultural sectors is a key downside risk in our base case.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our expectation that LANXESS will keep FFO to debt comfortably above 30%, which
we consider commensurate with a 'BBB' rating.
We do not envisage much rating headroom in the short term. However, the company's August 2019
announcement that it will sell its 40% stake in chemical site service provider Currenta could potentially support
debt reduction and restore rating headroom. The company expects to receive cash proceeds of €780 million (gross
of taxes) in April 2020, however, we understand that it has not decided how it will use the proceeds. In our
base-case scenario we also assume an improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin to about 14% in 2020, up from
13% in 2017-2018.

Downside scenario
We might lower the rating if the ratio of FFO to debt fell below 30% without the short-term prospect of a quick
recovery. In our view, this may happen if LANXESS pursued a large debt-financed acquisition, which we see as the
main risk to the rating. However, we believe that, in such a scenario, the group would likely protect its credit
metrics in light of its commitment to maintain an investment-grade rating.
Prolonged operating pressure associated with a significant reduction of our adjusted EBITDA margin to below 13%
could also lead to a downgrade.

Upside scenario
We could consider an upgrade if LANXESS improved its credit metrics, specifically with FFO to debt comfortably
exceeding 45% and free operating cash flow (FOCF) to debt above 25% on a sustained basis. However, we view
such a scenario as unlikely, since we believe that the company would most likely use any financial flexibility it
gains to increase capex, acquisitions, or shareholder returns.

Assumptions

• GDP growth in the EU of 1.5% in 2019 and 1.6% in
2020, in Germany of 0.6% in 2019 and 1.1% in 2020,
in North America of 2.4% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020,
and in Asia-Pacific of 5.2% in 2019 and 2020.
• A modest revenue decline in local-currency terms,
reflecting persistent weakness in the auto and
agricultural sectors and the termination of
margin-dilutive tolling agreements (particularly in
Specialty Additives). We acknowledge the group's
resilient performance in Advanced Intermediates in
first-half 2019. However, we believe that the
increasingly difficult operating environment may
make it difficult for the company to increase prices.
Currency movements could also weigh on reported
revenue in both 2019 and 2020.

• Reported EBITDA of about €900 million in 2019,
modestly improving in 2020.
• Limited or neutral working capital cash absorption.
• Capex of about €500 million in 2019 and 2020,
mainly for the implementation of debottlenecking
projects.
• About €780 million of proceeds from the sale of the
Currenta stake, gross of taxes.
• Dividends of €80 million-€90 million in 2020 and
2021.
• No acquisitions, but we acknowledge that LANXESS
may pursue external growth in some business
segments.
• Our base-case projections for 2020 do not
incorporate the potential benefits related to the
disposal of Currenta. This is because we understand
that the company has not yet decided how it will use
the proceeds.

Base-case projections
We expect EBITDA margin growth to be limited but less volatile in 2019-2020. The current difficult operating
environment in some key end markets should partially offset the benefit of lower restructuring and implementation
costs, synergies from the integration of Chemtura, the effects of various ongoing debottlenecking and manufacturing
efficiency projects, and termination of margin-dilutive tolling agreements. Therefore, we believe that margin
improvement over 2019-2020 will be limited. Positively, we believe that LANXESS' exit from the volatile and

lower-margin synthetic rubber business should reduce the volatility of future profitability.

Company Description
LANXESS is a German specialty chemicals company that develops and manufactures chemical intermediates,
additives, specialty chemicals, and plastics. At year-end 2018 it reported €7.2 billion of revenue and had about 15,400
employees in 33 countries. Last year, LANXESS sold its 50% stake in ARLANXEO to Saudi Aramco, thus exiting the
synthetic rubber business. In August 2019, the company also announced the disposal of its 40% stake in chemical park
service provider Currenta to increase the company's financial headroom for capital allocation over 2020.
The company operates through four business segments:
• Advanced Intermediates (32% of group revenue as of June 30, 2019), which comprises activities in basic and fine
chemicals, in which the organometallic (chemical compounds bonding an organic molecule and metal) business was
integrated following the Chemtura acquisition.
• Specialty Additives (27%), including the additives manufacturing business.
• Performance Chemicals (20%), the group's application-oriented activities in process and functional chemicals.
• Engineering Materials (21%), which offers a range of engineering plastic compounds and hot-cast prepolymers,
specialty aqueous urethane dispersions, and polyester polyols.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
In our view, LANXESS benefits from its continued transformation into a midsize, well-diversified (by geography and
end markets) specialty chemical company, with market positions among the top-three players in most of its core
businesses. LANXESS' exit from the volatile and lower-margin commodity synthetic rubber business, through the
disposal of the remaining 50% of ARLANXEO, is a key milestone in its transformation journey (see charts 1 and 2).
This divestment should enable the company to gradually build a track record of higher margins and less-volatile
profitability, two important pillars in our assessment of chemical companies' competitive position and business risk.
The 2016 acquisition of Chemours' clean-and-disinfect business, and 2017 acquisition of lubricant additives and flame
retardants producer Chemtura are two key steps in LANXESS' transformation. Management has expressed high
confidence in its guidance of achieving over €100 million of cost synergies related to the Chemtura transaction over
2017-2020. In 2017, LANXESS also restructured and downsized its leather business unit, which has shown
higher-than-average margin volatility in the past. Furthermore, LANXESS is investing in debottlenecking and
terminating some margin-dilutive toll agreements, with the aim of improving margins and accelerating cash
generation.

We believe that these factors should enable the company to gradually build a track record of higher and less volatile
profitability over the next few years. However, we forecast limited improvement in our adjusted EBITDA margin in the
short term, to about 14% in 2020 compared with 13% in 2017-2018, reflecting softness in some key end markets. As
result, LANXESS' profitability gap with investment-grade specialty chemical peers is reducing, but not fully bridged
(see peer comparison below).
Like most specialty chemical companies, LANXESS has exposure to some cyclical end markets, such as the auto and
construction industries. However, it is no longer exposed to the volatile tire business after the ARLANXEO disposal. In
our view, first-half 2019 performance clearly shows that the company's strategic transformation is paying off, while
leading positions in attractive niche markets are almost balancing the softness in the auto sector.
LANXESS is also exposed to volatile raw-material prices, such as oil-derived products and ammonia, which may result
in margin volatility through the cycle. However, this is partly mitigated by the company's good track record of passing
through input costs to product prices.
We understand the company may pursue midsize acquisitions to strengthen its business position. We see this as the
main risk to our ratings if the acquisitions were sizable and the company funded them through debt.
We do not expect a material disruption to the group should the U.K. leave the EU without a deal, due to its limited
U.K. operations.

Peer comparison
LANXESS' peers include Arkema S.A., Clariant AG, Evonik Industries, and Solvay S.A. Arkema and Clariant are more
comparable with LANXESS than Solvay and Evonik, which are larger and have more diverse end markets.
In our view, LANXESS has a better market position than Clariant, which displays better geographic diversity.
LANXESS has a track record of weaker profitability than both Clariant and Arkema, due to lower margins in the
synthetic rubber business and significant restructuring costs. Positively, we expect LANXESS' EBITDA margin to
progressively improve in 2019-2020, but remain below the peer average (see chart 3).
We expect LANXESS' FFO to debt will stand comfortably above 30% in the foreseeable future, which is better than
Clariant's and explains the one-notch rating difference between the two companies. Similarly, Arkema's credit metrics
are better than LANXESS', explaining the one-notch difference between the two.

Financial Risk: Intermediate
Our assessment of LANXESS' financial risk profile reflects the company's improved credit metrics since 2018, fueled
by the disposal of ARLANXEO. We forecast FFO to debt will temporarily weaken to 31%-33% in 2019, compared with
36% last year, before recovering to 2018 levels in 2020. This is largely due to a €200 million share buyback completed
in first-half 2019 and higher capex resulting from further investments in debottlenecking, which should result in higher
debt. We believe capex will stay at about 7% of sales in 2019-2020, which will mean comparatively weaker FOCF over
the next few years (see chart 4). We expect FOCF to debt of 0%-2% in 2019 and 8%-10% in 2020.
Chart 3

We do not include acquisitions in our base-case scenario, but we see them as the main risk for the ratings. LANXESS'
disposal of its 40% stake in Currenta gives the company financial headroom for capital allocation over 2020. We
believe the transaction could potentially support LANXESS in reducing its debt. The company expects to receive cash

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 5, 2019 9

LANXESS AG

proceeds of €780 million (gross of taxes). We understand that LANXESS has yet to decide how it will utilize the
proceeds, but it is considering a number of capital allocation options including debt repayment, organic and external
growth, and dividends. Therefore, we will monitor how LANXESS uses the funds.
We believe LANXESS' top management is committed to preserving enhanced leverage metrics following the 2018
ARLANXEO disposal, including FFO to debt comfortably above 30%. The company has made a public commitment to
maintain a solid investment-grade rating. Furthermore, the current management team has shown financial discipline,
including through the issuance of a €500 million hybrid bond in 2016 to protect credit metrics, and the company has
the flexibility to reduce capex or dispose of assets to strengthen its balance sheet if needed.

Liquidity: Strong
We view LANXESS' liquidity as strong because we expect sources will exceed uses by more than 1.5x over the 12
months from June 30, 2019, and by at least 1.0x in the 12 months thereafter. We factor in the company's demonstrated
access to debt markets and bank financing, and prudent liquidity risk management that enable it to anticipate potential
setbacks and take action to ensure continued strong liquidity. LANXESS has no financial covenants.

Environmental, Social, And Governance
We consider LANXESS' exposure to environmental risk factors as on par with the chemical sector. Climate protection
and energy efficiency are central to the company's sustainability strategy. Even before the Paris climate agreement,
LANXESS formulated concrete environmental goals. By 2025, the company aims to reduce its energy consumption
and specific carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 25% compared with 2015. Based on year-end 2018 data, the company
is on track to reach this target, with direct CO2 emissions 4% lower and indirect emissions at 2015 levels.
Furthermore, the company significantly reduced its emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds, largely
through the disposal of ARLANXEO in 2018.

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 5, 2019 11

LANXESS AG

We believe LANXESS has a good safety record. The company's lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) per million
hours worked stood at 1.4 at year-end 2018, down from 2.0 at year-end 2016. The group aims to reach a LTIFR of less
than 1.0 by 2025. Furthermore, a key aim of the company is to make sure its entire product portfolio is analyzed from a
sustainability perspective, so that it does not pose risks to humans and the environment. As of year-end 2018,
LANXESS' environmental protection provisions, mainly related to soil contamination, stood at €198 million.
From a governance standpoint, LANXESS is fully in line with global best practices and our assessment is neutral to the
rating. Some first- and second-level management variable compensation (below the board level) depends on the extent
to which certain targets are achieved.

We continue to align our issue ratings on LANXESS' senior unsecured debt with the issuer credit rating. The majority
of LANXESS' interest-bearing debt comprises senior unsecured bonds. All of the debt is issued by the parent company
LANXESS. The company issued one hybrid bond in 2016 with a first call date in 2023. Cash and cash equivalents of
about €229 million and unused committed credit lines of €1.25 billion support the group's liquidity position as of June
30, 2019.

Analytical conclusions
With no material priority obligations ranking ahead of the group's senior unsecured obligations, we rate its senior
unsecured debt 'BBB', the same as the issuer credit rating. We rate the subordinate hybrid bond at 'BB+', two notches
below the issuer credit rating, and assign it intermediate equity content. LANXESS' hybrid capitalization ratio stood at
9.9% at year-end 2018.

When calculating our adjusted credit ratios, we add to reported debt as of Dec. 31, 2018, €710 million of pension
liabilities and €142 million of operating leases. However, we net about €1.3 billion of surplus cash and short-term
investments, which we consider available for debt repayment. We also deduct from debt 50% of the hybrid instrument
issued in 2016 and reported as debt, since we assigned it intermediate equity content. Our forecast credit metrics
incorporate total lease liabilities of about €130 million following the implementation of International Financial
Reporting Standards 16, as per the company disclosure in July 2019.
