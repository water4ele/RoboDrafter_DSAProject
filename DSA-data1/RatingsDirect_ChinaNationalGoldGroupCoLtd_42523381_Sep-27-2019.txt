China National Gold Group Co. Ltd. (CNG) will remain a mid-to-large-size miner globally, benefiting from its rich mine
reserves, which provide long-run production visibility. CNG's mined gold production was 40 tons and mined copper
production was 155 thousand tons (kt) in 2018. We expect its gold and copper volume to continue to grow over the
next 12-24 months, given full commercial production at China Gold International's Jiama mine and CNG's two new
mines (Kyrgyzkulu and Kyrgyz Buchuk projects). Furthermore, CNG's gold reserve life of over 40 years--under China's
mineral-measurement standards--is higher than many of its domestic and international peers and provides production
visibility.
CNG's operations have limited geographical and product diversification. CNG operates over 20 mines which mitigates
the risk of unexpected production disruptions at a specific mine. However, most of its mines are located in China
though some are in Kyrgyzstan and the Republic of Congo. CNG has a relatively limited product mix. Gold and copper
each contributed to about 60% and 40% of its mining revenue in the past few years and we expect this trend to
continue. While it exposes CNG to volatility in gold and copper prices, as demonstrated in the past few years, CNG's
integrated business model somewhat offsets its concentration risks. The company's businesses range from mining,
smelting and refining, trading and jewelry retail, which have led to lower volatility in the company's overall profitability
compared to its peers.
We expect CNG to remain a relatively high-cost metal producer. CNG's cost position will remain in the third quartile of
the global cost curve, primarily driven by its relatively low ore grade. Despite CNG's efforts to strengthen cost controls,
we forecast the company's unit cost of gold and copper to rise by 1%-2% per annum in the next two years, given

China National Gold Group Co. Ltd.

higher labor and raw material costs.
CNG will continue with high capital spending plans. The company's budgeted capital expenditure (capex) of Chinese
renminbi (RMB) 10 billion in 2019 is significantly higher than RMB3.7 billion in 2018, mainly due to potential
acquisitions of mining assets to increase production capacity. Mine expansion and technological improvements at its
existing mines will also drive capex higher over the next 12-24 months.
Chart 1

We expect CNG's leverage to remain high. We believe CNG's debt-to-EBITDA ratio will rise to 7.5x-7.7x in 2019, from
6.8x in 2018. This is largely attributable to high capex and the decline in operating earnings due to higher production
costs. However, we anticipate the ratio to decline to 7.2x-7.4x in 2020 owing to lower capex, copper production
growth and strengthening copper prices.

SEPTEMBER 24, 2019 3

Chart 2

We believe reducing leverage will remain one of CNG's top priorities. CNG has been pushing ahead with debt-to-equity
swaps and mixed ownership reform. Zhongjin Jewellery's IPO plan submitted to the China Securities Regulatory
Commission in August 2019 will be credit positive, in our view. However, we have not factored these initiatives into
our base case given the uncertainty in timing and amount.
CNG continues to benefit from potential government support. CNG is one of the largest gold producers in China. As an
important player in the gold industry, CNG participates in industry-related policymaking and consolidation. Hence, we
do not think the company's role can be easily replaced by private-owned enterprises or other state-owned enterprises
(SOEs). The company's credit standing is essential to the central government. The State-owned Assets Supervision and
Administration Commission (SASAC) appoints the company's board members and senior management. Therefore we
assess CNG as having a high likelihood of receiving extraordinary government support in case of financial distress.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our view that CNG's financial leverage will remain high but moderately improve over
the next one to two years due to strengthening copper prices and increasing gold and copper production. We
expect CNG's EBITDA interest coverage to stay comfortably above 2.0x in the next 12-24 months.

Downside scenario
We would lower the rating on CNG if the company's financial performance deteriorates significantly due to weaker
metal prices or higher production costs than we expect. An indication of such deterioration is that the company's
EBITDA interest coverage falls below 2.0x for a sustained period. We may also downgrade CNG if we believe that
the likelihood of extraordinary government support to the company has weakened, which we view as unlikely in
the next 12-24 months.

Upside scenario
We would upgrade CNG if the company can significantly lower its financial leverage such that its debt-to-EBITDA
ratio falls below 4.0x for a sustained period. This could happen if the company can improve its profitability through
further cost reduction, or lower capital spending. We see limited upside in the next 12 months due to CNG's heavy
debt burden.

Buchuk projects and Jiama mine's ramp-up.
• Unit cash cost for mined gold to increase to
RMB196/gram (g) in 2019, from RMB194/g in 2018,
in line with the company's guidance, and then
increase by 2% in 2020 given higher labor and raw
material costs.
• Unit cash cost for mined copper to increase to
RMB35,900/ton in 2019, from RMB35,300/ton in
2018, in line with the company's guidance, and then
remain stable. Our forecast factors in rising labor
and raw material costs.
• Revenue growth of 6%-8% in 2019 owing to the rise
in gold and copper production and metal prices,
versus 5.1% in 2018, and then remain stable.
• EBITDA margin to decrease to 6.6%-6.8% in 2019
due to the rise in production costs, from 7.2% in
2018, and then increase to 6.8%-7.0% in 2020 owing
to higher copper prices and volumes.
• Operating cash flows to decline to RMB3.7
billion-RMB3.8 billion in 2019, from RMB4.1 billion
in 2018, owing to higher costs, and then increase to
RMB3.9 billion-RMB4.0 billion in 2020 owing to
growth in copper production and supportive prices.
• Capex to increase to about RMB10 billion in 2019
given potential mine acquisitions and about RMB4
billion in 2020, excluding possible mergers and
acquisitions spending, from RMB3.7 billion in 2018.

Base-case projections
Revenue to increase by mid-to-high single digit in 2019 while moderating thereafter. We estimate revenue of CNG's
mining and refining segments to grow by 8%-11% in 2019 before moderating from 2020. This is driven by steady
growth in gold and copper output backed by rising copper prices. We estimate revenue of the jewelry and trading
segments will grow by high-single digit of 5%-7% in 2019 primarily due to supportive gold prices, and then remain
stable.
Profitability to remain under pressure. We anticipate CNG's EBITDA margin will slightly decline to 6.6%-6.8% in 2019,
from 7.2% in 2018, owing to increased production costs. In 2020, EBITDA margin will remain at 6.8%-7.0% due to
relatively low mine quality and increased labor and raw material costs.

Company Description
CNG is one of the largest gold miners in China. The company was founded in 2003 and is headquartered in Beijing. It
is wholly owned by the Chinese central government. CNG mainly engages in the mining and refining of gold and
copper. Its other business segments such as commodities trading and jewelry retail are much smaller than the mining
segment in terms of profit contribution because of their thin margins.

Chart 4

Business Risk: Fair
CNG is one of the largest gold miners in China and we view it as a mid-to-large-size miner globally. The company
benefits from its rich mine reserves, which provide visibility on its long-run production. We expect stable gold
production volumes of about 40 tons annually. Copper production will continue to see higher growth of 8%-10% to
about 170kt in 2019 as per the company's guidance. This is mainly owing to the full commercial production of its
Jiama mine phase II expansion and the production commencement of the Kyrgyzkulu project.

SEPTEMBER 24, 2019 7

China National Gold Group Co. Ltd.

We assess CNG to be in the third quartile of the global gold cost curve, due to its relatively low ore grade. In our view,
the company's high production costs relative to its upstream peers offset the positive attributes we ascribe to its
breadth and scale of operations.
CNG's integrated business model mitigates its profitability volatility and enhances its competitive advantage. This has
contributed to lower volatility in the company's overall profitability as compared to its upstream peers and we believe
this will remain the case going forward. The company is one of the largest gold miners in China, and has large
downstream smelting and refining operations, and the largest gold retail network in China. We have therefore assigned
a positive comparable rating analysis.

Chart 5

We view Shandong Gold Group Co. Ltd., Zijin Mining Group Co. Ltd., Yamana Gold Inc., and Polyus PJSC as CNG's
closest peers, given that they are gold miners with similar production scale or cost positions.
CNG's production volume is higher than that of Yamana and Zijin, but lower than that of Shandong Gold and Polyus.
The company has a longer mine life but higher costs than most of its peers. In terms of geographical exposure, CNG's
operations are mainly focused in China and Polyus is focused in Russia. Shandong Gold's major operations are in
China and it also has 15%-20% volume exposure to Argentina. Zijin and Yamana's operations are more geographically
diversified.
CNG's leverage is similar to that of Shandong Gold but higher than that of Zijin, Yamana, and Polyus. The company's
EBITDA margin is lower because of its lower ore grade and thin-margin commodities trading and jewelry retail
businesses. Polyus's profitability is strong owing to its very low production costs driven by output from open pit mines
and cost control measures. Yamana is also a relatively low-cost gold producer with above-average profitability
compared with that of the global upstream mining industry.

CNG is an SOE that is controlled by the Chinese government. In our assessment, the company has a high likelihood of
receiving extraordinary government support in case of financial distress. Shandong Gold is a SOE that is controlled by
the Shandong government. We assess the company as having a high likelihood of receiving extraordinary government
support in case of need. As a result, we assign three notches of rating uplift to CNG and two notches to Shandong
Gold. We see the other peers as private companies.

Financial Risk: Aggressive
We believe CNG will generate lower operating cash flow in 2019 owing to increased operational costs. That said, we
expect its credit metrics to improve slightly from 2020, backed by higher copper prices and volumes. The company's
debt-to-EBITDA ratio will rise to about 7.6x in 2019, from 6.8x in 2018, before improving moderately to 7.2x-7.4x from
2020.
We forecast the company's free operating cash flow will remain negative during the next 12-24 months. This is owing
to sizable capex for acquisitions as well as exploration and technology enhancement at existing mines. We expect
CNG's leverage to stay high as the company has planned large capital outlays related to inorganic expansion in 2019.
Its leverage will decrease in 2020 as we have not factored in any acquisitions in our forecast. CNG's debt level will
remain high, which constrains its financial strength.

Liquidity: Adequate
We assess CNG's liquidity as adequate. We forecast CNG's liquidity sources to exceed its uses by 1.3x over the next 12
months and its net liquidity sources to remain positive even if EBITDA declines by 15%.
CNG's SOE status underpins its solid relationships with banks and good access to capital markets. As of June 30, 2019,
CNG had total bank facilities of RMB225.4 billion, of which RMB176.6 billion is unused. CNG issued one medium-term
note (MTN) and two super and short-term commercial papers (SCPs) in 2019 at a low average coupon rate of 3.38%,
demonstrating the company's good access to capital markets.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Cash and liquid investments of RMB10.5 billion as of
March 31, 2019.

• Short-term debt obligations of about RMB31.7
billion due in the 12 months ending March 31, 2020.

• Estimated funds from operations of RMB4.4 billion
in the 12 months ending March 31, 2020.

• Maintenance capex of RMB2 billion-RMB3 billion
over the same period.

• About RMB31.7 billion of ongoing government
support, in the form of bank credit lines at Chinese
state-owned banks that mature beyond 12 months
and mainly serve to refinance existing short-term
debt.

• Working capital outflow of RMB600
million-RMB700 million over the same period.
• Dividend distributions of about RMB500 million
over the same period.

Government Influence
The rating on CNG includes three notches of uplift due to the high likelihood that the Chinese government would
extend extraordinary support in case of financial distress. Our view is based on the following company characteristics:
• Very strong link with the Chinese government. The central government owns 100% of CNG and we expect no
ownership change in the next 12-24 months. The central SASAC appoints the company's board members and senior
management. Therefore, the government has strong influence on CNG's strategy and business plans. The
government also has procedures in place to continually monitor the company's development. We believe that a
considerable deterioration in the creditworthiness of CNG would negatively affect the Chinese government's
reputation.
• Important role to the government. CNG operates as a profit-seeking entity in the competitive gold and copper
mining and refining industry. It is one of the largest mined gold producers in China. The company represents the
government in formulating various industry regulations and standards through the China Gold Association. It also
plays an important role in consolidating gold assets, both domestically and abroad. As such, we view CNG's credit
standing to be important to the central government.
