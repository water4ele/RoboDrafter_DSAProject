Overview
Key strengths

Key risks

Good position in a consolidated global memory market.

Susceptible to memory supply and demand imbalances with limited
near-term demand visibility.

Provides both DRAM and NAND memory chips to diversified end market
segments.

Challenging pricing dynamic can severely depress gross margins.

Favorable long-term industry fundamentals.

Significant capital expenditure requirements to maintain
technological competitiveness.

Maintenance of a net cash position and solid liquidity consistent with its
publicly committed financial policy.

Potential high swings in free cash flows.

It's critical for the company to preserve a conservative balance sheet. Micron Technologies Inc. has strengthened its
balance sheet during the industry growth stage by substantially reducing debt and subsequently maintaining a net cash
position. Nonetheless, a conservative balance sheet is necessary for a memory company to withstand the sharp
revenue and cash flow declines inherent in a memory market downturn. Micron's total liquidity position consisting of
sizeable cash and investments balances of about $7.9 billion and unutilized revolver capacity of $2.5 billion are critical
funding sources for ongoing capital expenditure (capex) requirements during periods of weak earnings.
Ongoing trade disputes are exacerbating the current memory downturn.Even though memory suppliers have promptly
reduced capital spending to adapt to supply-demand conditions, the ongoing U.S.-China trade dispute, including the
Huawei ban, could prolong the downturn and cause further price erosion. Because memory chip products are
commodities and because of the breadth of Micron's customer base and promising long-term demand for memory
content, we remain positive on Micron's credit profile.

Micron Technology Inc.

Outlook: Positive

The positive outlook reflects our expectation that Micron will maintain cost competitiveness, operational
discipline, and a sizable liquidity position amid the current memory downturn. We also expect the company to
continue to evaluate and adjust capex as needed over the coming year, and as a result generate break-even to
modestly negative free cash flow in fiscal 2020.

Upside scenario
We could raise the rating to investment grade if Micron maintains EBITDA margins of at least 50%, total liquidity
(cash and short- and long-term investments plus revolver availability) of at least 30% of sales, and a net cash
position over the coming year.

Downside scenario
We could revise the outlook to stable if we anticipate Micron's profitability and free cash flows will experience
multiple periods of sharp declines or if Micron returns to a net debt position. This could arise from a more severe
memory industry downturn, or if Micron experiences a delay in technology transitions, weakening its competitive
position. We could also revise the outlook to stable if Micron deviates from its stated financial policy, causing its
total liquidity position to weaken and leverage to rise.

Company Description
Micron is a major global manufacturer of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and NAND flash memory chips.
The company's products are used in an increasingly broad range of applications including mobile devices, network
servers, autos, and other industrial products. On average, DRAM represents about two-thirds of Micron's total sales
and a higher portion of the company's total cash flows. The memory semiconductor industry has consolidated over the
past decade, leaving three main DRAM manufacturers (Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron) and a handful of NAND
manufacturers (Samsung, Toshiba, Western Digital, SK Hynix, and Micron).

Business Risk: Fair
Micron's business risk profile reflects its considerable scale, memory product diversity, and good market position. The
company procures most of its products through internally owned fabrication facilities. Despite the commodity-like
nature of memory products, heavy capital requirements and unique intellectual properties are barriers to entry in this
industry. Increasingly complex process technologies, time to build and equip additional facilities, and lengthy product
qualification processes generally limit new entrants and constrain incumbents' ability to gain significant share.
While the industry remains susceptible to supply and demand imbalances (as witnessed over the past few quarters)

that can lead to rapid price declines and eroding profitability for all participants, it benefits from strong long-term
growth prospects from greater memory chip density to back rapid data creation from various sources. Furthermore,
industrywide profitability levels have also improved substantially since the last downturn from technological
advancements and a more diverse revenue mix.

Micron Technology Inc.

Financial Risk: Intermediate
In July, the company raised $1.75 billion of senior unsecured notes and a $1.25 billion delayed-draw term loan. Micron
intends to use a portion of these proceeds to acquire Intel Corp.'s noncontrolling stake in the IM Flash joint venture
(JV) and repay the debt that the JV owes to Intel. The JV will terminate at the end of October as previously
announced. Our base-case assumptions expect the company to maintain a net cash position at the end of fiscal 2019
and in fiscal 2020. We view Micron's sizable cash and investments, totaling about $8 billion as of May 31, 2019, and
the full $2.5 billion of capacity under its revolver as liquidity support for the business because an industry downturn
could substantially reduce the company's cash flows while it still needs to invest in critical technological
advancements. Over the coming year, as the industry manages through the downturn we expect Micron to deliver
break-even to modestly negative free cash flows. Given its manageable debt load, we expect the company to continue
to adhere to its stated financial policy and approach shareholder returns prudently.

Liquidity: Adequate
We view the company's liquidity as adequate, with sources of cash exceeding uses over 1.2x over the next 12 months.
We also expect that net sources would be positive even if EBITDA declined 15% from current levels.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Cash and short- and long-term marketable
investments totaling about $7.9 billion as of May 31,
2019.

• Working capital outflow of about $500 million.

• Full availability of the $2.5 billion revolver.
• Operating cash flow of about $12 billion in fiscal
2019 and less in fiscal 2020.

• Capex of about $9 billion, net of partner
contributions in fiscal 2019, with the potential to
decline further in fiscal 2020.
• Moderate debt amortization.

Debt maturities
As of May 31, 2019:
• Fiscal 2020: $1.040 billion
• Fiscal 2021: $0 million
• Fiscal 2022: $719 million
• Fiscal 2023: $0 million
• Fiscal 2024 and thereafter: approximately $5.3 billion (includes a $1.25 billion delayed-draw term loan and $1.75
billion of senior notes raised in July this year)

Covenant Analysis
The revolving credit facility has a total leverage covenant of 2.75x and an interest coverage covenant of 3.5x for the
life of the agreement. We expect the company to maintain ample cushion over the coming year.

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 5, 2019 7

Micron Technology Inc.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

We assess Micron's exposure to environmental risk factors to be relevant to our credit analysis, while its exposure
to social and governance factors to be less so. Micron has 12 manufacturing sites located in the U.S., Japan,
Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, and China, and its manufacturing operation is subject to various environmental risks
concerning greenhouse gas emissions, climate change, and hazardous materials and waste. We believe Micron is
more vulnerable to these risks than fabless semiconductor companies because of its extensive in-house
manufacturing capabilities. We also believe the company has an established framework to ensure high standards
on labor, health, and safety at these facilities.
We view the company's management and governance as satisfactory, reflecting management team's experience,
expertise, and ability to adjust its ESG strategies when needed. Micron has an independent board of directors with
no known conflicts of interest. Established under the oversight of its governance and sustainability committee,
Micron also has a separate and cross-functional sustainability council comprising senior leaders cross all functions
of the business. This council forms sustainability policies and measures ranging from environment, people, and
supply chain management, and periodically evaluates their effectiveness and impact on the business on both shortand long-term bases.

Issue Ratings - Recovery Analysis
Key analytical factors
• We value Micron on a going-concern basis using a 6x multiple of our projected emergence EBITDA, reflecting its
scale, memory product diversity, and proprietary technologies.
• We estimate that for Micron to default, EBITDA would need to decline materially because of a steep decline in
memory prices and demand, inability to reduce manufacturing costs, and strained liquidity from high capital
spending requirements.
• We generally cap recovery ratings on unsecured debt by companies in the 'BB' category at '3' to account for the
greater risk of value impairment by an incremental security pledge to raise new debt, as those companies' credit
quality deteriorates before default.

Simulated default assumptions
• Year of default: 2024
• EBITDA at emergence: $2 billion
• EBITDA multiple: 6x
• Revolver is 85% drawn at default

Simplified waterfall
• Net enterprise value (after 5% administrative costs): $11.5 billion

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 5, 2019 8

Micron Technology Inc.

• Senior unsecured debt: $7.6 billion*
• --Recovery expectation: 50%-70% (rounded estimate: 65%)
*Assumes all secured debt will be repaid and security liens removed as stipulated in the credit agreement by the year
of default.
All debt amounts at default include six months' accrued prepetition interest. Collateral value equals asset pledge from
obligors less priority claims plus equity pledges from foreign subsidiaries after foreign debt.
