Key strengths

Key risks

Leading national player in the hazardous waste management space.

Limited organic growth opportunities, due to mature end-markets
served.

High barriers to entry supported by the company's expansive waste
assets, including incinerators and landfills.

Ongoing bolt-on acquisitions and shareholder rewards likely to limit
sustained improvement in credit metrics.

Predictable, stable demand profile, supported by nondiscretionary
nature of service offerings.

Further upgrades are unlikely due to financial policies that don't
support an investment-grade rating.

Stable business fundamental should support modest EBITDA growth and maintain current credit metrics.Steady
hazardous waste volumes combined with improved price/mix and ongoing operational improvement initiatives should
support modest EBITDA growth and maintain credit metrics over the next 12 months.
Future growth is highly dependent on acquisitions. Given the mature nature of its target end markets, Clean Harbors'
organic growth options are limited. Therefore, we believe the company will largely depend on acquisitions for future
revenue growth.
Further upgrades are unlikely due to the company's financial policies. While Clean Harbor's leverage may improve
below 3x, we do not believe the company is committed to maintaining the credit metrics and financial policies
consistent with an investment-grade rating. Therefore, future ratings upside is limited.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our expectations that steady end market demand will support modest EBITDA growth
while maintaining leverage in the 3x-4x range. We expect the company to continue pursuing bolt-on acquisitions
and shareholder rewards, but none that would cause leverage to exceed 4x on a sustained basis.

Downside scenario
Although highly unlikely, we could downgrade the company if we see a sustained decline in operating
performance, such that leverage exceeds 4x with no foreseeable improvement in the near term. This could occur if
sales decline by 400 basis points (bps) and operating margins by 400 bps below our base-case scenario. We could
also downgrade the company if it pursues bolt-on acquisitions or shareholder rewards that result in credit metrics
weakening to the aforementioned levels.

Upside scenario
An upgrade is highly unlikely over the next 12 months. The company is not committed to maintaining financial
policies and credit measures consistent with an investment-grade rating. While leverage may improve to below 3x,
we do not believe the company is committed to maintaining these levels and that it will prioritize acquisitions and
shareholder rewards over improving credit metrics further.

Clean Harbors Inc.

Company Description
Massachusetts-based Clean Harbors is a vertically integrated provider of environmental, industrial, and waste
management services. The company services over 300,000 customers through its North American network of over 100
facilities, which includes nine incinerators and 11 landfills. Clean Harbors operates through two main segments, ES and
SK. ES provides a comprehensive suite of services including industrial cleaning and maintenance, waste packaging and
collection, transportation, and disposal of various hazardous materials. SK provides full lifecycle management of used
solvents and oils, including the collection, processing/refinement, and eventual disposal, recycling, or redistribution of
refined byproducts, such as synthetic oils. The company generated $3.3 billion in sales and $583 million in adjusted
EBITDA for the 12 months ended June 30, 2019.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
Our assessment reflects Clean Harbors' established position as one of the few national players in the hazardous waste
management space, its expansive landfill and incinerator assets, which support high barriers-to-entry, and its
predictable, recurring revenue stream. These factors are somewhat offset by its mature end markets and exposure to
oil price volatility.
The hazardous waste management space has high barriers to entry, and stringent regulations governing the collection
and processing of hazardous products, factors which benefit Clean Harbors' expansive waste disposal network. Per
company estimates, its incinerators account for roughly 60% of total market capacity while its landfill account for
about 30%. The company's landfills and incinerators are a key competitive advantage. New landfills and incinerators
require significant capital investment, multiple years of development, and are subject to extensive regulations. As a
result, most expansions are through existing facilities rather than through greenfield opportunities. These factors
should support steady utilization rates and operating margins across Clean Harbors' landfill and incinerator network.
The company enjoys predictable, recurring demand due to the nondiscretionary nature of its service offerings and
tenured customer relationships. Hazardous waste, such as used cleaning solvents and oils, are a byproduct of various
applications across end markets. As a result, the company serves a broad, diverse customer base, which provides
relatively stable demand through economic cycles. Furthermore, we believe the company's vertically integrated
operating platform and national presence support its tenured customer relationships and market position as a
"one-stop shop" for their waste management needs.
The key risk with Clean Harbors is that we believe long-term top-line growth opportunities are limited. Overall
demand is tied to waste volumes, GDP growth trends, and industrial output. While waste volumes will fluctuate
through the economic cycle, we believe it to be somewhat range bound, given the mature nature of the company's end
markets. As a result, we believe Clean Harbors is primarily a profitability growth story, with improved price mix,
cross-selling, and operating leverage its key drivers. We expect any sustained top-line growth to be through bolt-on
acquisitions.
The company is also susceptible to depressed oil prices. Low oil prices in 2016 hurt ES' operating performance due to

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

AUGUST 15, 2019 4

Clean Harbors Inc.

its exposure to Western Canada oil sands. The company's refined oil products are also vulnerable to lower oil prices
because its synthetic blends compete directly with virgin oils and lubricants.

Peer comparison
The peer group includes other players in the environmental services market, such as US Ecology, Stericycle, and
Advanced Disposal Services. US Ecology is a direct competitor because it offers comprehensive hazardous waste
management services on a national scale. It possesses the largest landfill asset base in the market (estimated at 36%),
which will only increase with its recently announced merger with NRC Group Holdings. Stericycle offers similar waste
management services but covers a larger range of waste streams, including medical disposal and documentation
destruction. Advanced Disposal Services provides collection, transportation, and disposal of nonhazardous waste,
primarily servicing eastern U.S.

Clean Harbors Inc.

Financial Risk: Significant
Our assessment reflects our expectation for modest improvement in operating performance, offset by ongoing
acquisitions and shareholder rewards. Clean Harbors had steady revenue growth of 8% and adjusted EBITDA margin
expansion of 100 bps for the 12 months ended June 30, 2019. This was attributable to acquisition contributions,
modest organic growth in both ES and SK, and improved pricing/waste mix. We expect these factors to support the
company's continued growth over the next 12 months.
Demand in the industrial and chemical end markets is expected to remain steady, which should support flat to modest
top-line growth. We also expect improved pricing/waste mix and ongoing productivity initiatives to support modest
improvement in operating margins.
We expect bolt-on acquisitions and shareholder rewards to take priority over any significant debt reduction. Bolt-on
acquisitions are an important part of Clean Harbors' long-term growth strategy, so we believe it will continue to pursue
external opportunities. Given the company's current issuer credit rating and its leverage of around 3x, we do not
expect any substantial debt reduction over the next 12 months. While the company's leverage may improve to below
3x, we do not believe it is committed to maintaining this level and is more likely to keep leverage in the 3x-4x range.

Liquidity: Strong
We assess Clean Harbor's liquidity as strong. We expect liquidity sources will be about 2.64x uses over the next 12
months and that liquidity sources will exceed uses even if forecast EBITDA declines by 30%. In addition, we expect
the company to apply prudent risk management and to maintain strong relationships with lending sources.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• $259.7 million of available cash as of June 30, 2019;

• Annual debt amortization of $7 million;

• $217 million available under its $400 million
asset-based lending (ABL) facility as of June 30,
2019; and

• Annual working capital outflow of around $30
million;

• Annual funds from operations between $420
million-$440 million.

• Annual capex between $225 million-$235 million;
and
• Annual share repurchases of between $80
million-$90 million.

Debt maturities

Covenant Analysis
Compliance expectations
As of June 30, 2019, the company was in compliance with all covenants. We expect the company to remain in
compliance over the next 12 months.

Requirements
The company's $400 million ABL facility is subject to a springing fixed-charge coverage ratio of 1.0x if the availability
under its ABL facility falls below $40 million.

Issue Ratings - Recovery Analysis
Key analytical factors
• Our simulated default scenario contemplates a default occurring in 2024. We assume weak economic conditions
contribute to lower industrial waste volume, increased competition, all of which would drive negative free cash
flows and cause the company to draw on its ABL facility. Eventually, Clean Harbors would no longer be able to
meet its obligations, precipitating a bankruptcy filing.
• We assume that Clean Harbors would seek covenant amendments on its path to default--increasing interest costs
on its ABL facility and term loan--and anticipate that it will have drawn 60% on its $400 million revolving credit
facility, net of outstanding letters of credit.
• We valued Clean Harbors on a going-concern basis supported by its strong market position.
