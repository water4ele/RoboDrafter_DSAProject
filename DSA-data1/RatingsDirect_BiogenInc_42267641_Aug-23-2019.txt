Key Strengths

Key Risks

High barriers to entry and good pricing power, similar to other branded
pharmaceutical company peers.

Relatively concentrated therapeutic focus in MS (about 75% of
2018 product revenues, i.e., excluding royalty revenues).

Strong profitability even relative to peers (adjusted EBITDA margins of more
than 50%, helped by royalty revenues) which supports strong free cash flow
generation.

Emerging competition in company's key product markets, MS
and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA).

Leading market position in multiple sclerosis (MS), with about 35%-40% market
share.

Significantly less scale (revenues) than most other
investment-grade pharma peers.

Strong credit measures, free cash flow generation, and commitment to
conservative debt leverage, with a track record of maintaining adjusted net
leverage well under 1.5x.

Political pressures on pharmaceutical pricing in the U.S., where
profitability is highest.

Biogen is a highly profitable and innovative biotech company. Biogen benefits from the same high barriers to entry,
good pricing power, and strong profitability as other rated biotech peers such as Amgen Inc. (A/Stable/A-1), Gilead
Sciences Inc. (A/Stable/--), and AbbVie Inc. (A-/Watch Neg/A-1). We view Biogen's business materially less
favorably than most other large global pharmaceutical peers, such as Amgen, in terms of scale and therapeutic
concentration. We view the strength of Biogen's business as broadly comparable to that of Gilead. More specifically,
while we view Biogen as having less scale, higher therapeutic concentration, and a weaker pipeline than Gilead, we
view the variety of products Biogen offers in MS as more diverse than the various generations of Gilead's HIV
products, because we expect Gilead's newer products to cannibalize its earlier versions over time. Biogen's strong
adjusted EBITDA margins (about 55% over the last few years) are similar to Gilead's and other rated biotech peers'
and substantially higher than those of the broader group of big pharma peers (averaging 30%-40%) that primarily focus
on small molecules such as Eli Lilly & Co. (A+/Stable/A-1+), Merck & Co. Inc. (AA/Stable/A-1+), and Pfizer Inc.
(AA/Stable/A-1+). Biotech companies, however, tend to have greater therapeutic concentration than big pharma
peers. For a more detailed discussion, see "Peer Comparison: How Business Strength Varies Across The Top 15
Branded Pharmaceutical Companies," published June 10, 2019.
Biogen has a well-established track record and firm commitment to conservative financial policies.As of June 30, 2019,
Biogen had adjusted net debt leverage of 0.4x (with $6 billion in outstanding debt, $1.4 billion of other debt-like
liabilities, and $4.2 billion of cash and marketable securities, relative to adjusted last-12-months EBITDA of $7.9

billion). This is a strength even relative to many biotech and big pharma peers, in which financial policies tend to be
conservative. The company has not been as active in merger and acquisition (M&A) spending as AbbVie and Celgene
Corp., and Biogen's credit measures are stronger, more comparable to those of Amgen and Gilead. We believe Biogen
is more committed to financially conservative policies than peers, with Biogen demonstrating a strong preference for
internally developed drugs and small acquisitions, and an aversion to sizable M&A opportunities.
Therapeutic and geographic concentration is high.Biogen has a high therapeutic concentration with about 75% of 2018
product revenues from MS-related products, 15% from Spinraza (SMA), 5% from the sale of biosimilars, and 5% from
other collaborations (excluding about $2 billion in royalties from Roche). The company's geographic concentration is
higher than peers' with about 68% of 2018 revenues from the U.S.

Biogen's late-stage pipeline of new products is relatively light and may not be sufficient to sustain revenue growth.
Biogen focuses on internal drug development in the central nervous system (CNS) therapeutic area, with particular
focus in neurology. We view neuroscience as a particularly challenging therapeutic area given the complexity and
weaker understanding of the biology of the brain, as well as the more subjective nature of certain endpoints. Research
and development (R&D) as a percentage of revenue is about 19%, in line with the peer average. Biogen suffered a
major setback in its development pipeline in 2019, when phase 3 clinical trials for the use of aducanumab for
Alzheimer's disease failed to show adequate effectiveness. As of the end of the second quarter of 2019, Biogen's
pipeline included three phase 3 clinical trials (BIIB111 for retinal disorder, Elenbecestat for Alzheimer's, and BIIB093
for LHI Stroke) and one drug (Vumerity) submitted to the FDA for approval.
In June 2019, Biogen completed the acquisition of Nightstar for about $800 million (gene therapy focused on retinal
disorders). Following the disappointment with the aducanumab trial, the company indicated plans to increase its focus
beyond neuroscience to ophthalmology and immunology (e.g., lupus), in addition to the variety of neuroscience
clinical trials focused on MS, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, schizophrenia, and ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) among
other diseases.

Biogen faces significant threats from competition in key therapeutic areas. The FDA's 2016 approval of Biogen's
Spinraza (administered through spinal injection) was a significant medical breakthrough as it marked the first available
treatment for small population of patients with SMA (all types), including infants with the most severe form (type 1)
who generally would not otherwise survive past the age of two. That said, in May 2019 Novartis launched competing
product Zolgensma (a one-time gene therapy treatment) and Roche is collaborating with PTC Therapeutics on another
(oral) treatment.
More broadly, although the company has leading position in MS (about a $23 billion annual market), with a variety of
products to address different types and phases of the disease, this market is very competitive. There are several new
products under development or recently approved by both Biogen and competitors that may influence market share.
For example, the FDA approved Mayzent (Novartis) and Mavenclad (Merck KGaA) in the first half of 2019 and
Ocrevus (Roche) in 2017, and we expect the FDA to respond in the second half of 2019 to Biogen's application for
Vumerity.
In addition, the company is facing a potentially high-impact legal challenge from Mylan to the patent on its largest
product, Tecfidera ($4.3 billion of 2018 revenues; for MS). Mylan argues that the efficacy of the dose was obvious (and
not patentable) based on publicly available information. Although we view this as a material risk, we believe the odds
are in Biogen's favor as it has successfully defended this patent against similar challenges in the past. If successful,
Biogen would have exclusivity through 2028, but if Mylan succeeds it could lead to a loss of exclusivity as soon as
late-2020 (or a settlement that might involve a compromise on the patent expiration date).
The company, in conjunction with Alkermes PLC (which would receive double-digit royalties), has submitted
Tecfidera's successor, Vumerity (a prodrug, i.e. one that converts to the active molecule after ingestion), to the FDA for
approval in February 2019. Vumerity is similar to Tecfidera with a better side effect profile (i.e., with less adverse
gastrointestinal side effects common in early treatment with Tecfidera). While Vumerity may supplant Tecfidera for
new patients, we expect patients already established on Tecfidera would likely remain on it (or the generic equivalent).

There are significant political pressures on pharmaceutical spending in the U.S., where profitability is highest. Given
bipartisan support in the U.S. for a reduction in prescription drug spending, we expect that some combination of
government initiatives will lead to a moderate reduction in pharmaceutical company profit margins over coming years.
At the same time, given the U.S. Administration's support for sustaining future innovation and investment, we expect
the erosion in profitability to only be moderate, leaving the pharmaceutical industry profitable enough to attract capital
to continue funding innovation. While we don't expect any legislation to take effect before late 2020 at the earliest, we
expect the intensification of political pressure to constrain price increases in 2019 and 2020, as it did in 2018, as
industry players seek to maintain good relations with lawmakers and the administration.
In addition, we believe the ongoing consolidation among pharmacy companies, pharmacy benefit managers, and
insurance companies has provided those customers with more negotiating power (e.g., through formularies) which has
been a source of pressure on pharma pricing. We expect this to remain a challenge for pharmaceutical industry
margins over the next few years.

Outlook: Stable

The stable rating outlook reflects S&P Global Ratings' expectation that Biogen will advance early-stage products
through development and clinical trials, maintain or modestly grow revenues, generate substantial cash flows well
in excess of current needs, and maintain adjusted debt leverage below 1.5x over the next few years.

Downside scenario
We could lower our rating on Biogen if its key MS franchise deteriorates significantly due to competitive threats, or
if the company adopts a significantly more aggressive financial policy, resulting in adjusted debt leverage
increasing to more than 1.5x. We believe Biogen has significant capacity, in excess of $10 billion, at the current
ratings for acquisitions, though slightly less for share repurchases.

Upside scenario
We could consider raising the rating if the company reduces its product concentration and broadens its therapeutic
diversity while maintaining a minimal financial risk profile. However, we believe this outcome is unlikely within the
next few years.

Our Base-Case Scenario
We expect modest revenue growth and margin expansion in 2019 with limited growth in 2020 and 2021 as Spinraza,
the company's biggest growth driver, plateaus. We expect the company to deploy cash flow toward dividends, share
repurchases, and small acquisitions and collaborations, maintaining adjusted debt leverage below 1.5x.
Assumptions

• Low- to mid-single-digit growth in the
pharmaceutical industry, significantly lower than
prior years as political and reputational pressures
effectively eliminate the ability to materially raise
prices on existing products.
• We expect Biogen will experience limited revenue
growth and relatively flat EBITDA margins near
recent levels over the next few years.
• Given already conservative debt leverage, we expect
the company to prioritize share repurchases and
tuck-in acquisition over debt reduction, and for the
company to avoid large M&A transactions.

Base-case projections
Revenues and margins will stabilize and remain relatively flat in 2019.We expect low- to mid-single-digit revenue
growth in 2019, driven by Spinraza, as well as growth in the biosimilars business. We expect a modest decline in
revenues in 2020 and 2021 as demand for Spinraza plateaus. Following the cancellation of the aducanumab
(Alzheimer's) trial, the company lacks sufficient near-term revenue growth drivers to offset declines from competition
on mature products over the next few years.
We expect EBITDA margins to remain relatively flat in the mid-50% area, widening slightly in the near term from a
temporary drop in R&D spending following the cancellation of the aducanumab (Alzheimer's) trials, and subsiding
milestone payments on Tecfidera (Fumapharm AG). We expect R&D as a percentage of revenue to average around
19%, in line with peers, as it did in 2018.
Biogen will allocate free cash flow to M&A and shareholder returns rather than to debt reduction.With a conservative
capital structure, and limited appetite for significant M&A, we expect the company to deploy its significant cash
balances toward dividends, share repurchases, and small acquisitions and collaboration agreements, maintaining
adjusted debt leverage below 1.5x.

Company Description
Biogen is a biopharmaceutical company that specializes in the discovery, development, manufacturing, and marketing
of treatments for neurological, autoimmune, and rare diseases. The company has a leading multiple sclerosis franchise,
has recently launched Spinraza, the first treatment for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and has recently indicated plans
to increase its focus beyond neuroscience to ophthalmology and immunology.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
Biogen benefits from the same high barriers to entry, good pricing power, and strong profitability as other rated
pharma peers. The industry is relatively insensitive to the business cycle and benefits from rising incomes and
increasing demand for health care in emerging markets, as well as from the aging U.S. population and especially the
baby boomers (the surge in births between 1946 and 1964), as health care expenditures typically rise with age.
We view the company's business as weaker than that of many large pharmaceutical peers, due to smaller scale, greater
therapeutic concentration, and higher geographic concentration, though very high margins partially offset these
factors.
Biogen has a solid leadership position in the MS therapeutic franchise (about 75% of revenues, excluding royalty
revenues). We estimate Biogen's MS franchise has about 35%-40% market share, with Novartis, Sanofi, Teva, Bayer,
and Roche as primary competitors. We expect limited growth in the company's mature MS franchise in the next
couple of years.
The company launched Spinraza (SMA) in 2017, which supported revenue growth over the last few years, though
growth is now reaching a plateau. The company's recent late-stage failure in aducanumab (Alzheimer's) leaves the
company with few near-term growth drivers, though the company has a robust pipeline of early-stage candidates.

Biogen Inc.

Aside from Biogen's direct product sales, the company receives substantial royalty-like revenue from Roche on Rituxin
(about $1.5 billion in profit share in 2018) and Ocrevus ($500 million in royalties). We expect Roche's royalties to
Biogen (for Anti-CD20, Rituxin, and Ocrevus) to remain steady at about $2 billion annually, as growth in Ocrevus
offsets declines in Rituxin (following the launch of biosimilars to Rituxin in the second half of 2019).
Biogen also has a small business (about $500 million of annual revenues) developing biosimilars to some of the
best-selling biologic drugs, including imraldi (biosimilar to humira), benepali (enbrel), and flixabi (remicade).
Biosimilars have gained significant traction outside the U.S. but are gaining very limited traction in the U.S. Other
companies like Amgen and Pfizer have also increased their investment in biosimilars. For more about biosimilars and
the dynamics in the U.S., see our report titled "Oncology Is A Major Growth Opportunity For Big Pharma, Injected
With Risk," published Aug. 1, 2019.
The life-sustaining and enhancing nature of the company's products and continuous advancements in efficacy, safety,
and reduction in side effects sustain strong profitability, though increasing competition in these therapeutic areas is
introducing more pressure and shortening product life cycles. For example, the FDA approved Mayzent (Novartis) and
Mavenclad (Merck KGaA) in the first half of 2019, and Ocrevus (Roche) in 2017.
Biogen's ability to maintain its competitive position, stable revenues, and at least modest diversification is critical for
the rating. If competitive pressures lead to greater-than-expected erosion of Biogen's MS franchise, our view of the
competitive position may deteriorate, potentially leading to a downgrade.

Liquidity: Exceptional
We assess Biogen's liquidity as exceptional, supported by the company's cash holdings and marketable investments
and ample free operating cash flow. We expect sources of funds to exceed uses by more than 2x, and that the
company will meet our other criteria for exceptional liquidity.

Biogen Inc.

Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• $4.9 billion cash and marketable investments as of
Dec. 31, 2018;

• Annual capital expenditures of about $1 billion; and

• Full availability of a $1 billion revolving credit
facility; and
• About $6 billion of funds from operations in 2019.

• Annual share repurchases of $3 billion to $4 billion,
though we expect the company will generally reduce
repurchases in years with significant spending on
acquisitions.

Debt maturities
As of Dec. 31, 2018, debt maturities were as follows:
• 2019: None
• 2020: $1.5 billion
• 2021: None
• 2022: $1 billion
• 2023: None
• Thereafter: $3.5 billion

Covenant Analysis
The company has a maximum leverage covenant on its revolver of 3.5x. We expect the company to maintain ample
cushion against this test.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

We believe Biogen provides significant societal benefits by investing in the development of safe and effective
life-extending and -enhancing drugs in therapeutic areas such as MS and SMA. In 2018, the company invested $2.6
billion in R&D, about 19% of revenues, in line with the average among peers.
However, increasing scrutiny of pharmaceutical prices in the U.S., which are much higher than in other regions and
have been rising more quickly than inflation, raise social risks that could hamper Biogen's future profitability and
growth.
Moreover, Biogen attracted negative attention for pricing on Spinraza ($750,000 for the first year and $375,000 for
each subsequent year) despite the remarkable societal benefits from this medical breakthrough (the first treatment
for SMA). Despite that, we believe Biogen is relatively progressive with regard to social and environmental
responsibilities. This is evidenced by the company's substantial investment in R&D, the company's focus on
creating value by leveraging its internal expertise in neurology to develop new drugs, and demonstrating
persistence in the risky area of neuroscience, such as clinical trials in Alzheimer's, a risk some peers would not be
willing to tolerate.
Although we expect potential reform to drug pricing in the U.S. may moderately burden company's EBITDA
margins, we expect the significant social benefits provided by Biogen and the industry will lead to a balanced
approach that supports continued investment in R&D and attractive levels of returns and profitability to the
industry.
We view environmental risks as less prominent than social risks, and we believe the company's governance
practices generally support the rating.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
All outstanding debt is issued by the parent entity, Biogen Inc.

Capital structure
Biogen's capital structure consists of about $6 billion of unsecured debt as of Dec. 31, 2018.

Analytical conclusions
We rate Biogen's senior unsecured facilities the same as the issuer credit rating because there is minimal leverage and
there are no material priority claims.
