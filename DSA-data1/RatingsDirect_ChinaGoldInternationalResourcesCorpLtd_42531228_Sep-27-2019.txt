Key Risks

Steady ramp up and long reserve life at Jiama mine provides
production visibility.

Limited product and asset diversity with operations concentrated in a
single geography.

Controlled capital spending to improve free operating cash flow.

High production costs could continue to strain profitability.
Exposure to volatile gold and copper prices.
Financial leverage to remain high.

Increased copper production capacity will support revenue growth.China Gold International Resources Corp. Ltd.
(CGI) achieved commercial production of its Jiama mine series II, phase II expansion, in July 2018, ahead of schedule.
The full commercial production significantly enhanced the company's copper production to a record high of 55,000
tons in 2018. We forecast Jiama's copper production will continue to grow to about 60,000 tons in 2019, based on the
mine's full production capacity and in line with CGI's guidance. Furthermore, Jiama mine's long reserve life of over 30
years reduces pressure on the company to aggressively replace depleting reserves, resulting in production visibility.
Controlled capital spending likely over the next 12-24 months. CGI has budgeted US$90 million-US$120 million capital
expenditure (capex) over the next 12-24 months, compared with US$232 million in 2017. Capex in 2019 and 2020 will
be mainly for operational maintenance and further exploration at the Jiama underground mine to be completed by the
end of 2020.
Product and geographic concentration remains constraints.CGI's product concentration risk exposes the company to
volatile gold and copper prices. CGI's asset concentration also constrains its business strength; the company's
operations are largely dependent on the performance of its two major mines in China. Unforeseeable operating and
geological events pertaining to any of these mines could hit business performance. A series of wall failures in 2017 on
one side of the Changshanhao (CSH) mine temporarily suspended the mine's production, affecting revenue growth
from gold mining in 2018 and 2019. However, the company's increased production capacity and long mine life at the
Jiama mine provide good revenue visibility and offset the impact of the decline in production at the CSH mine.
CGI will remain a relatively high-cost metal producer. We expect the company's cost position will remain on the higher
end of the global cost curve. We forecast CGI's unit cost of gold and copper production to rise by about 13% and 19%,
respectively, in 2019 from already high levels in 2018. The rise in cost in 2019 is primarily driven by declining ore

SEPTEMBER 25, 2019 2

China Gold International Resources Corp. Ltd.

grade at both mines. However, we expect CGI's operational costs to decline in 2020 owing to better utilization of
mining resources and equipment with likely higher ore grade and recovery in Jiama mine. The completion of a new
section of Jiama's underground mine with higher-grade ore by the end of 2020 will further reduce production costs
from 2021.
Leverage to remain high. We expect CGI's debt-to-EBITDA ratio to rise to 9.0x-9.2x in 2019, from 6.5x in 2018,
primarily driven by decline in operating earnings on higher production costs, while total debt remains high. Although
we anticipate credit metrics to improve from 2020 owing to steady growth in gold and copper production, rising
copper price, and improved operational efficiency through cost-cutting measures, CGI's leverage will remain high.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our view that financial leverage of CGI's parent China National Gold Group Co. Ltd.
(CNG) will moderately improve but remain high over the next one to two years. This is due to strengthening
copper prices and increasing gold and copper production. We expect CNG's EBTIDA interest coverage ratio to
stay comfortably above 2.0x over the period.

Downside scenario
We would lower the rating on CGI if we downgrade CNG. Weaker gold and copper prices than we expected, and
higher production costs than we anticipated at CNG, such that its EBITDA interest coverage falls below 2.0x,
would indicate such deterioration.
We could also downgrade CGI if we believe that extraordinary government support to CNG has weakened or if we
believe the importance of CGI to CNG has weakened.

Upside scenario
We would upgrade CGI if CNG can significantly lower its financial leverage such that its debt-to-EBITDA ratio falls
below 4.0x for a sustained period. This could happen if the group sees improving profitability, reduced capex, or
lower debt. We see limited upside in the next 12 months.

• CGI's gold production from the CSH mine to remain
stable at about 145,000 ounces in 2019, versus
145,000 ounces in 2018, and then recover to
150,000-180,000 ounces in 2020 owing to CGI's
implementation of a new pit design at the mine. Our
forecast is in line with the company's guidance.

• CGI's copper production to increase to about 60,000
tons in 2019, from 55,000 tons in 2018, owing to
ramp up of the Jiama mine and in line with the
company's guidance. Production to increase to
60,000-65,000 tons in 2020 as production at the
Jiama mine continues to grow.
• Revenue growth to be 5%-9% in both 2019 and
2020, versus 39% in 2018, owing to increase in
production levels and rising copper prices.
• Unit cash cost for gold to increase to US$850/oz in
2019, from US$750/oz in 2018, in line with the
company's guidance. Cost to decrease by 5% to
US$808/oz in 2020 through cost optimization.
• Unit cash cost for copper to increase to
US$1.62/pound in 2019, from US$1.36/pound in
2018, in line with the company's guidance. The cost
to decrease by 4% to US$1.56/pound in 2020
through cost-cutting measures.
• Capex to decrease to US$120 million in 2019 and
about US$90 million in 2020, from US$132 million in
2018 and US$232 million in 2017.

Base-case projections
Steady growth in profitability likely. We project CGI's EBITDA margin will decline to 22%-24% in 2019, from 34.6% in
2018, mainly due to higher production costs owing to lower-grade ore from both the mines. We anticipate profitability
will recover from 2020 onward, with EBITDA margin of 27%-30%, due to increase in copper and gold production,
higher copper prices, and better cost optimization.

Company Description
CGI is a gold and base metals mining company based in Vancouver, Canada. It is the only overseas operation and
financing platform of CNG, a Beijing-based gold mining enterprise that the State-owned Assets Supervision and
Administration Commission (SASAC) owns.
CGI mainly engages in the exploration, development, and mining of mineral reserves in China. The company currently
operates two mines: the CSH gold mine and the Jiama copper-polymetallic mine.
As of June 30, 2019, CGI has gold reserves of 1.61 million ounces and copper reserves of 2.5 million tons. CSH has a
reserve life of less than 10 years, while Jiama's is 31 years.
The company is listed on both the Toronto and Hong Kong stock exchanges.

Business Risk: Weak
CGI's high operating costs, limited product diversity, exposure to volatile commodity prices, and single geographic
operations are the primary constraints for its business risk profile.
We expect CGI's cost position to remain relatively high on the global cost curves. The company's relatively weak cost
structure is owing to complexities in the exploitation of low grade ore minerals. We estimate that the unit production

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 25, 2019 6

China Gold International Resources Corp. Ltd.

cost of the CSH mine will remain high, given the mine's significant fixed costs and low-grade ore. Unit production cost
of the Jiama mine will also stay high due to low ore grade and recovery rate.
CGI's product and geographic concentration risk is likely to remain. The company's product offerings are largely
limited to gold and copper, and both products persistently contribute over 80% of overall revenue. CGI therefore faces
revenue and earnings compression when commodity prices are low, impacting its cash flow. We anticipate recovery in
CGI's gold mining operations at the CSH mine from 2020 onwards. Meanwhile, the company's product portfolio will
remain reasonably skewed toward copper mining.

We consider IAMGOLD Corp., New Gold Inc. and Eldorado Gold Corp. as close peers for CGI, given that they operate
in the same industry and have similar business risk profiles or cost structures.

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 25, 2019 7

China Gold International Resources Corp. Ltd.

All the peers have limited product diversity. CGI and New Gold operate in copper and gold mining, while IAMGOLD
and Eldorado Gold have operations concentrated in gold mining.
CGI's gold production is lower than that of all of its rated peers while its copper production is higher than New Gold's
following the ramp up of the Jiama mine. CGI's CSH mine life is largely similar to that of IAMGOLD and New Gold's
mines. The mine life of the Jiama mine is comparable to that of two of Eldorado Gold's mines.
CGI, IAMGOLD, and Eldorado Gold have higher cost structures than New Gold, which contributes to New Gold's
above-average profitability.
Leverage remains high for CGI and the peers. IAMGOLD's credit metrics are more favorable in terms of
debt-to-EBITDA ratio and ratio of funds from operations (FFO) to debt. However, its sizable capex will lead to
negative free operating cash flow.
Unlike its peers, CGI is a highly strategic subsidiary of a central state-owned enterprise (SOE). In our view, CGI will
benefit from its group status, with extraordinary government support flowing through its parent in case of financial
stress. Therefore the rating receives four notches of uplift.

Financial Risk: Aggressive
We expect CGI's debt-to-EBITDA ratio to trend higher in 2019 mainly because of higher production costs and
persistent high debt levels. We estimate credit metrics will start to recover from 2020 as costs and capex will decline,
while copper and gold output and copper price will rise. We estimate the company's EBITDA interest coverage will
continue to remain well above 2x over the next 12-24 months.
We expect CGI's free operating cash flows to improve over the next 12-24 months owing to controlled capex. We
believe the company will focus on improving operational efficiency at its mines. We have not factored in any potential
acquisitions in our forecast.

Liquidity: Adequate
We view CGI's liquidity as adequate. We forecast the company's liquidity sources will exceed uses by 1.4x over the 12
months ending June 30, 2020. Net liquidity sources will remain positive even if EBITDA declines by 15%.
CGI has maintained good banking relationships and a generally satisfactory standing in the capital market, in our view.
As of June 30, 2019, the company has total bank facilities of RMB9.5 billion, of which RMB3.3 billion are unused.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Cash and liquid investments of US$175.2 million as

• Maintenance capex of about US$105 million during
the period.
• Working capital outflow of about US$8 million over

Group Influence
We view CGI as highly strategic to CNG as the group's only overseas operation and financing platform. We believe
CGI will receive timely and sufficient support from CNG, when needed. The rating on CGI is therefore one notch
below our rating on CNG.
Our assessment of CGI's importance to the group is based on the following factors:
• We expect CNG to maintain its dominant shareholding of 39.3% in CGI. We believe CGI will remain integral to
CNG's overall development strategy and continue to be the only overseas operation and financing platform of the
group.
• CGI contributes more than 30% of the group's gold output and more than 54.9% of its copper output.
• CGI is unlikely to be sold. The company shares the same name as the group. It is closely linked to the group's
reputation, brand name, and risk management.
• CGI has a strong and long-term commitment of support from the group's senior management team, given the
overlap of the management team. Four of the nine members on CGI's board also serve in senior roles at CNG.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
As of Dec. 31, 2018, CGI's capital structure consists of about US$509 million in secured debt, and US$730 million in
unsecured debt on a consolidated basis. US$201 million of the consolidated unsecured debt is at the subsidiaries.

Analytical conclusions
CGI is highly strategic to CNG, which we assess to have high likelihood of receiving extraordinary government support
in case of financial distress. As a result, even though CGI's priority debt ratio is higher than our 50% threshold for
notching down the issue rating, we do not apply notching from the issuer credit rating. We believe the government is
willing and able to intervene so that structurally subordinated lenders would not have worse recovery prospects than
structurally senior lenders.
