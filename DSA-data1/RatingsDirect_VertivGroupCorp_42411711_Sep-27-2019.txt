Strong player in the data- and communication-center market.

Elevated leverage and risks associated with financial sponsor ownership.

The negative rating outlook reflects the company's elevated leverage profile.Vertiv Group Corp. has high leverage, with
an adjusted-debt-to-EBITDA ratio exceeding 9x on a trailing-12-months basis as of June 30, 2019. It was 7x on an
annualized basis of second-quarter earnings. Free cash flow is also weak, at negative $81 million for the 12 months
ended June 30, 2019, though it improved from negative $343 million at the same point last year.
We believe the company has good prospects to strengthen its credit measures over the next couple of years given its
operational improvements, which we expect to materialize more meaningfully; the rolloff of previously incurred costs
pertaining to the digital initiative; and the solid backlog that will support some credit metrics improvement. In our base
case, we expect Vertiv's leverage ratio to ease to the low-6x area over the next 12 months. The company could also
organically expand over 5% in 2019.
However, there is a 1-in-3 chance that the credit measures may not improve to that extent because of macro-related
uncertainties and the potential for unfavorable changes in product mix, market share, or operating costs.
Vertiv benefits from a strong market position in its markets. It has good global presence (revenues are split at roughly
45% from the U.S. and Canada and 55% from the rest of the world) and market positions. The company estimates that
it accounts for roughly 15% of the $20 billion global data center market. It is the second-largest player in the roughly
$8 billion power management space and has leading positions in large uninterruptible power supply, services and
consulting, thermal management, and software. However, it serves specialized markets and competes against much
larger, well-established companies that also maintain solid presence within Vertiv's markets.
We believe solid profitability is likely, reflecting the company's ongoing focus on reducing costs through operational
initiatives and maintaining a flexible cost structure. Vertiv's backlog of about $1.5 billion is healthy, and it has a diverse

customer base with strong retention characteristics. Its exposure to cyclical end markets and modest scale compared
to higher-rated peers partially offset the positive factors.

Outlook: Negative

Our negative outlook reflects the 1-in-3 potential that we may lower our ratings on Vertiv during the next year if it
does not improve credit ratios to more acceptable levels for the rating. An adjusted-debt-to-EBITDA ratio
remaining above 7x with unclear prospects for improvement could prompt a downgrade. This scenario could arise
if operational improvements are delayed or not fully realized, the cost environment remains challenging or
worsens, and with unfavorable shifts in product mix or market share. This could also happen if a sale of the
company increases leverage or delays the pace of improvement.

Upside scenario
We could revise the outlook to stable if Vertiv's growth and operational initiatives come to fruition and it becomes
apparent that its adjusted–debt-to-EBITDA ratio will remain below 7x. Profitable bookings from the company's
solid backlog, meaningful procurement savings, and gains from channel and digital investments could bring this
about.
While less likely, we could raise the rating on Vertiv if credit measures rapidly improve enough such that the
leverage ratio approaches 5.5x and we expect it to remain there. This more remote scenario could be due to a
successful IPO and if the proceeds, in addition to providing liquidity for shareholders, are also used to repay
substantial debt, including the $500 million of senior unsecured payment-in-kind (PIK) notes issued by the indirect
parent. An upgrade would also require strong evidence that the sponsor will pursue a less aggressive financial
policy.

Company Description
With trailing-12-months sales of about $4.4 billion as of June 30, 2019, Columbus, Ohio-based Vertiv primarily
manufactures power and thermal management equipment and provides services for data and communication centers.
It also makes products and software for commercial and industrial use.

Business Risk: Fair
Our view reflects its strong position in the niche data- and communication-center market, scale, long-standing
customer relationships, and low customer concentration (its top 10 account for about 20% of total sales). It is also
geographically well-diversified with operations across the Americas; Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and
APAC.
The ratings also take into consideration Vertiv's competition with large, well-capitalized companies including Eaton
Corp. PLC and Schneider Electric S.E. Additionally, its heavy concentration in the data- and communication-center
end markets exposes the company to cyclical fluctuations and potential shifts in customer demand.
We assess Vertiv's management and governance as fair. Management has specified financial and operational goals for
its restructuring and cost-reduction program and a strategic plan to support growth and profitability. However, we
score governance factors such as board effectiveness and management independence negative due to the company's
financial sponsor ownership and resulting lack of independence.

We included nVent Electric PLC because, like Vertiv, it supplies network power and thermal management products.
We included Evoqua Water Technologies Corp. because it is also a highly leveraged issuer in the capital goods
industry with the same rating.

Financial Risk: Highly leveraged
Our assessment of Vertiv contemplates its adjusted debt to EBITDA of about 6x-6.5x and funds from operations (FFO)
to adjusted debt of about 12% in the next 12 months.
Adjusted debt to EBITDA is elevated, driven by various costs related to restructuring, financing transactions, and
merger and acquisition activity, coupled with high debt. We expect the materialization of operational improvements,
improved backlog, improved EBITDA margins, and profitability should support the restoration of credit metrics to
more appropriate levels. These ratios assume Vertiv does not make large, debt-financed acquisitions beyond our
base-case forecasts while maintaining steady mid-single-digit percent expansion from ongoing growth investments and
bolt-on acquisitions.
Vertiv is owned by financial sponsor Platinum Equity. We expect credit metrics will continue to be highly leveraged,
consistent with aggressive financial policies of its owners. Our ratings incorporate modest acquisition activity and the
potential for financial policy events over time that are not more onerous than we expect.

Liquidity: Adequate
We assess Vertiv's liquidity as adequate. We expect the company's sources will be at least 1.2x its uses, and believe net
sources would remain positive even if EBITDA decreases by 15% from our projections.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• About $110 million cash as of June 30, 2019.

• Annual debt amortization of about $25 million.

• Availability of about $296 million under its $455
million asset-based loan (ABL) facility as of June 30,
2019.

• Working capital outflow of $80 million-$90 million in
2019.
• Maintenance capex of $45 million each year.

• FFO of about $220 million–$280 million annually for
next two years.

Requirements

We expect Vertiv to be in compliance with its

The ABL is subject to a springing minimum 1x

than the greater of 10% of the total commitments and
$30 million.

Issue Ratings - Recovery Analysis
Key analytical factors

Our simulated default scenario contemplates a default in 2022 due to a deep global recession that sharply reduces
sales volume. We assume pricing pressures exacerbate the distress and cause cash shortfalls that lead to a default.
