Overview
Key Strengths

Key Risks

Dominant position in China's offshore oil and gas industry.

Sensitive to the cyclicality of the oil and gas industry.

Increasingly diversified reserve base.

Significant capex will lower free operating cash flows.

Satisfactory reserve life and good production growth.
Credit metrics to remain robust on stable oil prices and strong cost control.
Extremely high likelihood of extraordinary support from China's central government.

Improving reserve life to provide higher visibility over increasing production growth. CNOOC Ltd.'s reserve life
improved to 10.5 years in 2018, from 8.7 years in 2015 because of higher oil prices and oil discoveries. All this led to
an enhanced reserve replacement ratio (RRR) of 126.0% in 2018, from 305.0% in 2017. With China's focus on national
energy security, we expect the company's increased exploration to further extend its reserve life, improving visibility
over increasing production growth.
Higher capex will result in lower free operating cash flows. The Chinese government has called for higher capital
expenditure (capex) in domestic exploration and production (E&P) to lift domestic oil and gas production for energy
security. We therefore expect CNOOC Ltd.'s capex to increase to Chinese renminbi (RMB) 80 billion in 2019, from
RMB63 billion in 2018, and remain high over the subsequent two years. Given that capex will take time to turn into
operating cash flows, we forecast the company's free operating cash flows to dip in 2019 and 2020.
Leverage profile to remain robust, despite a slight increase in the debt-to-EBITDA ratio. CNOOC Ltd.'s
debt-to-EBITDA ratio reduced to 0.5x in 2018 from 0.8x in 2017. This was mainly because of higher earnings and
strong free cash flows on the back of an increase in Brent oil prices. We expect the company's debt-to-EBITDA ratio to
increase slightly to 0.6x-0.7x in 2019-2021, due to likely lower Brent oil prices and higher capex.

Benefit from extraordinary government support will continue.We believe the likelihood of CNOOC Ltd. receiving
extraordinary government support remains extremely high, due to the importance of the oil and gas industry to China's
national security. In addition, the company plays a key role in ensuring a secure supply of energy to meet growing
domestic demand, given its dominant position in China's upstream oil and gas industry, especially offshore.
Sensitivity to inherent industry cyclicality remains. As a pure upstream player, CNOOC Ltd.'s profitability and cash
flows are subject to the inherent volatility in the oil and gas industry. We expect declining oil prices in 2019 and 2020
will lead to lower profit and cash flow. However, the company has sufficient rating buffer.

CNOOC Ltd.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on CNOOC Ltd. reflects the outlook on the sovereign credit rating on China. It also reflects our
expectation that the company will maintain its dominant position in China's offshore oil and gas E&P industry for
the next 12-24 months at least. Improving oil prices and CNOOC Ltd.'s stringent cost control have resulted in a
large buffer for the rating.

Downside scenario
We could downgrade CNOOC Ltd. if its parent CNOOC Group's debt-to-EBITDA ratio rises above 2.5x for a
sustained period. This could happen if oil prices drop significantly, CNOOC Ltd.'s operating expenses and capex
surge, or the company pursues large debt-funded acquisitions.
We could also lower the rating on CNOOC Ltd. if we downgrade China.

Upside scenario
We could raise the rating on CNOOC Ltd. if we upgrade China.

Our Base-Case Scenario

CNOOC Ltd.

Assumptions

• Brent oil prices to average US$60 per barrel (bbl) for
the rest of 2019 and 2020, and US$55 per bbl in
2021, down from US$71 per bbl in 2018. This is
based on slower demand growth and rising
production especially in the U.S. However,
continued OPEC production cuts and geopolitical
events could support oil prices.

• CNOOC Ltd.'s total oil and gas production to
increase by 2% to 485 million barrels of oil
equivalent (mmboe) in 2019 and 5% to 510 mmboe
in 2020, versus 1% growth in 2018. This is in
response to the government's call for higher
production. Our forecasts are mid-points of
management's targets.
• The company's revenue to decline by 7% in 2019
and then remain stable in 2020. The drop will be
primarily due to likely lower Brent oil prices.
Revenue grew by 22% in 2018 on higher oil prices.
• All-in cost to grow 4% annually in 2019-2020, given
limited scope for further cost cutting for material
and personnel.
• EBITDA margin to decline to 62.0%-64.0% in 2019
and 2020 from 64.8% in 2018, reflecting falling oil
prices.
• Annual capex to increase to RMB75 billion-RMB80
billion in 2019 and 2020.
• Annual working capital outflow of RMB3 billion in
2019 and RMB2 billion in 2020.
• Dividend pay-out to remain RMB23 billion-RMB24
billion per year for the next two years, the same as
in 2018.

Base-case projections
Capex will increase substantially. We expect CNOOC Ltd.'s annual capex to increase to RMB75.0 billion-RMB80.0
billion for the next two years, from RMB62.6 billion in 2018. That's following the government's call for higher domestic
E&P capex to lift domestic oil and gas production for energy security.

Production growth to continue despite likely lower oil prices. CNOOC Ltd. is the largest producer of offshore crude oil
and natural gas in China. The company's oil production remained stable in 2018 while gas production increased by
12% to 530 billion cubic feet (bcf). We expect oil production to increase about 2% in 2019 to 392 mmbbls, even though
we assume oil prices will fall. The increase reflects the Chinese government's request to raise domestic production.
Additionally, we expect gas production to grow 5.7% to 560 bcf in 2019, due to the government's promotion of natural
gas as a clean-burning fuel.
Management targets total oil and gas production of 480-490 mmboe in 2019, 505-515 mmboe in 2020, and 535-545
mmboe in 2021.
Adjusted EBITDA margins to decline in 2019 and 2020. We expect the company's adjusted EBITDA margin to
decrease to 62.0%-64.0% in 2019 and 2020, from 64.8% in 2018, to reflect likely lower oil prices. The decline in margin
will however be wider than that of other integrated peers, given that CNOOC Ltd. is a pure E&P company and very
sensitive to changes in oil prices.

Company Description
CNOOC Ltd., headquartered in Hong Kong, is the key operating subsidiary of China National Offshore Oil
Corp.(CNOOC Corp.). It mainly engages in E&P of crude oil and natural gas. It is the largest offshore upstream
producer in China. The company has operations across Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Oceania, and
Europe. As of Dec. 31, 2018, the company has net proved reserves of approximately 3.3 billion barrels of crude oil and
7.6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Chart 3

Business Risk: Strong
CNOOC Ltd.'s dominant position in China's offshore oil and gas industry, increasing and diversified reserve base,
satisfactory reserve life, and good exploration growth in China and overseas underpin its strong business position.
These benefits are tempered by the inherent cyclicality in the oil and gas industry, where performance is highly
dependent on crude oil prices.
The company has had a good track record over the past two to three years of exercising strong cost control in

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

response to low oil prices as well as increasing production. CNOOC Ltd. lowered its all-in cost for five consecutive
years such that the all-in cost in 2018 was 33% lower than that in 2013. This has enabled the company to remain
competitive among global peers.
Increasing E&P capex should enable CNOOC Ltd. to maintain its RRR at above 100%. This will, in turn, support the
company's oil and gas production targets for the next three years. CNOOC Ltd. has maintained its oil and gas reserve
life at about 10 years for the past decade. The company's RRR also stayed above 100% during this period. The only
exception is 2015 and 2016 when oil prices tanked that its RRR fell below 100% and its reserve life dropped to about
eight years.

CNOOC Ltd.

We have selected China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC) as a domestic peer, and Equinor ASA (formerly Statoil) and
Apache Corp. as CNOOC Ltd.'s international peers because they are E&P-focused companies.
CNOOC Ltd.'s business position is comparable to Equinor's and Apache's, with a similar reserve base and production
volumes. CNPC has a better business position due to its much larger reserve base of 20.4 billion boe, as against 1
billion-6 billion boe for the other peers.
CNOOC Ltd.'s financial metrics are better than CNPC's and Apache's, and are at par with Equinor's, due to the
company's very stringent control both in terms of capex and operating expenses.
The ratings on CNOOC Ltd. and Equinor benefit from one notch uplift from extraordinary government support.
However, we see the likelihood of support to be extremely high for CNOOC Ltd. and moderately high for Equinor.
That is due to the importance of oil and gas to fuel China's economic growth and the country's rising reliance on oil
and gas imports, which reached 70% and 40% in 2018 respectively. The rating on CNPC' is constrained by the
sovereign rating on China. Apache does not have such benefit because we do not see it as a government-related entity.

Financial Risk: Modest
We believe CNOOC Ltd.'s credit metrics will remain robust on account of a strong balance sheet and significant cash
balance. That's despite a slight increase in the debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 0.6x-0.7x over the next two to three years,
from 0.5x in 2019.
The company's adjusted debt reduced substantially to about RMB72 billion in 2018, from RMB100 billion in 2017, due
to its strong and increased cash flows on the back of lower-than-budgeted capex and higher oil prices. We forecast the
debt to increase to RMB77 billion-RMB79 billion in 2019 and 2020, given likely lower oil prices and higher capex will
lead to negative discretionary cash flows.
Due to the inherent volatility of the oil and gas industry and CNOOC Ltd.'s exposure to pure E&P, we have applied one
notch volatility adjustment in our assessment of the company's financial risk profile.

Liquidity: Strong
We assess CNOOC Ltd.'s liquidity as strong as the company's liquidity sources will cover liquidity uses by about 2.1x
in the next 24 months ending June 30, 2021. Net liquidity sources will remain positive even if EBITDA declines by
30%.
CNOOC Ltd. has good relationships with banks and a good standing in the capital markets given it is a central
state-owned enterprise in a strategic industry. As of June 30, 2019, the company has unutilized banking facilities of
RMB50.7 billion, and this balance has been stable in the past three years.
In addition, the company had RMB170 billion cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2019. Therefore, we believe it
has a strong ability to absorb high-impact, low-probability events.
CNOOC Ltd. has prudent risk management. The company had been in net cash position since its listing in 2001 until it
acquired Nexen Inc. in 2013. Even after that, CNOOC Ltd.'s has been low, especially for an oil and gas E&P company.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

We consider environmental factors to be key for CNOOC Ltd. as an oil and gas company. As one of the three
national oil companies of China, CNOOC Ltd. has to meet environmental protection targets set by the government.
CNOOC Ltd. considers environmental, social, and governance factors to be high priority for its operations. All new
projects have to go through environmental and social impact assessments. The company invested RMB350 million
(about US$52 million) in emission reduction projects in 2017. Emissions of major pollutants all fell in 2017 from a
year earlier.
CNOOC Ltd. has experienced no major environmental issues in the past five years. The last major oil spill
happened at its Penglai 19-3 oilfield in Bohai Bay in June 2011. ConocoPhillips (COP) was the operator of the field,
and the reason for the oil spill was that COP violated the overall development plan. However, CNOOC Ltd. paid
RMB480 million (about US$74 million) for the protection of Bohai Bay.
CNOOC Ltd. is also involved in the offshore wind power industry. It began work on a project in Jiangsu Province
in January 2019. However, we believe this initiative is still in the early stages and its impact on the company's
creditworthiness will be limited in the next three to five years.

Government Influence
We see an extremely high likelihood that CNOOC Ltd. would receive timely and sufficient extraordinary government
support if it comes under financial stress. Therefore, the rating on CNOOC Ltd. incorporates one notch of uplift over
the company's stand-alone credit profile of 'a'. Our assessment of extraordinary government support is based on the
following CNOOC Ltd. characteristics:
• Critical role to the government. CNOOC Ltd. is the dominant oil and gas E&P player in offshore China. It plays a
key role in helping the government ensure a secured supply of energy to meet growing domestic demand.
• Very strong link to the government. The Chinese government indirectly owns about 64.44% of the company,
through CNOOC. In our view, the government is able to exert a strong influence on CNOOC Ltd.'s strategy through
the appointment of board members and senior management.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
As of Dec. 31, 2018, CNOOC Ltd.'s capital structure consists of about RMB139.5 billion of senior unsecured debt that
the company issued or guaranteed.

Analytical conclusions
We rate the senior unsecured debt that CNOOC Ltd. issued or guarantees 'A+', which is the same as our long-term
issuer credit rating on the company. This reflects our view that the company's capital structure does not have material
subordination risk because its priority debt does not exceed our threshold of 50% of consolidated total debt. This is
because CNOOC Ltd. tends to issue debt using special purpose vehicles that it guarantees.
Also, with CNOOC Ltd.'s extremely high likelihood of extraordinary government support, we believe the government
is willing and able to intervene so that structurally subordinated lenders do not have poorer recovery prospects than
structurally senior lenders in case of financial distress.
