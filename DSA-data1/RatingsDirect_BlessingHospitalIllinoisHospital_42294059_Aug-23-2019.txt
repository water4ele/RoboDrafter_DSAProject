Rationale
S&P Global Ratings assigned its 'A' issuer credit rating (ICR) to Blessing Hospital (Blessing), Ill. The outlook is stable.
The rating reflects our view of Blessing's consistently robust operating performance, supported in recent years by
growing inpatient utilization trends, as well as healthy maximum annual debt service (MADS) coverage and a balance
sheet highlighted by solid unrestricted reserves and moderate debt. Blessing has maintained a leading market position
for many years, as the hospital is embedded in the community and sees outmigration primarily for services not
provided in the primary service area (PSA). Blessing has also made strides in strengthening its physician base with
increased recruitment and the acquisition of the Hannibal Clinic in the past year. Blessing took out $45 million in new
privately held debt in fiscal 2019, the majority of which will fund capital expansion and improvements to the Moorman
Pavilion on its main campus. We expect Blessing to maintain solid operating results throughout a period of heightened
capital spending.
On March 5, 2019, a local independent physician group, Quincy Medical Group (QMG), was granted a certificate of
need for an ambulatory surgical center (ASC) in Quincy, which could negatively affect volumes and operations at
Blessing once open. In response, Blessing will be moving its ASC to the main campus and is recruiting specialty
physicians to lessen its reliance on QMG and capture a portion of services that have historically migrated outside of
the service area. QMG's ASC will take an estimated 18-24 months to open and Blessing has a plan to cut expenses to
address the increased competitive pressure. In our view, the QMG ASC could materially affect Blessing's market
position and the rating includes a negative holistic adjustment on Blessing that primarily reflects the uncertainty of the
effects on the enterprise and financial profile once QMG's ASC is operational.
The 'A' rating further reflects our view of Blessing's:
• Consistently robust operating margins well above medians for the rating level, contributing to solid MADS
coverage;
• Leading and incrementally growing market share in its PSA; and
• Healthy balance sheet, with slightly declining unrestricted reserves due to capital spending, but still in line with the
rating level.
Partly offsetting the above strengths, in our view, are Blessing's:
• Location in a more limited rural service area but with a fairly stable economy;
• Reliance on an independent physician group for a majority of hospital admissions; and

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

AUGUST 22, 2019 2

Blessing Hospital, Illinois; Hospital

• Moderately aggressive debt structure, with almost all debt privately held, although overall debt levels are in line
with rating medians.

Outlook
The stable outlook reflects our expectation of Blessing's continued solid operations, leading business position, and
MADS coverage in excess of medians for the rating level. Management continues to invest in its facility, physicians,
and secondary market, as well as population health initiatives, which adds further stability to the rating.

Upside scenario
We believe that the 'A' rating is suitable for the hospital and a higher rating is unlikely within the two-year outlook
period given the potential increased competition and heightened capital spending. However, we could consider raising
the rating over time if Blessing is able to significantly improve its balance sheet such that metrics are above the 'A'
rating level and if the hospital's business position continues to improve.

Downside scenario
We could lower the rating if unrestricted reserves decline such that metrics are no longer appropriate for the rating.
We could also consider a negative outlook or rating action if operations decline such that operating margin and MADS
coverage are no longer in line with the rating level. Finally, we would consider a negative rating action if Blessing's
market position declines or if market share decreases significantly.

Enterprise Profile: Strong
Modest, stable PSA with limited growth projected
Blessing Hospital is in Quincy, Ill., the main retail and industrial city in Adams County and for the wider area. The
service area is on the western edge of Illinois, south of the Iowa border and north of the St. Louis area. Overall
population in the PSA is stable with 166,000 people, and some limited population and employment growth is
projected, although less than for the U.S. as a whole. In addition, per capita income is in line with the national average.
The region has many employers and does not depend on any particular one. The economy is based largely on
manufacturing and, as the seat of Adams County and the largest community in the area, Quincy is the retail and
service hub for a 60-mile radius, with an unemployment rate that is lower than that of the state. The population is
slightly older and the overall payer mix includes a slightly high governmental payer exposure, with about 34% of net
revenue from Medicare and 10% from Medicaid as of June 30, 2019.

Leading market position with increased physician focus
Blessing (together with Illini Community Hospital) holds the leading business position in its PSA, with a 61.1% market
share, followed by Hannibal Regional Hospital in Missouri, which captures about 15% of the market. Quincy and
Adams County's regional population of 67,000 compared with the PSA population of 166,000 reflects Blessing's broad
draw as a regional provider in a largely rural area. Tertiary and quaternary patients that Blessing cannot accommodate
typically outmigrate to St. Louis or Columbia. To better serve its community, Blessing continues to expand services,
with much recent focus on behavioral health and local retail operations. One of the hospital's larger competitors is

AUGUST 22, 2019 3

Blessing Hospital, Illinois; Hospital

Unity Point Health, which operates outside of Blessing's service area and has been exiting the Quincy market over the
past several years. In June 2019, Unity Point and Sanford Health announced their intent to merge. While the potential
merger would operate a large integrated health system near Blessing, Sanford Health operates primarily in Iowa, North
and South Dakota, and Montana. While there is no movement into the Quincy area at this time, we will continue to
monitor the possible changes to the competitive landscape as they relate to Blessing.
Blessing employs 72 physicians, who account for 37.5% of total inpatient admissions as of June 30, 2019. The largest
independent physician group in the service area is QMG, with over 100 physician members, accounting for about 50%
of Blessing's revenue. Although Unity Point Health owns a minority interest in QMG, management reports no
significant changes in how QMG directs and manages its patients in the service area.
The greater service area and industry have experienced a declining inpatient admission trend during the past few
years, but Blessing has seen some growth as a result of increased physician recruitment and replacement, as well as a
focus on key service lines and partnerships with providers in the region. Management is projecting modest growth in
inpatient and outpatient volumes given the industry trends.

Stable management team with no changes expected
Blessing's management team has been stable and is implementing strategies to maintain its organizational strength.
Management continues to review and analyze the large competitive landscape, as well as how health care reform and
reimbursement trends might affect the organization. To that end, it has focused on expense controls and on investing
in its physician base, and has historically focused on care-coordination strategies that continue to evolve. Blessing
joined the BJC Collaborative to help the organization explore and benefit from population health initiatives and
quality-based programs. Management has also effectively strengthened its balance sheet during the past few years to
maintain some flexibility for challenges that may arise from reimbursement and from the shifts in the broader industry,
and to accommodate capital investment.

Financial Profile: Strong
Consistently healthy operating performance
Operating performance remained healthy in fiscal 2018, primarily because of ongoing successful expense management
and increased volumes. Net patient revenue grew to $554 million in 2018, from $453 million in 2017. Excluding
investment income, joint-venture income, and unrestricted contributions, Blessing generated a robust $49.4 million in
operating income (8.9% margin) in 2018. Through the third quarter interim ended June 30, 2019, operating income
was a solid, but lighter $27.6 million (6.43% margin). Management is budgeting for a 5.5% operating margin in fiscal
2019 due to projected flat patient volumes, although management typically budgets conservatively and we expect
Blessing to meet or exceed budget.
With the continued solid operations and healthy investment returns, Blessing's excess income totaled $57.9 million
(10.3% margin) in 2018, contributing to robust MADS coverage of 9.23x based on MADS of $9 million. We anticipate
that MADS coverage will improve as debt service decreases during the next several years.

Slight deterioration in liquidity projected due to heightened capital spending
Liquidity and financial flexibility remain sound, although capital spending in the past year and future plans will
decrease unrestricted reserves. Although deterioration is projected, we expect Blessing's liquidity position to remain
sufficient for the rating level. On a pro forma basis, with the expectation of the paydown of existing debt, unrestricted
reserves as of June 30, 2019 totaled $288 million, down from $314 million in fiscal 2018. Pro forma days' cash on hand
is 208 days and unrestricted reserves-to-long-term debt was 180% as of June 30, 2019, which is softer than in previous
years but still sufficient for the rating level and expected to improve over the outlook period.
Blessing is budgeting about $82 million in capital spending in fiscal 2019, which will be funded partially by debt and
the rest from operating cash and unrestricted reserves. The majority of the plans include expansion of the main
campus, a medical office building on the eastern side of Quincy, and moving its ASC to the main hospital campus.
While the capital spending is much higher than in previous years, we believe the updates will benefit the facilities and
Blessing's strong operations should support the heightened spending.

Debt and contingent liability profile
Overall leverage and debt-related metrics are modest and well within rating medians. Pro forma leverage, assuming
total long-term debt of $160 million, is solid at 24% as of June 30, 2019. Blessing has no publicly rated debt, with its
entire debt portfolio consisting of privately held bank debt. While we view this structure as more aggressive, we
consider Blessing's overall debt profile to be manageable and offset by a healthy unrestricted

Blessing Hospital, Illinois; Hospital

reserves-to-long-term-debt ratio. As of January 2017, Blessing froze its pension plan to new benefit accruals. The net
pension liability in fiscal 2018 was $35 million, or about 79% funded, up from a funding level of 69% in fiscal 2017,
which we view favorably.
