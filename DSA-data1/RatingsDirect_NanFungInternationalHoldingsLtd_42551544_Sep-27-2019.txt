Overview
Key strengths

Key risks

Growing rental income from China and Hong Kong.

High project concentration resulting in more volatile and "lumpy"
revenue and leverage.

Liquid balance sheet with significant cash holdings and investments in
marketable securities.

Smaller business scale compared with peers in Hong Kong and
mainland China.

Long operating record in the property sector, and good financial
management.

Occasional debt-financed acquisitions, although partly mitigated by
active financial control.

Good financial flexibility for ongoing capital expenditure and potential debt-funded acquisitions. We believe Nan Fung
International Holdings Ltd. will remain prudent in financial management. Its leverage (measured by the ratio of debt to
EBITDA) will likely only rise moderately over the next two to three years, to 4.0x-5.0x. Nan Fung's leverage improved
to 3.2x in fiscal 2019 (year ended March 31) after spiking to 8.3x in 2018 when the company acquired its Kai Tak
project. The reduction in leverage was primarily due to Nan Fung's well-controlled debt and satisfactory
revenue-booking from project delivery. We believe the company has sufficient headroom for ongoing spending on
existing projects and potential acquisitions. We expect it to have capital expenditure (capex) of Hong Kong dollar
(HK$) 7 billion–HK$8 billion in total for the next three years for its project at Kai Tak in Hong Kong. Nan Fung may
also make debt-funded acquisitions of land parcels or property projects in Greater China or overseas.
Sustainable rental income and liquid balance sheet support credit profile. Nan Fung's growing and sustainable income
from investment properties provides strong support to its credit profile and tempers the impact of volatile cash flows
from property development, in our view. We also anticipate the company's recurring income, which majorly consists
of rental income from Hong Kong and mainland China, will continue to grow by 10%-15% annually. Furthermore, the
company's sizable financial investment portfolio provides a substantial additional financial buffer.

High project concentration and moderate business scale constrain rating upside Nan Fung's credit standing is
constrained by its midsize business scale compared with Hong Kong and mainland China's peers with similar ratings. A
significant portion of Nan Fung's contracted sales in the next two years will likely come from a few projects in Hong
Kong and Macau. These weaknesses are partly offset by the company's diverse revenue streams, growing rental
income, and long operating record. We estimate the Kai Tak project, upon completion in 2022, will generate additional
rental income of HK$1 billion-HK$1.2 billion per year, on top of Nan Fung's current rental income of HK$1.5
billion–HK$1.6 billion.

SEPTEMBER 27, 2019 3

Nan Fung International Holdings Ltd.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our view that Nan Fung's leverage will stay in a narrow range commensurate with the
rating over the next 12-24 months. This is despite the company's significant capital investment for its Kai Tak
project.
We expect Nan Fung to control its risk appetite and pace of expansion. In addition, we anticipate that the company
will maintain its large investment portfolio, providing it with substantial additional financial flexibility.

Downside scenario
We may lower the rating if:
• Nan Fung's EBITDA interest coverage falls to below 2.5x without signs of improvement. This could happen if
the company's debt-funded expansion is more aggressive than we expect without asset sales; or
• The market value of the company's investment portfolio declines materially.

Upside scenario
We see limited rating upside in the next 12-18 months due to Nan Fung's increasing leverage for its continued
capex for existing projects. Nevertheless, we may raise the rating if the company materially improves its financial
leverage such that its debt-to-EBITDA ratio stays below 4x while EBITDA interest coverage stays above 3x on a
sustainable basis.

Our Base-Case Scenario

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 27, 2019 4

Nan Fung International Holdings Ltd.

Assumptions

• Nan Fung's total contracted sales, including
attributable revenue from joint ventures (JVs), will
largely depend on its own project schedule due to its
limited number of projects. We forecast the
company's sales to be HK$9 billion–HK$10 billion in
fiscal 2020. Total revenue will then fluctuate
between HK$8 billion and HK$14 billion in fiscals
2021 and 2022 to reflect the likely fewer pre-sold
projects completed and delivered during the years.

• Nan Fung's annual gross rental income, hotel
revenue, property management fee income, and
construction revenue to be HK$3.3 billion-HK$3.5
billion in the next two years.
• Its total spending for capex to be about HK$2.5
billion in fiscal 2020, increasing to HK$4 billion in
fiscal 2021, mainly driven by the Kai Tak project.
• The company's spending on land for fiscal 2020 to
be about HK$3.5 billion, increasing to HK$6
billion–HK$12 billion in fiscals 2021-2022 for land in
Greater China and overseas.

Base-case projections
EBITDA margin will improve moderately despite volatile revenues. We expect Nan Fung's EBITDA margin, including
contribution from JVs, to moderately improve to, and sustain at, about 40% over the next two years. This is due to
recognition of higher-margin projects such as the No. 8 Deep Water Bay Drive sold previously. Revenue will remain
lumpy given project concentration and uneven launch schedule.

Company Description
Nan Fung is a privately held company that is part of the Nan Fung Group. The company is engaged in property
investment and development in Hong Kong, China, and internationally. It also has hotel operations, and investment
holding and trading businesses. Nan Fung has about 60 years of history in property development. It is a key subsidiary
of Chen's Group International Ltd., which is wholly owned by Dr. Chen Din Hwa's Estates.

Business Risk: Fair
We expect Nan Fung's revenue to decline significantly in fiscal 2020, primarily due to lower revenue recognition of
projects presold. This drop highlights the company's project concentration and lumpiness of income. Nan Fung's fair
mix of high-end and mass-market projects for sale should provide some buffer against the volatile property market in
Hong Kong. We anticipate revenue will rebound moderately in fiscal 2021 due to recognition of previously sold
projects such as Lohas Park 6.
Nan Fung's profitability should improve in fiscal 2020 and be in line with the market average in Hong Kong, and better
than that of peers in mainland China. This is because of revenue booking for higher-margin projects such as the 8 Deep
Water Bay Drive. We believe the company's gross margin from the property development will increase to above 40%
in fiscal 2020. This compares with about 19% gross margin from property sales in fiscal 2019, when lower-margin
projects were completed and delivered.

Nan Fung International Holdings Ltd.

Nan Fung's growing and sustainable rental income from its high-quality investment properties temper the volatility in
the property development business. We expect the company to continue to enhance its recurring income from
investment properties and gradually reduce reliance on revenue from property development. This is despite
macroeconomic headwinds in Hong Kong and Nan Fung's potential debt-funded acquisitions of land pieces or projects
in the next two to three years. Meanwhile, the quality of Nan Fung's earning will be significantly boosted by the Kai
Tak project.

Nan Fung International Holdings Ltd.--Peer Comparison (cont.)
HK$--Hong Kong dollar.

Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. (SHKP) and CK Asset Holdings Ltd. (CKAH) are two close peers of Nan Fung in Hong
Kong. All these companies have a presence in Hong Kong and China, and have a significant portion of rental income
from high-quality investment portfolios.
Nan Fung has a smaller operating scale than its peers, mainly due to its weaker presence in China and smaller portfolio
of investment properties. Nan Fung's credit metrics are also weaker than the peers'. However, the company has a
liquid balance sheet with a high cash balance and substantial amount of financial investments.
We consider China Jinmao Holdings Group Ltd. (Jinmao) and Longfor Group Holdings Ltd. as two close peers of Nan
Fung in mainland China. All three companies have similar focus on residential and commercial property development.
They also have a sizable investment property portfolio.
Jinmao has the highest margin due to premium pricing of its property products and contributions from high-margin
segments. Longfor has the largest rental income and investment-property portfolio. But Longfor's rental income is not
able to fully cover its gross interest expenses due to its high debt owing to its rapidly growing property development
business.
Nan Fung and Jinmao's credit metrics are weaker than those of the Hong Kong peers. Jinmao benefits from group
support from its state-owned parent, Sinochem Group, while Nan Fung benefits from its liquid balance sheet and good
quality investment property portfolio.

Financial Risk: Aggressive
Nan Fung's recurring cash flows from good quality investment properties, sound record of financial control, and large
portfolio of financial securities support its financial strength. These factors mitigate risks associated with opportunistic
acquisitive expansion, volatility in revenue and margin, and ongoing capex for the Kai Tak project.
In assessing the financial leverage of Nan Fung, we include only property-related income in our credit metrics. We
proportionally consolidate the financial details of JVs and associates in our analysis. Given Nan Fung's high proportion
of property sales and contributions from JVs and associates, we believe this method most appropriately reflects the
company's financial position.
We anticipate Nan Fung's capex will moderate over the next three years, mainly driven by spending on the Kai Tak
project. The company's deleveraging in fiscal 2019 was largely due to active debt reduction and good control over
spending for land and other acquisitions. This follows the HK$24.6 billion debt-financed land acquisition of the Kai Tak
project in fiscal 2018.
Nan Fung's growing rental income will continue to provide additional cash flow resilience. We forecast that the
company will continue to sustain its ratio of rental income to interest expenses at 1.3x-1.4x over the next two fiscal
years, supported by growing rental income and lower funding costs.
Nan Fung's large financial investments provide substantial additional financial flexibility. As of March 31, 2019, the
value of total investments is HK$21.5 billion, and includes listed securities (HK$10.3 billion), funds, and private equity.
Most of the listed securities are "blue-chip" stocks or average-quality bonds, which we assess as having fair liquidity
and diversity. Nan Fung's leverage would substantially improve if the company monetizes the listed securities for debt
repayment. We reflect the high level of financial flexibility in our assessment of Nan Fung's capital structure.
In our view, Nan Fung's large cash balance could support its expansion plans and project development. We believe the
company will maintain conservative financial management and prudence in its securities portfolio, which is unlevered.

Liquidity: Strong
We assess Nan Fung's liquidity as strong, thanks to the company's large committed undrawn lines and strong cash
flows. We expect Nan Fung's ratio of liquidity sources to liquidity uses to be about 1.6x for the 24 months ending
March 31, 2021. We expect liquidity sources to exceed uses even if EBITDA declines by 50%. In our view, Nan Fung
has solid relationships with banks and has good access to capital markets.

Covenant Analysis
Nan Fung has several leverage and net worth covenants in its banking facilities. As of March 31, 2019, the company
has complied with its financial covenants as in the past. We expect Nan Fung to have a sufficient buffer to meet its
covenants over the next 12 months.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
As of March 31, 2019, Nan Fung's capital structure consists of HK$12 billion in secured debt, mostly in the form of
secured bank borrowings, and HK$21.2 billion in unsecured debt. Of the unsecured debt, HK$3.5 billion is at the
subsidiary level. The ratio of secured debt and unsecured debt at subsidiaries to consolidated total debt is 42%, below
our 50% threshold to notch down the issue rating.

Analytical conclusions
Nan Fung's debt is rated 'BBB-', the same as the issuer credit rating. This is because we do not consider there to be
significant elements of subordination risk in the company's capital structure. We believe Nan Fung will maintain a
stable level of priority debt.
