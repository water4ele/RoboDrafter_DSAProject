Key Risks

Largest North American equipment rental provider with a national branch
footprint.

Exposed to highly cyclical nonresidential construction and
industrial spending.

Significant scale provides strong bargaining power over suppliers and
vendors.

High capital expenditure forecast at about 14% to 16% of revenues
per year.

Diversified customer base and product range help somewhat reduce
performance volatility.

Execution risks related to recent large acquisitions.

Track record of maintaining leverage within its target levels, despite sizable
share repurchases.

Credit measures subject to volatility during periods of stress.

Several factors should enable United Rentals Inc. (URI) to build on its leading market share. S&P Global Ratings
expects the rental equipment industry to remain generally favorable over the next 12-24 months as modest economic
expansion and historical underinvestment in infrastructure support continued spending in industrial and nonresidential
construction sectors. We also expect the benefits of renting the equipment, such as having the right equipment for
varying projects, capital conservation, and no need for equipment maintenance, to outweigh the costs of ownership for
customers, especially for large national or multiregional projects.

We expect URI's credit metrics to improve in fiscal 2019 despite increasing share repurchases. URI's financial policy has
moderated in 2019 to allow for the integration of BlueLine and BakerCorp in 2018 and to better position the company
for any potential economic slowdown. Specifically, earlier in 2019 URI tightened its target net debt-to-EBITDA ratio by
half a turn to the 2x-3x range over the cycle and has a track record of maintaining leverage within its target range. We
expect no large acquisitions over the next 12 months and believe the company will direct the majority of its free
operating cash flow (FOCF) towards shareholder returns. We expect adjusted leverage to approach mid-2x by fiscal
year-end 2019 as the company grows EBITDA by a high-teen percentage and maintains sufficiently large cash
balances.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our expectation for solid demand growth, improving equipment rental pricing, and
steady utilization, and for the company to continue to focus on cost and capital management. This should enable
URI to improve its leverage to the mid-2x area over the next 12 months, which provides a cushion of about 1x to
absorb the potential volatility in its EBITDA over the economic cycle and the high degree of capital intensity in its
industry. We also expect the company to continue to make financial policy decisions--particularly those related to
share repurchases and future acquisitions--that enable it to sustain this level of leverage over the next 12 months.

Downside scenario
We could lower the rating if we expect the company to experience a significant decline in end-market demand,
while sustaining high levels of capital investment that results in leverage increasing and sustaining above 3x. We
could also lower the rating if the company completes significant share repurchases or debt-funded acquisitions that
result in the same level of leverage.

Upside scenario
Although unlikely over the next 12 months, we could raise our rating if we expect the company's debt to EBITDA
to improve to below 2x in an upcycle while balancing capital investments with cash flow generation. Under this
scenario, we would also need to be confident that the company's financial policies were aligned with this level of
leverage.

Our Base-Case Scenario
Assumptions

• Long-term demand trends for the equipment rental
industry in North America are generally positive due
to relatively lower rental penetration rates in the
U.S. compared to other developed markets. The
economics of renting continue to compare favorably
to those of owning as renting allows customers to
adjust their fleet to match cyclical end-market
demand. We expect the equipment rental industry to
experience stable profitability in 2019, as the supply
and demand of equipment remain balanced and
rental rates remain steady or modestly improve.

Key Metrics

Based on these assumptions, we arrive at the following
credit measures:
• Debt to EBITDA in the mid-2x area through 2020.
• FOCF to debt in the 12%-17% range through 2020.
• Funds from operations (FFO) to debt in the
30%-35% range through 2020.

• U.S. GDP growth of 2.5% in 2019 and 1.8% in 2020.
• Nonresidential structures investment declines by
1.4% in 2019 and grows by 1.9% in 2020.
• We expect URI's revenue to increase in the
mid-teens percentage area in 2019 and in the low- to
mid-single-digit percentage range in 2020. We
expect revenue growth to exceed GDP and
nonresidential construction growth (particularly in
2019) via improved pricing and sustained equipment
utilization, as well as benefits from its recent
acquisitions.
• URI continues to generate adjusted EBITDA
margins in the 50% area through 2020, supported by
the company's economies of scale and continued
realization of cost efficiencies.
• The company will make net capital expenditures
(capex) of about $1.4 billion-$1.5 billion in 2019,
which we expect will moderate slightly in 2020.
• The company will maintain a balanced approach to
internal investment, acquisitions, and share
repurchases.

Base-case projections
Improving operating results and better working capital management should generate solid levels of free operating cash
flow in 2019. Our forecast includes modest EBITDA margin expansion in 2019 of about 100 basis points as the
company reinvests most productivity gains and cost savings into the business and achieves (although with delays)
acquisition integration benefits. We also believe URI can leverage its scale and improving sales performance to

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

AUGUST 19, 2019 5

United Rentals Inc.

achieve payment agreements with its suppliers that are more advantageous. These drivers should result in in annual
cash flow generation of about $1.5 billion in 2019 and in excess of $1.8 billion in 2020. Our view of the company's free
operating cash flow generation is supported by the assumption that the company's relatively young equipment fleet,
with average age of about four years, will allow URI to cut back on its capital spending and generate sustained levels of
FOCF in an industry downturn.
Downside risks to our forecast include a slowing U.S. economy, greater competition, and delayed integration of
acquisitions that closed in 2018. The rental equipment industry has benefited in recent years from strong economic
growth in the U.S. and healthy nonresidential and industrial construction activity. However, we believe the near-term
risk of increased global trade tensions is casting a shadow on the U.S. economy and financial market conditions. URI
should be able to maintain its gross and EBITDA margins due to its strong relationships with suppliers and because we
expect it will sustain its fleet utilization rates (particularly with key national and regional accounts) due to its strong
geographic reach. However, long-term risks around volumes remain if competition intensifies and global economic
conditions weigh on capital investment decisions of large U.S. corporate customers.

Company Description
With more than $8 billion of revenues and about 13% North American market share, URI is the largest equipment
rental company in the world, operating primarily in the U.S. and Canada. The company's core equipment rental
revenues represent about 86% of overall revenues. URI also generates revenues from sales of new and used
equipment, supplies, and other services.

Business Risk: Fair
URI maintains its no. 1 market position as the largest equipment rental company in the U.S., with over $9 billion of
total revenue forecasted for 2019. The company operates in the highly competitive and fragmented equipment rental
industry and is exposed to highly cyclical end-markets (such as construction, industrial, and infrastructure), which we
believe can limit customer stickiness and pricing power. Still, we believe URI's scale and broad range of products and
services gives it some ability to match cyclical end-market demand, as well as enhance its purchasing power with
suppliers. We expect the company to continue to be a consolidator within its industry, as evidenced by its 2018
acquisitions of BlueLine and BakerCorp, which comes with some integration risk. Still, we expect URI to manage the
integration of any future acquisitions so that it maintains its strong adjusted EBITDA margins of around 50%, which we
view as above average compared to equipment rental peers.

We compare URI to the following peers in the equipment rental industry:

Ashtead Group is a U.K based equipment rental company catering to customers operating primarily across the
industrial and construction end-markets. The company operates through its Sunbelt Rentals subsidiary in the U.S.
market, and is the second largest equipment rental company in the U.S. Despite similar EBITDA margins, Ashtead's
higher rating is supported by a more conservative balance sheet, with debt leverage of slightly below 2x.
H&E Equipment Services (HEES) provides integrated equipment services in the U.S., including equipment rentals, new
equipment sales, used equipment sales, parts sales, and repair and maintenance services, with a focus on heavy

construction and industrial equipment. URI generates a higher proportion of revenues from the high margin rental
business and maintains a better margin profile.
HERC Holdings Inc. is the third largest North American equipment rental provider in the fragmented equipment rental
industry. URI has a larger scale, stronger margin profile, and lower debt leverage than HERC.

Financial Risk: Significant
URI maintains good credit measures, characterized by an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.9x and FFO-to-debt ratio
of slightly over 30% for the 12 months ended June 30, 2019. The company generates solid free operating cash flow,
which should reach about $1.5 billion in 2019 and yield a free-cash-flow-to-debt ratio of 14%. We believe this level of
cash flow generation provides management with capacity to prudently pursue bolt-on acquisitions and shareholder
rewards while maintaining leverage in line with our expectations for the rating.
Over the cycle, we expect URI to manage capital spending in a manner that allows it to generate consistently positive
FOCF even while it invests in its fleet. Still, cash flows for equipment rental companies can behave in countercyclical
manner. We expect that, in favorable market conditions, URI will generate strong profits but its FOCF to debt ratio can
weaken because of the capital spending required to support growth. Conversely, we expect the company would curtail
capex and sell equipment to reduce debt as an offset to lower earnings in cyclical downturns.

Liquidity: Adequate
We believe URI has adequate liquidity over the next 12 months, supported by ample availability under its $3.75 billion
asset-based lending (ABL) facility, strong FFO, and modest cash balances. We expect these sources of liquidity to
exceed liquidity uses by about 2.2x and for net sources to remain positive in the event forecasted EBITDA declines by
15%. We believe the company has a satisfactory standing in the credit markets, as demonstrated by its recent debt
issuances at favorable rates, and has an ability to absorb material adverse market events with limited needs to
refinance given its ABL capacity, good internal cash flow generation, and limited debt maturities over the next 12
months. Additionally, we believe the company exhibits relatively prudent risk management, as evidenced by the
reduction in the company's capex during periods of weaker end-market demand.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Cash balances of about $75 million as of June 30,
2019;

• About $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion of net capex over
the next 12 months, which include maintenance and
committed capital spending;

• About $2 billion available under its ABL facility as of
June 30, 2019; and
• Our expectation for FFO of about $3.3 billion over
the next 12 months.

• $945 million balance of the accounts receivable
securitization facility expiring 2020;
• Modest working capital outflows;
• About $10 million of annual debt amortization
payments.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

We view URI's exposure to environmental risk to be minimal. In our opinion, the most significant environmental
risk is the disposal of the engine oil and harsh chemicals used to maintain its fleet. The company utilizes
water-recycling systems in its wash bays and its water withdrawals are not made from sensitive water sources.
Regarding emissions, fuel-efficiency, and other environmental standards, URI's exposure is much lower compared
with equipment manufacturers given the focus on rental rather than manufacturing. Should one of the company's
suppliers fail to comply with environmental regulations, we anticipate URI's liability to any subsequent fines or
regulatory action would be minimal.
We believe URI curates a fleet of equipment from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and therefore has
some control over the sustainability of its fleet by choosing equipment that meets its broader environmental goals.
On the social front, URI is primarily exposed to risks associated with occupational safety. The company has
instituted policies that reinforce workplace safety, including daily safety trainings and on-site safety managers at
each branch. These efforts resulted in a 7% reduction in the company's total recordable incident rate between 2016
and 2017.

Issue Ratings - Recovery Analysis
Key analytical factors
• Our simulated default scenario contemplates an unexpected and drastic downturn in the nonresidential construction
industry that severely strains the company's equipment usage, rental rates, revenue, and cash flow.
• Although we believe URI would likely reorganize after a default, we use a discrete asset value (DAV) approach to
analyze recovery prospects for most general equipment rental providers. We believe this method provides a
conservative estimate of the likely value available to creditors, although realization rates could be lower than we
assume if a large quantity of equipment floods the market.
• Our DAV starts with the net book value of the company's assets as of June 30, 2019. We assume balance sheet
accounts are partially diluted to reflect the assumed loss of appraised value through additional depreciation or
expected contraction in working capital assets in the period leading up to the hypothetical default. We then apply
realization rates to the assets, reflecting the friction of selling or the discounts potential buyers or restructurers
would apply in distressed circumstances.
• We assume realization rates of 75% for rental equipment, 80% for unsold accounts receivable (we exclude the assets
and liabilities related to URI's accounts receivable special purpose entity), 65% for inventory, and 40% for other
property and nonrental equipment.
