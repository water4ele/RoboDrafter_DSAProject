Strong market position in Canada with an extensive North American rail network Volumes likely to decline in the event of weaker-than-expected

macroeconomic conditions
Operating efficiency among the strongest of the North American railroads

Network congestion from tight capacity could weaken service

(FOCF)

Well-diversified rail network by customer, end market, and region

Strong free cash flow generation provides financial flexibility. Under our assumptions of low-to-mid single-digit
revenue growth and modestly higher margins, we estimate Canadian National Railway Co. (CN) will generate more
than C$5.8 billion of operating cash flow per year. This easily covers the C$3.8 billion–C$4.0 billion of capital
expenditures in our base-case scenario and should leave more than C$2.0 billion of free operating cash flow (FOCF)
that we assume is used primarily to pay dividends and repurchase shares without materially affecting leverage.
In our view, CN has significant financial flexibility to manage weaker-than-expected cash flow generation related to
slowing macroeconomic conditions. We would expect the company to reduce share repurchases to an extent that
facilitates positive discretionary cash flow and preserves credit measures--consistent with its track record during past
cycles. In a severe or prolonged recession, CN could also reduce or defer a portion of its dividends and capital
expenditures to limit the impact of lower cash flow on its balance sheet. Notwithstanding short-term pressure on credit
measures likely in such a scenario, we believe CN has the capacity and willingness to generate leverage and cash flow
ratios in line with our long-term expectations. This includes adjusted funds from operations (FFO)-to-debt of 40%-45%
and adjusted debt-to-EBITDA of 1.8x-2.0x.

Trade uncertainties and slowing global growth have increased the likelihood of a recession, but we believe CN is well
positioned to manage these risks. We do not believe CN would be materially affected by an escalating trade war, most
notably between the U.S. and China. In our view, CN's diverse product mix and geographic distribution limit the
company's exposure to any one product category or trade negotiation. For instance, we believe trade between China
and the U.S. represents about 5% of revenue. Furthermore, we believe Canada's trade with the U.S. (about one-third of
CN's freight revenue) is likely to remain steady over the next few years with the United States-Mexico-Canada
Agreement signed late last year. While CN is certainly not immune to financial risk from trade restrictions or tariffs
(since about 68% of freight revenue is generated from cross-border and international trade), its revenue base is highly
diversified by bulk, merchandise, and intermodal shipments. In our view, its broad market exposure underpins the
strength of its business and credit profile.
S&P Global Ratings believes trade uncertainties and a persistent weak global industrial backdrop contribute to a
30%-35% probability of a U.S. recession in the next 12 months. We do not assume a recession in our base-case
assumptions, but we consider how CN might perform in such a scenario. Railroads tend to perform well in industry
downturns, as there is often no alternative shipping mode. We estimate adjusted EBITDA could decline 10%-20% if
the company faces a degree of stress similar to the 2008-2009 downturn. Such a scenario is likely to result in credit
measures that are weaker than we currently expect, potentially including adjusted FFO-to-debt below 35% and
adjusted debt-to-EBITDA above 2.5x. However, we believe this would be temporary and (as noted above) the
company would manage share repurchases to return adjusted FFO-to-debt above 35% within a two-year period.

CN is among the most efficient railways in North America. We expect CN's operating efficiency to remain among the
strongest of the North American railroads, underpinned by our forecast adjusted EBIT margins of about 40%, which
we consider above average for Class 1 railroads. The modest expected improvement in profitability stems from
mid-to-high single-digit annual revenue growth we assume along with ongoing investments the company is making to
upgrade its network and renew its equipment. These investments include adding double track, new grain hoppers, and
new locomotives.
Furthermore, 2017 and 2018 operating performance was adversely affected by inefficiencies from congestion issues in
key corridors of CN's network that emerged in the second half of 2017 and by the additional costs required to address
them. CN has since improved network fluidity and efficiencies from recently added employees should continue to
improve through 2020.
In our view, CN's solid operating performance is a testament to the benefits of the scheduled railroading model the
company implemented in the mid-2000s. Having ingrained this operating model into its business well before its U.S.
peers and having made significant investments over the past couple of years to add capacity to its network, the
company has, we believe, relatively lower risk of service disruptions.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects S&P Global Ratings' expectation that over the next few years, CN's adjusted
FFO-to-debt should be 40%-45%. This incorporates our assumption of volume growth and favorable pricing from
strong demand in most end-markets along with a modest improvement in profit margins.

Downside scenario
We could downgrade CN within the next two years if adjusted FFO-to-debt falls below 35% and adjusted
FOCF-to-debt falls below 17.5% for a prolonged period. This could occur if the company adopts more-aggressive
financial policies or if earnings are significantly weaker than we expect, potentially due to lower volumes or pricing
brought on by a severe recession.

Upside scenario
Although it is unlikely over the next two years, we could upgrade CN if stronger-than-expected earnings growth
contributes to adjusted FFO-to-debt above 50% and adjusted FOCF-to-debt above 30%. In this scenario, we would
expect the company to sustain these stronger credit measures, supported by financial policies that are more
conservative than we currently view them, including a reduced proportion of cash flow allocated to
shareholder-friendly initiatives or net debt repayment.

• Upcoming debt maturities are refinanced.

Base-case projections
Strong demand expected to spur low-to-mid single-digit volume and yield growth leading to mid-to-high single-digit
revenue growth. We expect strong demand in the majority of CN's product portfolio will fuel growth in consolidated
volumes and pricing largely due to a still solid macroeconomic environment and tight capacity across various modes
of transportation. We expect this environment will foster mid-to-high single-digit annual revenue growth for the
company over the next couple of years. During the first half of 2019, rail freight revenue was up about 11%, with all
seven product segments up from last year. We assume economic growth in the second half of this year should slow
modestly, resulting in mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth for 2019. We expect mid-single-digit revenue growth in
2020, fueled by favorable macroeconomic conditions and increasing intermodal traffic from the Port of Prince Rupert.
We also see strong demand for crude oil by rail (about 4% of revenue in 2018), at least through 2020, due to delays in
new pipeline capacity.

Company Description
CN is a Canadian Class I railway that serves Canada, as well as the Midwestern and Southern U.S. With a network of
about 19,500 route miles, the company connects the three coasts: the Atlantic, the Pacific, and the Gulf of Mexico. In
2018, CN generated more than C$14 billion of revenue, making it the largest railroad in Canada and the fifth-largest in
North America.

Business Risk: Strong
In our view, CN enjoys a strong competitive position in the long-haul freight transportation industry with limited
competition, significant barriers to entry, and a moderate degree of cyclicality. We believe the company's network
breadth and consolidated industry characteristics, particularly in Canada, support a favorable pricing environment
whereby CN should generally be able to increase freight rates higher than rail inflation (including fuel costs). We also
consider the company's approximately 20,000-route-mile rail network well positioned to service customers, as it
extends to key ports on North America's three major coasts: the Pacific coast (Vancouver and Prince Rupert, B.C.), the
Atlantic coast (Halifax, N.S., and Montreal), and the Gulf of Mexico (New Orleans, La. and Mobile, Ala.). This makes
CN the only Class 1 railroad reaching three coasts with its network. Further bolstering CN's competitive position is its
relatively fluid track going into the high-traffic Chicago area that we believe is a competitive advantage over other
Class I railroads.
Trucking is a competitive alternative on short-haul routes and for time-sensitive freight, and barges and vessels offer
competition on the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Seaway and the Mississippi River System. However, rail remains an
attractive and cost-effective choice for bulk and long-distance commodity traffic, in our opinion.

SEPTEMBER 20, 2019 11

Canadian National Railway Co.

We expect CN's operating efficiency to remain among the strongest of the North American railroads, underpinned by
forecast adjusted EBIT margins of about 40%, is above the average of Class 1 railroads and about in line with CP. The
modest expected improvement in profitability stems primarily from the benefits of operating leverage given the
mid-single-digit annual revenue growth we assume along with ongoing investments the company is making to upgrade
its network and renew its equipment. These investments include adding double track, new grain hoppers, and new
locomotives. The company is also making capital investments in IT to improve inspection productivity, from which we
believe most of the incremental benefit should be realized between 2020 and 2022.
In our view, CN should generate stable earnings due in large part to its geographic, customer, and product diversity.
This typically allows the company to offset weak demand in certain sectors with strong performance in others.
Moreover, fuel surcharge mechanisms are included in most of the company's freight contracts--as is common in the
rail industry, albeit there can sometimes be a lag before rates reset. We believe these mechanisms should mitigate CN's
cost exposure to volatile fuel prices, further supporting our view of the company's earnings stability.

Peer comparison
CN is the fifth largest Class 1 railroad in North America and about half the size of Union Pacific Corp. and Burlington
Northern Santa Fe. Larger rail networks typically benefit from better customer, end-market, and geographic diversity,
along with access to more ports and terminals to better serve customers. That said, we believe CN operates a very
broad network with a diverse product portfolio with very efficient operations.
CN's strong credit profile compared with that of most other Class 1 railroads is in large part based on our expectation
that the company should maintain relatively stronger core credit measures over the long term. These include adjusted
FFO-to-debt of 40%-45% and adjusted debt-to-EBITDA of 1.8x-2.0x.

Financial Risk: Modest
We estimate that CN should generate adjusted FFO-to-debt of 40%-45% and adjusted debt-to-EBITDA of 1.8x-2.0x
over the next few years. We assume annual adjusted EBITDA growth in the high single-digit area as freight volumes
and rates continue to rise through 2020. In this scenario, we believe CN will increase debt to fund a portion of its share
repurchases, thereby maintaining credit measures near current levels.
Under our assumptions, over the next couple of years CN should generate C$2.0 billion-C$2.5 billion of annual FOCF,
which includes elevated levels of annual capital expenditures of about C$3.9 billion (22%-25% of revenue). This
translates into adjusted FOCF-to-debt of about 14%-17% through 2020. While we anticipate this cash flow will
primarily go toward repurchasing shares, we also note that through its ability to redeploy this cash, CN has the
financial flexibility to remain opportunistic regarding investments that may strengthen its competitive position or
reduce debt to maintain steady leverage measures if earnings decline.

Liquidity: Strong
Our liquidity assessment incorporates our view that CN's sources of liquidity will exceed uses by more than 1.5x over
the next 12 months. We also expect that the company will maintain sufficient liquidity to exceed its funding needs
even in a stress scenario whereby our forecast EBITDA declines by 30%. Furthermore, we believe CN has the capacity
to withstand a high-impact, low-probability event with limited need for refinancing; well-established and solid banking
relationships; generally high standing in credit markets with great access to capital markets; and generally very
prudent financial risk management.
We have a short-term rating of 'A-1' on CN, which reflects our 'A' long-term issuer credit rating and strong liquidity
profile on the company.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Cash and cash equivalents of C$612 million at June
30, 2019. This includes C$484 million of restricted
cash that we believe is available to the company
within a short period

• Expected annual capital expenditures of about C$3.9
billion, of which we assume about one-third can be
deferred or cancelled in a stress scenario

• Full availability under its revolving credit facility of
C$2 billion that consists of two C$1 billion tranches
maturing on May 5, 2022 and May 5, 2024,
respectively
• Full availability under a C$450 million accounts
receivable securitization program that matures Feb.
1, 2021 that could be utilized to fund seasonal
working capital requirements
• Annual FFO of more than C$6 billion

• Seasonal working capital investments that typically
peak in the first quarter
• Annual dividend payments of C$1.4 billion-C$1.7
billion and discretion on future share repurchases
through 2020.
• US$961 million (C$1,258 million) of commercial
paper outstanding as at June 30, 2019 that matures
within 90 days
• Other debt maturities within the next 24 months
include, US$300 million due Feb. 3, 2020, C$250
million due Feb. 18, 2021, and US$400 million due
Dec. 15, 2021

Covenant Analysis
Compliance expectations
We believe there is sufficient headroom under CN's financial covenants for EBITDA to be 30% lower than our forecast
without the company breaching its covenant limits.

Requirements
The company's revolving credit facility includes a financial covenant that limits debt as a percentage of total
capitalization.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

ESG factors are not a significant risk to the rating on CN. Transportation of petroleum and chemical products that
we consider CN's most hazardous category represented a modest 11% of carloads in 2018. We believe the
company is among the safest railroads in North America based on Federal Railroad Administration reporting
criteria. That said, operations tend to be more challenging in Canada than in the U.S. due to colder weather
conditions and steeper grades, particularly in parts of Western Canada. This increases the risk of accidents and
service disruptions that we believe the company does a good job managing. CN operates a fuel efficient fleet of
locomotives that on average used 0.94 U.S. gallons per thousand gross ton miles in 2018, which we believe is about
15% lower than the average North American railway. We also believe transporting freight by rail instead of trucks
is significantly more fuel efficient on average, contributing to lower greenhouse gas emissions and higher relative
profitability. Unlike some of its industry peers, CN's customers and employees are not being disrupted by a
transition to scheduled railroading, as CN was an early adopter of this operating model, having implemented it in
the mid-2000's. Furthermore, while just under 80% of the company's workforce is unionized, its labor relations
have been relatively stable.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
As of June 30, 2019, CN's capital structure consisted of just over C$12 billion of unsecured notes and debentures, of
which almost all is outstanding at the parent level. The company's debt outstanding also includes about C$1.3 billion
borrowed under its commercial paper program.

Analytical conclusions
We rate CN's unsecured notes 'A', the same as the issuer credit rating, as no significant elements of subordination risk
are present in the capital structure and the company has a modest financial risk profile.
