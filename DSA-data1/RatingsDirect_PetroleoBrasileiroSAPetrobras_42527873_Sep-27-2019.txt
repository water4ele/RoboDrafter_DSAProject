Overview
Key strengths

Key risks

Well positioned in terms of upstream proven reserve base.

Exposure to volatile and capital-intensive industries with significant risks
inherent to oil-price fluctuations.

Favorable prospects for reserve replenishing and future production
expansion through its focus on pre-salt fields.

Potential government influence on fuel pricing policy, which can harm the
company’s profitability and cash flow generation.

Strong liquidity position and comfortable debt maturity profile.

Geographic concentration in Brazil.

Petrobras is continuing its divestment plan. The goal is to exit or reduce the company's stake in several segments, such
as fertilizers, midstream and downstream assets, and shallow water, onshore, and mature oil and gas fields. The result
will be a company focused on exploration and production (E&P), mainly in deep and ultra-deep water fields, where
Petrobras has extensive expertise and efficient operations, translating into a substantial competitive advantage.
Debt reduction to continue with proceeds from asset sales. The company already received about $12.8 billion in the first
half of 2019, and our base-case forecast assumes about $9 billion in additional asset sales until 2020. These figures
exclude the sale of eight refineries, which management expects to complete by 2021, given uncertainties about timing
and amounts. With proceeds from asset sales, we expect Petrobras to continue reducing its gross debt, to reach its
target of net debt to EBITDA below 1.5x in 2020.

Petrobras will remain exposed to the inherent volatility of oil and gas prices, even more following the divestments in
midstream and downstream operations. However, the company should be able to mitigate this through the increasing
share of production in pre-salt fields, where it has been achieving constant increases in productivity, with lifting costs
as low as $6 per boe in the second quarter of 2019. Also, the company has been focusing on reducing overall costs and
expenses at various organization levels, such as closing some offices and reducing office space, as well as investing in
digital initiatives to improve efficiency.

Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on the company incorporates that on Brazil, which in turns, caps our ratings on Petrobras.
Given Petrobras' very strong link with the government, we don't believe the company could currently have a higher
rating than its controlling shareholder. Our outlook also incorporates our view that Petrobras will maintain its solid
operating performance and fairly stable cash flows, reflecting the contribution from new projects and from its
profitable upstream assets. We also expect management to remain committed to its primary goal of debt reduction,
which supports the rating.

Upside scenario
An upgrade of Petrobras depends on an upgrade of Brazil, or our view of a weaker link between the government
and Petrobras. That would mean that a likelihood of a government interference during future credit stress
scenarios--that go beyond the ones already incorporated into our stand-alone credit profile (SACP)--is lower and
evidence of the impact of such mitigating factors are. A higher SACP could follow greater headroom in the
company's credit metrics to withstand potentially volatile oil prices or unexpected sovereign interference. In such a
scenario, we expect the company to maintain adjusted net debt to EBITDA at 2.0x-3.0x, funds from operations
(FFO) to net debt above 30%, and free operating cash flow (FOCF) to net debt above 10% in a consistent manner
for the next 12-24 months. It would also require a conservative approach to growth and shareholder remuneration
and continued supportive production economics at Petrobras' main upstream assets.

Downside scenario
If we downgrade Brazil, we would take the same rating action on Petrobras. Absent any sovereign rating action,
while our current assessment of extraordinary government support remains unchanged, a downgrade would occur
if the company's SACP were to fall to 'b+' or lower. Although currently unlikely, this could follow a sharp and
pronounced oil price decline or a deterioration in downstream profitability due to a less independent price policy,
which leads to adjusted net debt to EBITDA consistently above 5.0x and FFO to net debt below 12%.

Assumptions

• Average Brent oil price of $63 per barrel (bbl) for
2019 (considering the first half of 2019 average and
our price deck of $60 for the rest of the year). For
2020, we assume $60/bbl and $55/bbl starting in
2021.
• Average exchange rate of R$3.9 per $1 in 2019,
R$3.95 per $1 in 2020, and R$3.98 per $1 in 2021.
• Company's oil production in Brazil increasing about
8.5% in 2019 and 5% annually in the following years.
This is a result of new production systems, mainly
extraction in ultra-deep waters.

• Lifting costs at $10-$11 per boe, benefiting in the
medium term from the ramp-up of new pre-salt
fields, in which the company has lower costs.
• Stable refining costs at about $2.5 per bbl.
• We assume that Petrobras will keep its gasoline and
diesel prices in line with international prices,
reflecting its active pricing strategy.
• Annual capex of $10 billion - $14 billion in 2019 and
2020, and $16.5 billion in 2021, mainly for the
development of pre-salt fields.
• Cash inflows from asset-sales of about $14 billion in
2019 and $6 billion in 2020.
• These proceeds and FOCF used to pay down debt.

Base-case projections
Petrobras will receive about $9 billion from the government in December 2019, linked to the surplus oil bidding round,
due to the agreement regarding the transfer of rights. We expect Petrobras to use most or all of the proceeds to invest
in E&P.
Focus is on debt reduction, but we believe Petrobras would increase dividends as net leverage target approaches 1.5x.
Assuming additional cash inflows from asset sales over the next quarters, adequate market conditions with stable or
increasing oil prices, and controlled capex, the company would likely use some excess cash to remunerate
shareholders.
Expected sale of refineries will likely reduce the risk of potential governmental interference in Petrobras' fuel pricing
mechanics. It could lead to a more free market approach rather than government price limits to control inflation, which
has historically harmed Petrobras' profitability.

Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras

Company Description
Petrobras is Brazil's national integrated oil and gas company, founded in 1953. It has market capitalization of more
than $80 billion. The government directly holds 50.3% of the company's voting capital and 28.7% of total capital.
Petrobras holds and operates the main oil and gas fields in Brazil, with a significant amount of net proven
reserves--12.0 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe) according to the Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural
Gas, and Biofuels and the Society of Petroleum Engineers. The company's reserves total 9.6 boe, according to the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission's criteria as of December 2018. Petrobras has total oil and gas production of
about 2.6 million boe (MMboe). Petrobras' downstream activities are refining and marketing. With its significant
divestment plan that aims to reduce debt, the company is focusing on its core activities: E&P.
Chart 2

Business Risk: Satisfactory
Petrobras' E&P business is sound in terms of the scale, quality, lifetime, and replacement reserve level. On the other
hand, the company is exposed to highly volatile and cyclical commodity sectors, which results in inherent challenges,

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 24, 2019 7

Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras

such as reserve replacement and maintaining production levels. Still, we believe Petrobras is now better placed to
withstand an industry downturn because of better profitability in its downstream business and continued
cost-reduction efforts in upstream, with an average portfolio breakeven level below $40/bbl. The company has a large
portfolio of greenfield projects, which should support production growth over the next several years. These projects
will bring higher-margin barrels that will benefit from a rebalanced cost structure. We also expect Petrobras to
continue overhauling its exploratory portfolio, actively participating in Brazil's bidding rounds.With the maintenance of
gasoline and diesel prices in line with international prices, along with cost-cutting initiatives and focus on more
efficient operations, we expect the company to post EBITDA margin 43%-50% in the next 2-3 years.

Peer comparison
Petrobras is one of the main oil players in Latin America along with Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX), Ecopetrol S.A.,
and YPF S.A. It compares favorably among these players in terms of production levels and proven reserves. On the
other hand, Petrobras has historically higher leverage than Ecopetrol and YPF, although it will get closer to these peers
following the completion of debt reduction.Same as Petrobras, the ratings on the other three Latin American entities
are linked to their respective sovereign ratings, given their state-owned status and our view of potential support or
influence. The rating on PEMEX is higher because the sovereign rating is higher than the company's SACP. On the
contrary, Petrobras and YPF ratings are lower than their respective SACPs because of lower sovereign ratings.We also
view Petrobras as well positioned among major integrated E&P companies in terms of its reserve base. On the other
hand, the peers in general have a much lighter balance sheet than Petrobras and have larger scale, sound level of
integration, and geographic diversity, resulting in higher ratings.

Financial Risk: Aggressive
With proceeds from asset sales and meaningful FOCF, along with plans for lower capex, we expect Petrobras to
continue reducing gross debt, at least until next year, to reach its net leverage goal of less than 1.5x. We expect the
company to continue pre-paying higher cost debt, which will also lead to lower interest burden, as it continues to
gradually extend its debt tenor. While credit metrics are improving, we might see somewhat higher volatility in the
future, given that Petrobras will reduce its integration level by divesting midstream and downstream operations,
increasing its exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations. If amid this potential volatility, the company is able to
maintain debt to EBITDA below 3.0x, FFO to debt above 30%, and FOCF to debt above 10% in a consistent manner,
we could revise our financial risk profile assessment to a stronger category.

Liquidity: Strong
We assess Petrobras' liquidity as strong. The company's healthy cash balance, significant undrawn bank lines, and
FOCF support this assessment. We expect Petrobras to continue to have solid access to banks and capital markets,
given its stronger governance and lighter balance sheet. As a result, we expect the company's sources of liquidity to be
at least 1.5x higher than its uses for the next 12 months.

Covenant Analysis
Petrobras' outstanding debt obligations don't have acceleration financial covenants. Its BNDES loans have financial
covenants of net debt to EBITDA of maximum of 5.5x, with no fixed assets given as guarantees. If the company
breaches the ratio, it's supposed to give 130% of the loan amount as real guarantees.

Compliance expectations
We expect the company to maintain a very comfortable cushion on BNDES covenants, given that the company
continues to reduce leverage.

SEPTEMBER 24, 2019 13

Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras

Environmental, Social, And Governance

Governance factors are key drivers of Petrobras' credit quality. The company's market access, operating
performance, and profitability were severely hit by the corruption investigation that started in 2014. However, we
believe Petrobras took appropriate measures to improve its internal controls, relationship with suppliers, and
decision-making process, which prompted us to assess its management and governance as fair (previously, it was
weak). Though it's too early to say if these changes will be sustainable through future government changes in
Brazil, we view Petrobras' governance as comparable to those of its global industry peers. We expect oil and gas
companies' profitability to be cyclical due to price volatility. Until 2014, Petrobras was unable to take full
advantage of the price peaks to bolster its cash flows because of the government's attempts to contain inflation and
social tensions by constraining the fuel prices that Petrobras could charge. With the improved governance
framework and prices now following international parity, we believe Petrobras will be able to benefit from price
peaks in line with global peers.
Petrobras' strategy for the next 5-10 years should continue to focus on the company's traditional offshore
production. We believe that large offshore deepwater and ultradeepwater producers, like Petrobras, and drillers are
more exposed than global peers to environmental factors, given the potential impact that spills could have on their
operations.
The company has committed to zero growth of absolute operating emissions through planned investments in
natural gas and renewable energy. The capex commitment (about 6.5% of total capex) doesn't represent a risk to
leverage or profitability, in our view. We also don't think safety and labor relations are a major credit concern at
this point. The company's reported accident rate is comparable to those of the best companies in the sector.

Rating Above The Sovereign
Given Petrobras' very strong link with the government, we don't believe the company could currently have a higher
rating than its controlling shareholder. We acknowledge a meaningful risk of extraordinary government intervention in
the company during the sovereign's hypothetical fiscal stress. As a result, we don't view Petrobras' ability and
willingness to service its debt as superior to that of the government. Furthermore, we view the government as a strong
and stable shareholder, with influence on Petrobras' strategy and business plans and a tight association with the
company in terms of reputation. Given that minority shareholders don't have veto power or substantial influence over
cash flow decisions and that the government ultimately controls the board, we assume that if Brazil were to be in
financial distress, it could draw support from Petrobras, even if the need for it appears remote at this point.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
We don't apply a recovery analysis on Petrobras because domestic legislation doesn't provide a clear path to
restructuring of government related entities in Brazil. Therefore, we're not in a position to assess the timing or

procedures in the event of Petrobras' insolvency.

Capital structure
Petrobras' capital structure mainly consists of senior unsecured debt (about 50% of total debt) from capital markets
issued by the financing vehicles, PGF and Pifco, and guaranteed by Petrobras, apart from bank loans. There is no
material secured debt collateralized by real assets.

Analytical conclusions
The rating on Petrobras' senior unsecured debt is the same as our issuer credit rating on the company because it has
limited secured debt. Even if the senior unsecured debt ranked behind the debt issued by subsidiaries in the capital
structure, we believe the risk of subordination is mitigated by a priority debt ratio that's far less than 50% and by the
material earnings generated by the parent.

Until 2018, our debt measures included the net present value of company's future lease payments calculated using a
7% discount rate as per our criteria. We used the future lease payments reported off-balance sheet within the notes in
the company's financial statements. About 40% of the amounts that the company reported company as future lease
commitments as of Dec. 31, 2018, corresponded to assets under construction.
With the adoption of IFRS 16, Petrobras now reports the present value of future lease commitments related to
operating assets on its balance sheet. According to our criteria, when a company capitalizes all leases on its balance
sheet, we generally accept that treatment. As a result, starting in 2019, we will calculate debt measures for Petrobras
by considering the lease figures it reports in its balance sheet. This means our historical adjusted debt will no longer
include the future lease commitments related to assets under construction or not yet available for use, but we are
including those in our forecasts as the assets become operational. While this will result in a significant change in our
adjusted debt measures, it will be offset by a similar change in EBITDA so that the impact on ratios won't be
meaningful. For example, our debt to EBITDA ratio for 2018 was 3.8x given leases both for assets in operation and in
construction. If we were to exclude assets under construction from the lease adjustment, debt to EBITDA for 2018
would have been 3.4x.
