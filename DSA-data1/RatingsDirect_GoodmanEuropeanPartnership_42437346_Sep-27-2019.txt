The logistics markets demonstrate supportive fundamentals in the countries where
Goodman European Partnership (GEP) operates.

Smaller scale and less diversification than other
European logistics players, such as Logicor or Prologis
European Logistics Fund, could affect cash flow
stability in a downturn.

GEP has a high-quality portfolio in the main European logistics corridors, and a long
track record of good operating performance and above-average occupancy rates.

Although logistics has shown good momentum, we
consider it more volatile and less resilient than other
real estate segments, such as residential.

GEP has robust coverage ratios and low leverage, demonstrated by an S&P Global
Ratings-adjusted debt-to-debt-plus-equity ratio of 30.9%. It follows a prudent financial
policy and has committed to maintaining a reported gearing ratio at the lower end of its
30%-45% target.

Tenant concentration is higher than its European
peers; the top-10 tenants represent 47.5% of the total
income.

We expect the logistics segment to continue to perform solidly in the coming years. Demand for logistics assets is
supported by the ongoing rise of e-commerce across Europe, increased consumer demand for rapid delivery of goods,
and the reconfiguration of global supply chains. The expansion of supply has been disciplined, with relatively low
levels of speculative development.

We expect that GEP will maintain high occupancy rates of around 96%-98% and will achieve annual rental growth of
about 1.5%-2.0%, despite the slowdown in GDP growth across Europe. Luxembourg-incorporated real estate
investment fund GEP's high-quality portfolio should allow it to continue to attract and retain good-quality tenants, and
to maintain high occupancy levels. Historically, its occupancy levels have been above the market average. We assume
rental growth slightly above the consumer price index (CPI) in GEP's markets.

Leverage is currently low; we expect GEP to allow it to rise, but to maintain credit metrics commensurate with our
rating. GEP is likely to expand its existing portfolio further, through acquisitions and by developing assets in
partnership with Goodman Group. Its financial policy target is to keep total assets minus cash to debt minus cash at
about 30%-45%. Over time, we expect its leverage to move to the lower end of this range, from 27.3% on June 30,
2019. This should translate into an adjusted debt-to-debt-plus-equity ratio of 34%-40%.

SEPTEMBER 11, 2019 4

Goodman European Partnership

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our view that GEP's portfolio will continue to generate stable and recurring income in a
supportive logistics market in the coming two years. We expect leverage to increase slightly toward GEP's financial
policy target. Meanwhile, the debt-to-debt-plus-equity ratio would move to 35%, debt to EBITDA increase slightly
to 7x, and EBITDA interest cover remain above 8x in the next 24 months.

Upside scenario
A positive rating action would depend on GEP significantly increasing its asset base while improving its financial
ratios such that debt to debt-plus-equity falls below 30% and EBITDA interest coverage remains well above 4.5x.
An upgrade would also be contingent on GEP increasing the scale and diversification of its portfolio while
maintaining the existing quality and its current good operating performance.

Downside scenario
We could lower our rating on GEP if the debt-to-debt-plus-equity ratio rose to more than 40%. This could result
from a higher-than-expected level of debt-financed acquisitions. We could also lower the rating if we saw a
sustained deterioration in GEP's rental activities, which translated into negative rental growth or a material
decrease in occupancy rates.

GEP is one of the leading logistics funds in Europe and has a prime portfolio consisting of €3.5 billion (as of June 30,
2019) of logistics assets across 10 countries. The portfolio is weighted to its core markets of Germany, France, Poland,
Belgium, and the Netherlands, which in total represents 89.6% of the portfolio. GEP is managed by the Goodman
Group, a leading international owner, developer and manager of industrial properties.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
GEP's portfolio consists of prime logistics properties that have an average building age of less than seven years,
younger than that of other players in the industry. These assets are well-located in the main European logistics
corridors across robust markets such as Germany and France. In total, as of Dec. 31, 2018, GEP's 109 assets cover
over 4 million square meters, perform well, and have a high occupancy rate of 96.2% (97.5% if we look to the stabilized
portfolio only).
GEP's assets have historically had a high occupancy rate--the 10-year average is about 97% for the stabilized core
properties. About a third of the total portfolio has green certifications. Ownership of "last mile" assets, which enable a
provider to service all the steps of the supply chain, has become increasingly important and GEP's portfolio
incorporates enough of this type of asset that it can reach a material population in the last kilometres of the supply
chain.
GEP enjoys a leading position in the markets where it operates. That said, it has a smaller European presence than two
of its closest rated competitors:

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 11, 2019 10

Goodman European Partnership

• Prologis European Logistics Fund FCP-FIS (PELF; A-/Stable/ A-2), which has a portfolio of 475 assets valued at
about €10.6 billion; and
• Logicor Financing S.a.r.l. (BBB/Stable/A-2), which has a portfolio of 621 assets valued at €12.5 billion.
GEP is present in 10 countries in continental Europe where we expect demand and investor appetite for logistics
assets to remain supportive. GEP is also exposed to some Central and Eastern European countries. In the past, these
have been more volatile, but they represent a small portion of the company's total portfolio value (Poland 13.4%,
Hungary 3.1%). Although these markets have performed relatively well in the past couple of years, the incremental
supply of new facilities is driving high competition, especially in Poland.
GEP also enjoys a healthy tenant base, high retention rates of around 80%, and a good average lease duration (4.7
years stabilized portfolio weighted-average lease expiry).
However, the top-10 tenants display a certain level of concentration and represent 47.5% of the total income. Amazon
is GEP's largest customer and represented 12.2% of income on June 30, 2019. On the positive side, GEP has solid
long-term relationships with these tenants, Amazon's credit quality is strong at 'AA-/Stable', and GEP has a diverse
offering in terms of asset types and regions.
GEP has limited exposure to speculative development risk and benefits from an active acquisition pipeline under its
contractual arrangements with its sponsor, Australia-based real estate company Goodman Group (BBB+/Stable). By
sharing or transferring development risk to Goodman Group, GEP can incorporate high-quality, modern, sustainable
assets into its portfolio. This represents a solid competitive advantage for the fund compared with other players, which
rely on buying properties available in the market, which are usually older.
Both GEP and Goodman Group have long operating track records. We understand that the fund is not required to
provide ongoing liquidity if a unitholder wants to redeem its stake, which should limit downside pressure in a
downturn. The previous liquidity review was performed in July 2016, where investors had the option to exit (level of
redemptions was nonmaterial), and the next one is due in July 2026.
Although the portfolio mainly comprises prime quality logistics properties, the rents and valuations of which are
generally more resilient than older or less-specialized properties in the industrial and logistics segments, GEP is only
exposed to the logistics property segment, which suffered from a sharp fall in values in 2009-2010. The sector has
benefited from material yield compression in the past few years, but we still consider it more volatile than other real
estate sectors, such as residential.

Financial Risk: Intermediate
Our assessment of GEP's financial risk profile is underpinned by the fund's prudent financial policy and commitment to
maintain its gearing ratio (total assets minus cash to debt minus cash) at the lower end of its 30%-45% target. This
should translate into an adjusted debt-to-debt-plus-equity between 34%-40%. We also gain comfort from its proven
track record of raising equity, which would allow GEP to maintain commensurate levels of leverage while its portfolio
continues to grow through acquisitions and asset development. As of March 31, 2019, €277.5 million of equity
remained available to GEP.

*7.0 years if we consider the recent refinancing of GEP's 2021 bond maturity.

GEP's 2018 asset disposals brought in proceeds of €626.5 million. As a result of this high amount, the fund's leverage
was at historically low levels--the debt-to-debt-plus-equity ratio was 30.9% on Dec. 31, 2018.
We expect GEP to expand its portfolio further through positive net acquisitions and asset developments in partnership
with Goodman Group. GEP's gearing, measured as total assets minus cash to debt minus cash, is likely to increase
slightly over time from 26.9% at year-end 2018, toward the lower end of the 30%-45% target range. This should

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 11, 2019 13

Goodman European Partnership

translate into a debt-to-debt-plus-equity ratio of 34%-40%.
Over the past few years, GEP has benefited from substantial yield compression in its assets, but this trend is coming to
an end in most of its markets. Therefore, we expect to see lower valuation uplifts in the coming years.
Chart 7

Our base case also assumes that rental rates will grow by about 1.5%-2.0% in the next few years. Demand for GEP's
assets is good and rental contracts are usually indexed to CPI. Sustained rental growth and a low weighted average
cost of debt at 1.8% should allow GEP to maintain a strong EBITDA interest cover above 8x.

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 11, 2019 14

Goodman European Partnership

Chart 8

GEP also enjoyed a long weighted-average debt maturity of 4.2 years on June 30, 2019. In July 2019, GEP refinanced
its €400 million bond maturing in 2021 with a €400 million issuance maturing in 2029 and a coupon of 1.125% (versus
an existing coupon of 1.75%).
GEP's unsecured lenders benefit from a large pool of unencumbered assets--100% of its total debt facilities are
unsecured. Therefore, our issue rating on the unsecured bonds issued by GELF Bond Issuer I S.A. (which benefit from
unconditional guarantees from GEP) remain aligned with the issuer credit rating on GEP, because the ratio of secured
debt to total assets is well below 40%.

Liquidity: Adequate
We continue to assess GEP's liquidity as adequate based on its ratio of liquidity sources to uses of over 1.2x over the
12 months from March 31, 2019.
GEP's liquidity position is supported by the lack of material debt maturities until 2022 and its good access to new
equity. GEP's backup facility of €200 million is regularly partially drawn. It is also somewhat smaller than backup
facilities at other rated players, to which we ascribe a stronger liquidity assessment (for example, PELF's undrawn
backup facilities were €520 million, as of Dec. 31, 2018). GEP has also demonstrated good access to the debt capital
markets in the past, although it accesses debt markets less regularly than some other issuers.

March 2019;

million;

Debt maturities

the third quarter of 2019.

Other Credit Considerations
GEP's credit metrics compare favorably with those of other rated peers that have the same anchor or financial risk
assessment. This reflects the company's conservative financial policy. It has committed to maintaining a reported

gearing, measured as total assets minus cash to debt minus cash, at the lower end of 30%-45%. Therefore, we modify
the anchor upward by one notch to reflect our positive comparable ratings assessment.
