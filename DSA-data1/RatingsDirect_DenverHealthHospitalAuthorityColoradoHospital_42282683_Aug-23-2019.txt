Long Term Rating

Rationale
S&P Global Ratings assigned its 'BBB' long-term rating to the Denver Health & Hospital Authority (DHHA), Colo.'s
$83.79 million series 2019A revenue bonds. At the same time, S&P Global Ratings affirmed its 'BBB' rating on DHHA's
existing debt. The outlook is stable.
The 2019 issuance comprises two series: the $83.79 million series 2019A bonds and the $46.54 series 2019B bonds.
We will not rate the series 2019B bonds, which will be directly purchased by UMB Bank. Proceeds from the series
2019 issuance will refund much of DHHA's existing debt, including its series 2007A, series 2009A, and series 2015
bonds. The series 2019 issuance also includes approximately $24 million of new money. This money will be used to
partly fund DHHA's outpatient medical center (OMC) project. However, we view the series 2019 issuance as
effectively debt-neutral, as in early August 2019, DHHA spent $23.8 million of cash to fully defease its series 2010
bonds. As a result, the series 2019 issuance will not materially change DHHA's pro forma debt or cash levels.
The rating continues to reflect our view of DHHA's role as a fully integrated health care delivery system, along with its
status as an essential public provider of key health care and community services, including an acute-care hospital, one
of the region's level 1 trauma service providers and an emergency medical transport operator, and a nationally
recognized poison control center. DHHA holds an improving market position in the competitive and rapidly growing
Denver market. The rating also reflects DHHA's role as the provider of many ambulatory care services--including
federally qualified health centers and many school-based services--and as the operator of a provider-sponsored health
plan known as the Denver Health Medical Plan (DHMP).
The rating also reflects DHHA's multiyear trend of improved operations, generating sound pro forma maximum annual
debt service (MADS) coverage. This improvement reflects management's ongoing focus on revenue growth and
expense reduction. DHHA faced some one-time challenges in the first half of fiscal 2019 (ended June 30, 2019), but we
believe some of these issues have been addressed, and expect operations to improve in the second half of 2019,
although operations will likely be softer than in 2018. We will continue to monitor DHHA's operating margin and cash
flow closely, as we recognize that management must sustain solid operations in order to support its capital plans and
long-term growth strategy. DHHA's balance sheet, while only adequate for many years, has improved somewhat over
time. However, the hospital is currently executing an ambitious capital strategy, notably its OMC project, which began
construction in 2018 and has a total budget of $166.1 million. Given DHHA's relatively thin liquidity, we view ongoing

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

AUGUST 20, 2019 2

Denver Health & Hospital Authority, Colorado; Hospital

healthy cash flows as essential to support completion of this project.
Other factors supporting the 'BBB' rating include our view of DHHA's:
• Strong public essentiality as the county's safety net provider and consistent funding support from the City and
County of Denver, as well as support from the state through special funding programs such as disproportionate
share and provider tax funding,
• Improved operations in 2018, and continued profitability (albeit with somewhat softer operations) through the first
six months of 2019; and
• Comprehensive strategic plan that builds on existing system strengths, while demonstrating a focus on revenue
growth, efficiencies, and cost-containment measures.
Partly offsetting these strengths, in our view, are DHHA's:
• Considerable reliance on governmental funding, although the funding itself reflects DHHA's essentiality, and
• Risks inherent in the sizable OMC project.

Outlook
The stable outlook reflects our view of DHHA's strong enterprise profile and stabilized financial performance, including
our expectation that fiscal 2019 operations will improve by year-end. The stable outlook also reflects our view that
DHHA will be able to generate cash flow sufficient to support its sizable capital plans over the next few years.

Upside scenario
We believe the enterprise profile would support a higher rating over time if DHHA's operations stabilize, with MADS
coverage consistently above 3.5x, and balance sheet ratios at or near current levels.

Downside scenario
We could consider a negative outlook or rating action if MADS coverage declines consistently below 2x, or if
unrestricted reserves decline such that days' cash drops below 100. We would also view negatively any delays or other
issues with the construction or operationalization of the OMC and associated projects. Finally, while not expected, any
adverse changes to DHHA's special funding arrangements could also be a negative rating factor.

Enterprise Profile: Strong
City support
DHHA has historically received significant support from the City and County of Denver, as well as the state of
Colorado, which we consider a key credit strength. DHHA is the largest provider of care for Medicaid and uninsured
patients in the state of Colorado. In addition, DHHA operates the medical response for the 911 system in Denver and
operates the nationally known Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Safety (RMPDS), located three blocks from DHHA's
Denver headquarters. The RMPDS provides call services not only for the city and county of Denver, but also for other
cities, counties, and states across the country, as well as for four pharmaceutical companies. Pursuant to DHHA's

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

AUGUST 20, 2019 3

Denver Health & Hospital Authority, Colorado; Hospital

operating agreement with the city, it receives annual funding to support care for the uninsured, public health services,
and correctional care; this totaled approximately $56 million in 2018, and is expected to grow slightly in 2019. This
funding agreement is exclusive to DHHA, and cannot be revoked.
The city of Denver also supports DHHA's capital projects, including the OMC. In November 2017, 69% of Denver
residents voted to approve a $75 million general obligation bond to fund the OMC project. This is only the most recent
in a series of projects funded at least in part by the city. The city has also participated in construction or purchase of
most of DHHA's nine federally qualified health center clinics.

Management
Management has updated and implemented its long-range plan for DHHA, and we consider it sound. It includes
numerous growth initiatives and reflects the continued growth in Medicaid revenues, but also highlights the need to
grow nongovernmental revenues as well. We note this plan has shown some early success, with commercial net
patient revenue growing by approximately $35.6 million in 2018, and accounting for a larger percentage of total net
patient revenue. DHHA continues to target labor and benefit expense as a major opportunity for cost savings.
Management also continues to strengthen the managed care competency, and is working to increase certain lines of
business within the DHMP, notably Medicare.
The management team has good disclosure practices, in our view. In addition, the team has focused on diversifying
the revenue base, building the balance sheet, and fortifying the business position. We view these actions favorably.
Management also continues to focus on efficiencies and quality. We believe that this focus positions the organization
well for the ongoing shift toward value-based reimbursement, although DHHA's heavy reliance on government payors
and special funding remains a point of concern, particularly given the uncertainty surrounding health policy at the
federal level.

Financial Profile: Adequate
Financial performance
Following a low point in fiscal 2016, operations improved over the last two full fiscal years, with a solid operating
performance in fiscal 2018. DHHA's management team continues to implement its turnaround plan, with
demonstrated success in volume growth in several key areas, including trauma and inpatient and outpatient surgery.
Management also significantly improved its revenue cycle process, with a $36 million improvement in collections in
fiscal 2018. At the same time, DHHA successfully slowed its expense growth, including a $3 million reduction in
contracted service expenses. Governmental funding remains critical to DHHA's operating performance, but this has
grown over the last several years.
Through the first six months of fiscal 2019, DHHA is generating positive operating income, but has seen some
softening from fiscal 2018. The hospital's revenue has declined as its Medicaid Choice managed care plan moved to
DHMP (which is not consolidated into the financial results). This resulted in a change in the state's system of
attributing members to the plan, leading to a decline of approximately 10,600 members, which in turn reduced
DHHA's profitability. We understand that the state has updated its attribution system, and that plan membership
increased by a total of approximately 13,000 members in July and August 2019. DHHA is also experiencing softer
inpatient volumes, due in large part to a change in state policy that no longer mandates that certain dialysis patients
receive their care in an inpatient setting. Still, management continues to execute on its expense management strategy,
and DHHA has seen growth in surgical cases and outpatient visits. Given the increase in Medicaid plan membership,
along with management's ongoing efforts to grow revenues and control expenses, we believe DHHA will approach its
budgeted $10.8 million operating income at year-end.

Capital plans
DHHA is currently in the process of constructing the OMC and a new parking structure. The total cost of the OMC
project is $166.1 million, with $75 million funded by the city of Denver and the remaining funds coming from the $23.8
million series 2019 new-money issuance, reserves, cash flows, and philanthropy. The facility will be a seven-story,
293,000-square-foot building on DHHA's campus, and will house outpatient and specialty services. The facility will
allow for growth of DHHA's ambulatory business, and will create cost savings by centralizing and consolidating certain
service lines. The OMC is expected to open to patients in fall 2020. The parking structure was funded by the series
2018 certificates of participation, and is designated for employee parking, as the current employee parking structure
will be converted to patient use for the OMC. The facility has 1,245 spaces, and is expected to open in mid-2020.
The city of Denver has historically provided considerable capital support for DHHA, which is one of the supporting

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

AUGUST 20, 2019 5

Denver Health & Hospital Authority, Colorado; Hospital

strengths of DHHA's credit profile as it helps supplant DHHA's own funds, thus allowing DHHA to operate with a
balance sheet we consider adequate.

Liquidity and debt
We understand that DHHA's cash balance fluctuates somewhat depending on receipt of funds from the city and state.
While the balance sheet has improved modestly over time, we expect it to remain relatively flat over the next few
years as DHHA spends cash and some reserves to fund the construction of the OMC. We also understand that cash
levels were somewhat inflated as of June 30, 2019, and have since declined with the cash defeasance of the series 2010
bonds. Still, given DHHA's improved cash flows, we view its liquidity as acceptable at the current rating level.
The series 2019 transaction eliminates much of DHHA's contingent debt. However, we may consider the series 2019B
direct placement as a contingent liability. We will review the terms of this direct placement when they become
available.
DHHA has one floating to fixed rate swap, which will be eliminated as part of the series 2019 refunding.
