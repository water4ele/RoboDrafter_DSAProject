Credit Highlights
Overview
Key strengths

Key weaknesses

Lower-risk, rate-regulated, and vertically integrated electric utility.

Relatively small customer base with limited geographic and
regulatory diversity.

Financial measures that are consistent with the range for the company’s
financial risk profile category.

Lack of connectivity to the continental U.S. electric grid.

On track to meeting robust renewable portfolio standard (RPS) goals in
Hawaii as the company’s utility subsidiaries transition away from their
oil-based generation portfolio to renewables.

Historically challenging regulatory environment in Hawaii for its
utility subsidiaries, as reflected by significant delays for rate case
orders, leading to regulatory lag.

Despite a historically challenging regulatory environment that has led to significant regulatory lag, the company has
been gradually reducing regulatory delay. The company has been gradually improving its management of regulatory
risk, capitalizing on its timely rate case filings and effective use of regulatory mechanisms. We expect the company to
continue to narrow the gap between earned and allowed returns on equity.
Hawaii has an aggressive 100% renewable energy by 2045 Renewables Portfolio Standard (RPS) goal.The company
has made strong progress toward Hawaii's renewable energy goals, with about 27% of its portfolio from renewables as
of year-end 2018. The company's ability to meet these standards in a timely manner, without any meaningful
detriment to its financial or business risk profiles, is key to maintaining our rating on the company.
Performance-based regulation (PBR) in Hawaii is in its early stages. Under our base case, we expect that the proposed
framework, as it comes to fruition, will ultimately be implemented in a credit-supportive and gradual manner.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on Hawaiian Electric Co. Inc. (HECO) reflects that of its parent, Hawaii Electric Industries Inc.
(HEI), because we consider HECO as a core entity to HEI under our group rating methodology and as such we
equalize the ratings on HECO with those of HEI.
The stable outlook on HEI reflects S&P Global Ratings' view that the parent holdco will continue to focus on its
regulated utility operation, through subsidiary HECO, and to effectively manage regulatory risk while maintaining
stable financial measures with consolidated funds from operations (FFO) to debt of 15%-17%. We expect that HEI
will continue to benefit from the decoupling framework in place while striving to work effectively with the utility
regulator to increase the contribution of renewable energy in its portfolio without increasing business risk or
compromising its financial integrity.

Downside scenario
We could lower the ratings on HECO over the next 12 to 24 months if the company's business risk increases due to
regulatory developments that complicate the company's ability to fully recover its invested capital or due to an
inability to deliver timely and on-budget performance for large projects, leading to weaker financial performance.
We could also lower the rating if parent HEI's consolidated financial measures weaken, reflecting FFO to debt
consistently below 13%.

Upside scenario
We could raise the ratings on HECO over the next 12-24 months if parent HEI's consolidated FFO to debt
improves to 21%-23%, reflecting the higher end of the range for its financial risk profile category.

Hawaiian Electric Co. Inc.

Company Description
Hawaiian Electric Co. Inc. (HECO) operates as a subsidiary of Hawaiian Electric Industries Inc. (HEI). HECO and its
subsidiaries, Hawaii Electric Light Co. Inc. (HELCO) and Maui Electric Co. Ltd. (MECO), engage in the production,
purchase, transmission, and distribution of electricity across the state of Hawaii, excluding the island of Kauai. HECO
and its subsidiaries have a net generation capacity of about 2,220 megawatts (MW). HECO and the subsidiaries
represent about 80% of HEI's consolidated EBITDA.

Business Risk: Strong
Our assessment of HECO's business risk continues to reflect the utility's lower-risk, rate-regulated, and vertically
integrated electric utility business as well as its management of regulatory risk that is consistent with peers.
The Hawaii Public Utilities Commission (HPUC) regulates HECO. The regulatory environment in Hawaii has been
somewhat challenging, with significant regulatory lag as the rate case duration often lasts more than two years.
However, the company has been gradually improving its management of regulatory risk and has been slowly
narrowing the gap between its earned and allowed returns on equity through regular rate case filings and the use of
many constructive regulatory mechanisms. In 2018, the company received a final rate decrease of about $600,000 at
HECO, a final rate decrease of about $100,000 at HELCO, and a final rate increase of about $12.5 million at MECO,
incorporating the effects of tax reform. Currently, the company is requesting a $13.4 million rate increase at HELCO.
Overall, we assess HECO's management of regulatory risk as consistent with peers.
HECO continues to benefit from the use of several constructive regulatory mechanisms including: a sales decoupling
mechanism, revenue adjustment mechanism, major projects cost adjustment mechanism, energy cost and purchased
power adjustment mechanism, a pension and post-retirement welfare benefit tracker, and a renewable energy
infrastructure surcharge. In addition, the company recently received approval from the HPUC for the first phase of its
grid modernization plan. Currently, approximately 17% of HECO customers have installed distributed generation, the
highest in the U.S. While the regulatory mechanisms partially mitigate some of the company's revenue risks associated
with distributed generation, continued high distributed generation growth could challenge the company's ability to
effectively manage the grid over the longer term.
Our business risk also reflects HECO's relatively small customer base and limited geographic diversity. The utility
serves about 460,000 electric customers spanning across the islands of Oahu, Hawaii, Maui, Lanai, and Molokai.
HECO's location and isolation to the continental U.S. exposure the utility to weather- and economic-related risks.
However, the utility has a relatively diverse economy with a stable real estate market and large military presence. In
addition, Hawaii's economy is not solely dependent on the tourism industry compared with the past and the sector
accounts for only about 17% of Hawaii's state GDP, which partially mitigates the economic risks. Furthermore, the
utility has invested about $1.5 billion over the past seven years to upgrade and strengthen its infrastructure to partially
mitigate potential damages from natural disasters. Overall, we assess the company at the lower end of the range of its
business risk profile category compared to peers.

Financial Risk: Significant
We assess HECO's financial risk profile using our medial volatility table. This reflects the company's lower-risk, fully
regulated utility operations and management of regulatory risk that is consistent with peers. Under our base-case
scenario of elevated capital spending averaging about $450 million annually, dividends of about $100 million annually,
continued rate case filings, and use of constructive regulatory mechanisms, we expect HECO's financial measures will
consistently reflect the middle of the range of its financial risk profile. Specifically, we expect FFO to debt to be about

Liquidity: Adequate
HECO has adequate liquidity, in our view, and can more than cover its needs for the next 12 months even if EBITDA
declines by 10%. We expect the company's liquidity sources will exceed uses by more than 1.1x over the next 12
months, which is the minimum threshold for this liquidity assessment under our criteria. Under our stress scenario, we
do not expect the company would require access to the capital markets during that period to meet liquidity needs. Our
assessment also reflects the company's stable cash flow generation, generally prudent risk management, sound
relationships with banks, and a generally satisfactory standing in the credit markets.

Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• FFO of about $400 million;

• Long-term debt maturities of about $100 in 2020;

• Credit facility availability of about $200 million; and

• Capital spending of about $450 million; and

• Minimal cash on hand.

• Dividend payments of about $100 million.

Other Credit Considerations
Our ratings on HECO include a one-notch downward adjustment to reflect the utility's relatively small size and
exposure to weather- and economic-related risks. While the company has taken significant steps to harden its systems
and HECO's service territory remains strategically important to the U.S. as evidenced by the large military bases within
its service territory, the company's geographic isolation from the rest of the U.S. mainland and its its lack of
connectivity from the continental U.S. electric grid heightens risks for HECO compared to peers.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

HEI utilities' dependence on fossil fuel generation exposes the company to significant environmental risks with
about 70% of the net energy HEI utilities' generate or purchase coming from fossil fuel. However, the company is
slowly reducing its carbon footprint as mandated by Hawaii's RPS program where electric utility operators,
including HEI, need to achieve 100% renewable electrical energy sales by 2045. HEI utilities' RPS for year-end
2018 was about 27% compared to only about 10% in 2010, which sets the utilities on track to meet the 30% by
2020 RPS, and the company has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by about 20% compared to 2010. The
company's ability to meet these standards in a timely manner, without any meaningful detriment to its credit
profile, is essential in preserving our rating on the company.
From a social perspective, the company's high dependence on oil has led to abrupt spikes in power prices in the
past and is the main driver of the relatively high customer bills in Hawaii. As the company transitions to more
renewables and less dependence on oil, we expect this will translate to lower costs per kWh energy and less
volatility in customer bills. In addition, Hawaii is exposed to hurricanes and tropical storms that may cause service
disruption. The company has made significant efforts over the past decade to harden the grid in the form of
equipment reinforcement, pole replacement, as well as expanded tree trimming to increase reliability and safety.

Group Influence
We assess HECO as a core subsidiary of its parent, Hawaiian Electric Industries Inc. (HEI), reflecting our view that it is
highly unlikely to be sold, is integral to the overall group strategy, possesses a strong long-term commitment from
senior management, and is closely linked to the parent's name and reputation. Our issuer credit rating on HECO is in
