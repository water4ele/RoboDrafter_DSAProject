Overview
Key Strengths

Key Risks

Good position in the global technology contract manufacturing
services industry supported by global footprint and domain
expertise

Leverage of 3.0x at May 31, 2019, expected to fall to mid-2x in fiscal 2020
(ending August)

Focus on higher-margin, faster growing end markets

Meaningful customer concentration with top five customers accounting for
43% of revenues over last three quarters, as of May 31, 2019

Good track record of operating performance

Risk of negative consequences from trade actions

Expectation that Jabil can pursue its acquisition shareholder return
objectives while maintaining leverage below 3x going forward

More capital intensive than other peers in technology hardware, with large
working capital swings
Modest adjusted free operating cash flow (FOCF) to debt around 2% in fiscal
2019 on growth investments, which we expect to rebound to the 20% area in
2020

Leverage is at our downgrade threshold of 3x, but we expect it to fall to mid-2x in fiscal 2020. Leverage is at our
downgrade threshold of 3x as of May 31, 2019 because of an increase in debt to support the Johnson & Johnson (J&J)
acquisition and an increase in accounts receivable program utilization to support increased working capital from
double-digit revenue growth. We expect leverage to fall to the mid-2x area in 2020 on EBITDA growth and net debt
reduction. We expect revenue growth to slow to the low-single digits in 2020, more in line with our expectations for
the technology hardware industry, as large customer wins do not recur. This will allow the company to reduce its
receivable program utilization and reduce debt incurred for the J&J acquisition and new cloud and automotive
customers. We believe Jabil will also improve production efficiencies on new programs, allowing it to drive EBITDA
growth through margin expansion.
A 10% tariff on list 4 products would be manageable, while 25% would be disruptive and could put the rating at risk.
The risk of tariffs looms, but we believe Jabil could manage its balance sheet to preserve the 'BBB-' rating if the
proposed 10% tariff on the remaining trade with China that is currently tariff-free (i.e. list 4) were to go into effect. In
our view, this tariff action would be manageable--the Chinese currency has recently weakened 3% against the U.S.
dollar, mitigating some of the impact. Customers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), in addition to the
supply chain, would likely share the remaining impact. Jabil's margins are low, so there isn't much opportunity for
OEMs to gain concessions beyond its proportional share of profit within the supply chain, which we think would be

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

AUGUST 16, 2019 2

Jabil Inc.

manageable. In this scenario, we believe Jabil has the ability and willingness to manage its balance sheet to preserve
the 'BBB-' rating. We note that the tariff on products including smartphones and laptops that was originally proposed
to take effect on September 1 has been postponed until December 15. Tariffs of 25% on list 4 products would be more
disruptive. More customers would want to move production, which could cause execution issues for Jabil, and any
new production lines would take time to reach maximum efficiency, there could be demand destruction from price
increases to end users, and most importantly, there could be a global economic slowdown that would hurt IT
spending. This scenario could put the rating on Jabil at risk given its credit metrics that are currently near our
downgrade thresholds. We would consider the company's tariff mitigation and balance sheet management strategies,
but if we believed credit metrics were likely to exceed our downgrade thresholds over a 24-month period, we could
lower the rating.
The company has high concentration with Apple, but we expect the relationship to remain productive since Jabil is an
important supplier. Apple represented 28% of fiscal 2018 revenues, which has caused volatility in operating
performance in the past, but performance has been good over the past five years. We estimate revenue from Apple
grew in the 30% to 40% range in 2018, much higher than the mid-teens growth for Apple itself, we believe because
Jabil expanded in nonphone categories. We believe revenue from Apple is likely to decline in 2019 and 2020 following
a strong iPhone cycle in 2018 and as Apple's hardware businesses mature, but that Jabil remains an important
supplier. This dynamic combined with the company's new customer wins, will lower the company's exposure to Apple.
Adjusted FOCF was muted in fiscal 2018 and 2019 on growth-related working capital and capital expenditures; we
expect it to improve in 2020 as growth slows. We note that S&P Global Ratings' adjusted FOCF has been muted over
the last two years as a result of elevated capital expenditures and working capital increases reflecting robust annual
revenue growth around 15%. As growth slows to the low- to mid-single-digit range over the next two years as large
customer wins do not recur and as Apple's hardware growth slows, we expect this metric to return to the 15% area or
greater. We think the slower growth will enable Jabil to improve its working capital cash conversion cycle, and while
we expect net capital expenditures to remain in the $800 million area in fiscal 2020 on continued investment to
support the customer wins from 2019, we believe they should return to Jabil's depreciation level of $700 million or
lower the following year.

Jabil Inc.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our expectation that Jabil's recent business wins will enable it to deliver EBITDA
growth and that it will reduce net debt such that leverage reaches the mid-2x area in fiscal 2020, despite the
potential for some volatility because of trade or macroeconomic uncertainties, and large customer programs. We
expect revenue growth to moderate to the low-single-digit area in 2020 as large customer wins from 2019 do not
recur, which will allow it to improve production efficiencies on the new lines and improve working capital ratios,
resulting in cash flow metrics more in line with the 'BBB-' rating. In addition, the rating incorporates our
expectation that Jabil can manage acquisitions and shareholder returns while maintaining leverage below 3x.

Downside scenario
We could lower our ratings if adjusted leverage exceeds 3x on a sustained basis. In our view, this condition would
most likely be the result of pressures from disruptions from trade actions or a macroeconomic slowdown,
worse-than-expected profits from Apple because of a poor iPhone cycle, or large acquisitions. To reach this
threshold, EBITDA would need to underperform our fiscal 2020 forecast by almost 20%, or the company would
need to spend nearly $1.5 billion on acquisitions assuming a 10x purchase multiple. We could also lower the rating
if FOCF to debt were to remain below 15% on average over a multi-year period.

Upside scenario
Although unlikely over the next 12 to 24 months, we could raise the rating if Jabil moderates its acquisition
appetite and establishes enough EBITDA cushion such that we believe it can pursue its acquisition and shareholder
return objectives and absorb an operating downturn while maintaining leverage below 2x and FOCF to debt above
25% on average over a multi-year period.

Assumptions

Key Metrics

• Real global GDP growth of 3.3% in 2019 and 3.6% in
2020.

• Leverage in the high-2x area in fiscal 2019 and
mid-2x area in 2020; and

• Real U.S. GDP growth of 2.5% in 2019 and 1.8% in
2020.

• S&P Global Ratings' FOCF adjusted for equipment
sales, collection of the deferred purchase price
receivable, and receivables program utilization,
around $100 million in fiscal 2019 (2% FOCF to
debt) and in the $800 million to $1 billion range in
fiscal 2020 (around 20% FOCF to debt).

• Hardware industry revenue growth that is flat to
slightly positive.
• Jabil's revenue growth in the low- to mid-single
digits in fiscal 2020 and 2021, in line with our
macroeconomic forecast but slightly above our
industry expectations, and much slower than the
mid-teens growth during the prior two years.
• A return to historical revenue growth levels in the
low-single digits for the electronics manufacturing
segment, after two years of double-digit growth on
large new customer wins; a modest decline in Apple
revenues in 2020 followed by a rebound in 2021 on
a new iPhone cycle; a return to historical revenue
growth in the high-single digit area for the plastics,
packaging, and health care businesses following
strong double-digit growth driven by J&J.
• About 20 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion
in 2020 to 6.7% as the company optimizes large
customer wins from 2019.
• Capital expenditures net of equipment sales around
$800 million in 2020 consistent with 2019,
moderating in 2021 to Jabil's depreciation level of
$700 million.
• Annual dividend payments around $50 million.
• Working capital becomes a source of cash in 2020
following two years of usage as growth moderates,
and the company's accounts receivable program
utilization declines accordingly.
• Although we expect the company to pursue small to
midsize acquisitions that would complement its
faster growing businesses like plastics, packaging,
and health care, we do not include assumptions
about acquisitions in our forecast due to uncertainty
around timing and sizing.
• In the absence of acquisitions, we assume that the
company would use its FOCF for share buybacks.

Base-case projections
We expect revenue growth to moderate to historical levels in the low- to mid-single digits, but for margins to expand.
We expect revenue growth in the mid-teens in fiscal 2019 as a result of large wins from cloud, health care, 5G, and
automotive customers. We expect growth to moderate to historical levels in the low- to mid-single digits as these large
wins do not recur, but that margins will expand as the company optimizes production for these wins.
We expect Jabil to reestablish leverage in the mid-2x area in 2020. We expect leverage to fall to the mid-2x area in
fiscal 2020 from 3x currently on EBITDA growth from margin expansion, debt repayment, and reduction of accounts
receivable program utilization, providing roughly 20% cushion to our downside threshold.
Free cash flow improves following growth-related capital expenditure and working capital investment.FOCF has been
muted over the last two years as a result of growth-related capital expenditures and working capital increases. As
growth slows, we expect this metric to return to the 15% area or greater. We think the slower growth will enable Jabil
to improve its working capital cash conversion cycle and net capital expenditures to return to Jabil's depreciation level
of $700 million or lower in 2021.

Company Description
Jabil earned roughly $25 billion in revenues for the last 12 months (LTM) and has S&P Global Ratings' adjusted
EBITDA margin around 6.6%. It provides outsourced manufacturing and design services in two segments. The
electronics manufacturing segment (EMS, 60% of LTM revenues as of May 31, 2019) leverages its large scale and
expertise to provide highly efficient manufacturing services to traditional technology end markets (including server,
storage, networking, telecommunications, and printing) and nontraditional EMS markets such as automotive and
industrial. The diversified manufacturing segment (DMS, 40% of LTM revenues) focuses on material sciences and
serves higher-growth end markets including mobile phones, health care, and consumer packaged goods. In the EMS
segment, the company competes against large scale providers like Hon-Hai Precision Industry Co. Ltd. and Flex Ltd.,
as well as smaller players like Sanmina Corp., Benchmark Electronics Inc., Celestica Inc., and Plexus Corp. In DMS, it
competes mainly against Asian companies like Catcher Technology Co. and Quanta Computer Inc. Its largest
customers include Apple Inc., Cisco Systems Inc., LM Ericsson Telephone Co., Hewlett-Packard Co., NetApp Inc., and
Valeo S.A. The company competes on its large scale and global footprint, as well as its expertise in supply chain
management. Jabil has 43% of its long-lived assets in China as of fiscal year-end 2018, down from 48% in 2016,
compared with 32% of assets in the U.S. and Mexico combined, up from 28% in 2016. We think this reflects an
ongoing pivot away from China to North America, partly in response to trade risk and product mix changes.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
Our view of Jabil's business risk profile reflects its strategic focus on faster-growing end markets like industrial, health
care, automotive, cloud, 5G, and plastics, and packaging, and good positions in its targeted end markets. However,
contract manufacturing is highly competitive and cyclical, capital intensive (with net capital expenditures forecasted to
represent almost half of EBITDA), and has meaningful customer concentration with the top five customers
representing more than 40% of revenues.
Apple represented 28% of fiscal 2018 revenues and has caused past operating performance to be volatile, but Jabil has

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

AUGUST 16, 2019 6

Jabil Inc.

proven to be a resilient Apple supplier. For example, we estimate revenue from Apple grew in the 30% to 40% range in
fiscal 2018, much higher than the mid-teens growth for Apple itself over the same time frame, we believe because of
Jabil's expansion into nonphone categories. Also, it used to make aluminum cases for previous iPhone models, but
upon Apple's transition to glass cases, it was able to win new content and generate revenue from other nonphone
sources. We estimate revenue from Apple will drop in fiscal 2019 and 2020 following a strong iPhone cycle in 2018,
but we think Jabil remains an important supplier to Apple and that the relationship will remain strong.
The company has managed the EMS segment well, delivering 27% growth in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 due to
an increase in revenues from cloud, 5G, industrial, and automotive customers. We expect growth to moderate to the
low- to mid-single digits, consistent with its historical performance as large wins do not recur. Operating margin has
fallen to 2.7% during this time period, from 3.4% from a year ago, on new product ramps. We expect this metric to
improve as the company optimizes the production lines in 2020.

Peer comparison
Flex Ltd., Jabil's closest peer, is rated the same. Similar in revenue scale, Jabil has higher EBITDA margins because of
its higher-margin DMS segment, which includes plastics, packaging, and materials capabilities unique to Jabil, but it is
also more capital intensive even when factoring in proceeds from asset sales. Flex has better customer diversity with
no customers representing more than 10% of revenues. It has a better position in the critical automotive end market,
but Jabil's operating performance has been better over the past few years because of its large customer wins and
because of challenges in Flex's consumer segment. Currently, Jabil's leverage is higher, but we expect it to improve as
the company repays debt and reduces accounts receivable program utilization. We believe Jabil has a stronger
business than both Sanmina and Celestica because of its larger scale, and deeper and broader domain expertise.

Financial Risk: Intermediate
Jabil's financial risk profile incorporates current leverage of 3.0x that we expect to fall to the mid-2x area in fiscal 2020,
the volatile cash flow characteristics of the contract manufacturing industry, and our view that the company can
manage its acquisitions and share buybacks while maintaining leverage below 3x. We expect S&P Global Ratings'
adjusted FOCF to be low in fiscal 2019 at around $100 million, adjusted to include proceeds from equipment sales and
to back out the increase in receivable monetization programs (which run through cash flow from operations, but which
we view as a financing cash flow), on growth-related capital expenditure and working capital investments. We expect
this metric to improve to the $800 million to $1 billion range in fiscal 2020, as the company improves its working
capital cash conversion cycle, and that FOCF to debt will be around 20%.

Liquidity: Strong
In our view, Jabil has strong liquidity, with coverage of uses around 2.5x or more for the next 24 months and positive
net sources even if EBITDA declines by 30%. The 'A-3' short-term rating is a function of the 'BBB-' issuer credit rating.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Cash of $694 million as of May 31, 2019;

• Annual net capital expenditures in the range of $700
million to $800 million per year;

• Availability of approximately $1.5 billion under the
combination of its $1.8 billion revolving credit
facility due in November 2022 and $150 million
revolving credit facility due in August 2020; and
• Annual cash funds from operations around $1.3
billion.

• Current debt of $455 million and $25 million due
over the subsequent 12 months;
• Dividends of around $50 million per year; and
• Modest but volatile working capital uses.

Other Liquidity Factors
Despite quantitative metrics that could support a higher liquidity assessment, we limit our assessment to strong
because of qualitative factors. For example, we believe that in order to absorb a high-impact, low-probability event,
Jabil would likely require some refinancing. In addition, we don't believe the company has taken steps to establish
exceptional liquidity because of its acquisition and shareholder return objectives.

Debt maturities
As of May 31, 2019, Jabil's debt maturities were as follows:
• $350 million term loan due August 2020
• $400 million notes due December 2020
• $500 million notes due September 2022
• Estimated $460 million term loan due November 2022
• $300 million notes due July 2023
• $500 million notes due January 2028

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

AUGUST 16, 2019 9

Jabil Inc.

• $430 million outstanding under the combination of the company's $1.8 billion revolving credit facility due
November 2022 and $150 million revolving credit facility due August 2020

Covenant Analysis
Compliance expectations
We expect Jabil will maintain at least 30% cushion under its financial covenants.

Requirements
The company has a leverage covenant with a threshold of 4.0x, and an interest coverage covenant with a threshold of
3.0x on its bank debt.

Other Credit Considerations
The 'bbb-' anchor rating reflects Jabil's competitive and cyclical industry conditions, capital intensity, and customer
concentration, relative to other technology companies in the satisfactory business risk category.

Issue Ratings
Capital Structure
Jabil Inc.'s capital structure consists of senior unsecured debt issued at the parent level.

Analytical Conclusions
We rate Jabil's unsecured debt 'BBB-', the same as the issuer credit rating, as no significant elements of subordination
risk are present in the capital structure.
