Overview
Key strengths

Key risks

Broad scope of diagnostic testing services.

The company is subject to reimbursement risk such as the Medicare
rate cuts from the PAMA regulation.

Scale and diversity contribute to significant margin stability compared
to other health care service providers.

The laboratory industry has limited pricing power.

Superior operating efficiency

LabCorp's contract research organization, Covance, provides both business diversity and most of the
company's growth.
Currently, the company generates its growth entirely from Covance, its contract research division. We expect
Covance's mid- to high-single-digit growth to more than overcome a low-single-digit revenue decline from the
Laboratory Diagnostics business in 2019, resulting in organic growth for the company of only about 1% in 2019 and
3.5-4% in subsequent years. We project Covance to grow at mid-single-digit organic growth, boosted by growth
through acquisitions.

LabCorp is well-positioned in the competitive diagnostic laboratory business.
LabCorp, which is one of the largest diagnostics laboratory companies, is price competitive and actively invests in new
technologies and partnerships such as with Walgreens to help maintain its solid market position.

We do not expect leverage to deviate much from its current level.
We expect the company to balance the use of still-strong free cash flow between acquisitions and share repurchases.
We believe targeted acquisitions and shareholder return will remain a higher priority than reducing leverage.

Despite reimbursement risks, the laboratory diagnostics business still generates strong margins.
Although margins have been pressured by the tight reimbursement environment for lab services, such as the recent
cuts from the Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA), the company has been finding ways to lessen that downside
pressure. We expect the mid-19% operating margin for the diagnostic laboratory business to remain far higher than
that of the Covance operating margin of about 12.5%.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings (LabCorp) reflects S&P Global Ratings' view that the
laboratory reimbursement environment will remain relatively stable, and the company's substantial scale and
superior operating efficiency leave it better positioned to weather reimbursement cuts, such as the ones from
PAMA, relative to smaller laboratory services providers. It also reflects our view the company will continue to
benefit from above-GDP growth in demand for contract research services. Based on these factors, we expect
LabCorp will generate substantial free operating cash flow, but that the company will also remain acquisitive and
leverage will remain at or above 3x over the next two years.

Downside scenario
We could lower the rating if persistent reimbursement pressure or market share losses cause us to conclude that
the clinical lab business is likely to be significantly more volatile over time, which might cause us to consider
revising our view of business risk. We could also consider a lower rating if LabCorp aggressively pursues
debt-financed acquisitions, leading us to believe that it will sustain leverage above 4x for an extended period.

Upside scenario
We could consider a higher rating if LabCorp adopts more conservative financial policies. Should leverage decline
below 3x on a sustainable basis, due to more limited acquisitions and share repurchases, we could consider an
upgrade. However, given the company's strategic focus on expanding its contract research organization (CRO)
presence through acquisitions, we view this as unlikely over the next two years.

Our Base-Case Scenario

SEPTEMBER 5, 2019 3

Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings

Assumptions

• Revenue increase of only about 1% in 2019,
reflecting an expected 3% decline in the laboratory
diagnostics business, and 8% growth in the CRO
segment. We expect revenue growth in 2020 to
improve to 3.5%-4.0%, which excludes the impact of
items that hurt 2019 revenues including divestitures
and currency swings. We expect organic growth
trends in the lab business to remain below the
Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services
published 5.5% annual growth rate in health care
spending, owing to reimbursement pressures.

Company Description
Laboratory Corp. of America provides clinical laboratory services through its LabCorp Diagnostics segment, and
clinical drug development services through its Covance Drug Development segment. It is one of the two leaders in the
U.S. diagnostic testing industry, with a nationwide network of labs and patient service centers.

Business Risk: Strong
LabCorp uses its extensive menu of tests to treat and monitor an exceptionally wide range of medical conditions, and
we view this diversity favorably. Taking advantage of its large scale and scope, we believe LabCorp is a low-cost
provider with highly efficient operations. Further, in 2015 the company enhanced its business diversity with its
entrance into the contract research organization with the acquisition of Covance. Given minimal organic growth in the
diagnostic laboratory business, the CRO business has become a very important source for enterprise growth both
organically and inorganically. The company continues to enhance this segment with acquisitions including the 2017
acquisition of Chiltern, and the 2019 acquisition of the nonclinical contract research services business from Envigo.
The CRO business increases opportunities for the company's testing business and somewhat mitigates reimbursement
risk given the company's pharmaceutical company-focused customer mix.

While the company is one of two leading players in the clinical laboratory testing market, we believe it has limited
pricing power, and expect the industry will face persistent reimbursement pressure from government and commercial
payors. Although we expect typically very modest increases in average revenue per test from commercial payors, the
company will be somewhat burdened by rate reductions from Medicare through 2020 with rate cuts under PAMA. The
PAMA cuts contribute nearly 1% margin decline. While we estimate less than 10% of LabCorp's revenues are directly
exposed to PAMA reductions, we believe commercial payors may ultimately seek rate reductions consistent with
Medicare's.
Although reimbursement cuts remain a risk, we believe LabCorp's scale and superior operating efficiency leaves it
better positioned to weather adverse reimbursement changes relative to smaller peers. We think that the PAMA rate
cuts may provide opportunities for LabCorp and other large players to consolidate the market. The company's
presence in the contract research business reduces its reliance on Medicare reimbursement in particular and provides
solid mid- to high-single-digit growth.
We believe the company's scale has contributed, and will continue to contribute, to EBITDA margins that have been
very stable relative to health care services peers, reflecting the company's historical ability to offset rate cuts with cost
efficiencies and its relatively limited exposure to bad debt from uninsured (or underinsured) patients. For these
reasons, we also view LabCorp as less exposed to certain legislative developments, such as those intended to weaken
the Affordable Care Act, such as the elimination of the individual mandate, relative to other health care service
providers.

We compare LabCorp to another leading lab company, Quest Diagnostics Inc. These companies are clearly the two
largest independent lab companies in the U.S. LabCorp is larger based on total revenues, but Quest is larger than
LabCorp's diagnostic lab segment. Quest's margins are about 250 basis points higher than LabCorp, mostly due to the
impact of the lower margin produced by LabCorp's drug development segment (Covance). However LabCorp has
greater diversity, with about 38% of its revenue derived from Covance. Reimbursement risk is reasonably comparable
for both companies as both generate less than 20% revenues from government.
In general, laboratory providers have high fixed costs, giving both Quest and LabCorp a clear margin advantage
compared with all the smaller peers as they can leverage these costs more efficiently.
LabCorp has a more aggressive financial policy than Quest, resulting in higher leverage. LabCorp is more aggressive in
acquisition activity having spent over $2 billion over the past two years. Most of that spending was to enter into, and
continue to increase the size of its CRO through acquisitions. We expect Quest's leverage to remain in the 2x-3x range
while we expect LabCorp to remain in 3x-4x range.

Financial Risk: Significant
The company remains aggressive with acquisitions but has demonstrated its ability to reduce debt leverage. Adjusted
leverage, which increased to over 4x (pro forma for the 2015 acquisition of Covance) declined to the low-3x area in

Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings

2016, and has remained there. Adjusted leverage was 3.3x as of June 30, 2019. We expect LabCorp to generate about
$1 billion of annual free operating cash flow in 2019 and 2020. However, we expect the company to prioritize strategic
investments, business growth, and return of capital to shareholders over reducing leverage. Hence, we expect leverage
to remain in the low-3x area. We believe LabCorp is likely to remain a consolidator within the clinical laboratory
space, and we believe the company could also seek to bolster its CRO business through further acquisitions. For these
reasons, while we believe the company could temporarily reduce leverage below 3x in 2019, we do not believe it is
committed to permanently reducing leverage below 3x, as would be required for a higher rating.

Liquidity: Adequate
In our assessment, LabCorp's liquidity is adequate. This reflects sources of liquidity that we expect to exceed uses by
over 1.5x. We believe net sources will be positive even with a 30% decline in EBITDA. We expect the company's
covenant headroom to be greater than 15%. We arrived at the adequate liquidity assessment because we do not
believe the company could weather a high-impact, low-probability event without needing to refinance (principally due
to the relatively high proportion of short-term debt maturities) and our belief the company would likely continue the
recently reintroduced share repurchase program even under a moderate stress scenario.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• About $265 million of cash as of June 30, 2019;

• About $400 million in capital spending;

• The $1 billion revolver, with only $35 million
outstanding at June. 30, 2019; and

• About $500 million in debt maturing over the next
12 months; and

• About $1.4 billion in expected 2019 funds from
operations (FFO).

• Modest working capital usage.

Debt maturities
As of June 30, 2019
• 2019: Zero
• 2020: $1,100 million
• 2021: $850 million
• 2022: $1,277 million
• 2023: $300 million

Covenant Analysis
Compliance expectations
LabCorp must maintain total leverage below 4x. The cushion under the covenant was 15% as of June 30, 2019. There
are no step-downs and we do not expect the cushion to fall below this level.

Capital structure
LabCorp's capital structure includes senior unsecured credit facilities, senior unsecured notes, and subordinated
convertible subordinated notes. We rate the senior unsecured debt 'BBB' (the same as the issuer credit rating). The
company's convertible notes are structurally subordinated to the company's senior unsecured debt.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

For LabCorp we believe social factors are more material to the rating than environmental ones. Lab companies
provide important services that support the health care industry's ability to test for and diagnose diseases and
conditions. LabCorp also supports the important function of drug development through its CRO segment. Lab
testing is also an important diagnostic service that supports cost control efforts. These factors require strong,
sophisticated management to understand the issues and follow the appropriate strategy. LabCorp's governance has
effectively managed its aggressive financial policy, which is to use all its free cash flow for acquisitions and share
buybacks.
