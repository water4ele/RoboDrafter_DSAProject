Overview
Key strengths

Key risks

Established position among mid-market customers with products tailored for
specific applications.

Fragmented and competitive enterprise software industry
landscape with large players that have greater financial
resources, as well as numerous niche players.

Increasing recurring revenue representing 64% of total, as customers continue
to take up the company's software-as-a-service offerings.

Overweight exposure to the economically sensitive
manufacturing end market.

Low working capital and capital expenditure requirements support free
operating cash flow, which we expect to be in the $100 million-$200 million
range each year for the next two years.

High leverage of 9.4x as of April 30, 2019, which we expect to
decline to the low-9x area in fiscal 2020 (ending in April).
Acquisitive growth strategy has slowed leverage reduction.

High leverage elevates credit risk should industry dynamics or macroeconomic conditions worsen.Infor Inc. operates in
the fragmented and competitive enterprise software industry landscape with a large exposure to the economically
sensitive manufacturing end market. It also competes with players of much larger scale such as Oracle Corp. and SAP
SE, as well as smaller players with niche solutions. An unfavorable change in competitive dynamics or macroeconomic
conditions could add pressure to Infor's highly leveraged capital structure.
A continued transition to SaaS-based solutions enhances product entrenchment and revenue visibility. Infor's gradual
transition to software-as-a-service (SaaS) has progressed consistently over the past few years. The decline in license
sales has tempered double-digit growth in SaaS revenue, but we believe the quality of the revenue mix has improved
because recurring revenue has increased to 64% of the total, with more predictability and deeper customer
relationships.
Low working capital and capital spending needs support modest cash flow despite high leverage. Capital expenditures,
including capitalized software development, are typically below 3% of revenues, and cash from receivables and
payables roughly offset each other over the long term. Deferred revenue is a source of cash as the company collects
payments in advance of revenue recognition. As a result, Infor can generate modest cash flow despite high leverage.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our view that EBITDA will grow modestly over the next 12 months as Infor continues
its transition to SaaS delivery, and that expected free operating cash flow (FOCF) in the $120 million-$160 million
range (adjusted for accrued preferred dividends) will allow it to meet its debt service requirements.

Upside scenario
We could raise the rating if the company reduces leverage to the low-8x area or lower as a result of cost
reductions, continued revenue growth, or debt repayment. Infor would need to grow EBITDA by nearly 10% from
current levels and repay $300 million of debt to reach this threshold.
In January 2019, the company announced that it would target an IPO in the following 12-24 months. If it used IPO
proceeds for debt reduction such that leverage fell to the low-8x area or below, we could raise the rating. In
addition, if Koch Industries controlled the company at some point (today we view the company as being jointly
controlled by Koch and Golden Gate Capital), either as a result of the IPO or some other change in ownership
shares, and we believed that it would support Infor in times of stress, we could raise the rating by another notch.
This scenario would be consistent with what we believe are Koch's preferences to control its investments and its
willingness to support them in times of stress (Molex Electronic Technologies LLC, INVISTA Equities LLC, and
Guardian Industries Resources LLC are examples). The company has not defined its IPO strategy or the future
evolution of ownership shares so we do not incorporate either factor into our ratings; as new information emerges
regarding these factors, we will review our ratings.

Downside scenario
We could lower the rating if we come to view the company's capital structure as unsustainable, which could occur
if FOCF approaches break-even. A decline in manufacturing investment spending as a result of an macroeconomic
downturn or a loss of market share to competitors who introduce more compelling products could lead to this
condition.

Assumptions

Key Metrics

• Real global GDP growth of 3.3% in calendar 2019
and 3.6% in 2020.
• Real U.S. GDP growth of 2.5% in 2019 and 1.8% in
2020.
• Global software sector revenue growth in the
mid-single-digits annually.
• Revenue growth in the low- to mid-single-digit
percents in fiscal 2020 and 2021, in line with our
macroeconomic expectations and the company's
track record, but slightly below our industry
expectations because good growth in SaaS revenue
is partly offset by falling perpetual license sales.

Note: Fiscal year ends in April. FOCF--Free operating

reported capital spending less holdco note interest
accrual (2019) less preferred dividend accrual (2020
and 2021). A--Actual. E--Estimate.

• Perpetual license revenue declines in the mid-single
to low-double-digit percents as customers
increasingly choose SaaS products, and the
associated maintenance revenue declines in the
low-single-digits as license sales decline and as Infor
converts maintenance paying customers to SaaS.
We also expect SaaS percentage revenue growth to
fall, but that annual dollar growth should remain
consistent above $100 million per year.
• S&P Global Ratings-adjusted EBITDA margins
around 21% in fiscal 2020 and 2021, consistent with
those in 2019. Margins were in the high-20% area in
2015, but have fallen as the company has
transitioned to SaaS, which is more predictable but
carries lower gross margin than perpetual licenses,
and as it has increased product investments as a
percentage of revenue.
• We treat capitalized software development as an
operating expense because the spending is related to
customer-facing products, more akin to research and
development than capital spending, in our view.
• Capital expenditures (including capitalized software
development) in the high-2% area as a percentage of
revenues.
• We view the new $750 million preferred equity as
debt and related dividend payments as interest due
to Infor's optional redemption feature.
• We do not include assumptions about acquisitions
or shareholder returns in our forecast due to

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

AUGUST 22, 2019 4

Infor Inc.

uncertainty around timing and size, but we expect
the company to continue to pursue tuck-in
acquisitions funded from cash flow.

Base-case projections
Credit metrics should somewhat improve due to EBITDA growth, but additional improvement could come with an IPO.
We expect credit metrics to improve modestly over the next 12-24 months on EBITDA growth, but not enough to
reach our upgrade threshold of leverage in the low-8x area. However, the company could reach this level if it uses IPO
proceeds to reduce debt, but it has not announced its IPO strategy so the impact on creditworthiness is uncertain.
The transition to SaaS will continue to weigh on revenue growth. Infor continues to pursue a gradual transition to SaaS,
rather than a "big bang" approach that abruptly cuts off perpetual license sales as some peers have done. This
transition hinders revenue growth because the first year of revenue from a SaaS sale is much less than that of an
equivalent perpetual license sale, but the lifetime value of an SaaS customer is greater and revenue predictability
improves as the percentage of recurring revenue increases.
Modest cash flow supports the 'B-' rating. Cash flow is modest, particularly as a percentage of debt, but it is enough to
sustain the capital structure and support the 'B-' rating.

Company Description
With over $3 billion of annual revenues and S&P Global Ratings-adjusted EBITDA around $660 million, Infor provides
enterprise software and services mainly to small- to mid-size retail, manufacturing, and third-party logistics customers,
although it serves other end markets as well. The company offers solutions specifically designed for numerous, very
specific markets (which the company calls microverticals), which differentiates it against competitors whose products
are not as customized. Competitors include large players such as Oracle Corp. and SAP SE, as well as more niche
focused peers like Epicor Software Corp., Kronos Inc., and JDA Software Group Inc. The company reports revenues
by the following types: perpetual licenses (9% of fiscal 2019 revenues), SaaS (20%), perpetual license maintenance
(43%), and consulting (27%). It derives over 60% of revenues from the Americas, about 30% from Europe, the Middle
East, and Africa, and almost 10% from Asia Pacific.

Business Risk: Fair
Our view of Infor's business risk profile incorporates its fragmented market landscape with competitors of much larger
scale, as well as smaller players with niche solutions, and exposure to the cyclical manufacturing end markets.
However, the company has a strong position among mid-market customers with solutions tailored to specific
microverticals, it has a meaningful base of recurring revenue representing 64% of total sales, and its solutions are
embedded in its customers' operations, resulting in high customer retention. Infor is increasing its focus on promoting
its SaaS offerings--similar to other software companies as demand has grown for SaaS delivery--which increases
recurring revenue but hurts profitability as SaaS has lower gross margins than perpetual licenses. Despite the lower
profitability, gross margin dollars have increased so we view the transition favorably.

Infor Inc.

Financial Risk: Highly leveraged
Infor's financial risk profile reflects leverage of 9.4x as of April 30, 2019, which we expect to decline modestly over the
next 12 months on EBITDA growth. We expect FOCF adjusted for accrued preferred dividends in the $120
million-$160 million range, with FOCF to debt around 3% as deferred revenue from SaaS contracts contributes to cash
flow. Infor has an acquisitive growth strategy but we believe it can pursue its growth objectives within the limits of the
'B-' rating, since most are tuck-in acquisitions funded from cash flow. An upcoming IPO could improve credit metrics if
the company uses proceeds for debt reduction, but it has not yet defined its IPO strategy. We view the new $750
million preferred equity as debt and related dividend payments as interest due to Infor's optional redemption feature.

Liquidity: Adequate
In our view, Infor has adequate liquidity. We anticipate coverage of uses over 5x for the next 12 months and positive
net sources in the near term, even with a 15% decline in EBITDA.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Cash of $356 million as of April 30, 2019.

• Annual capital expenditures and capitalized software
development in the $80 million-$90 million range.

• Availability of $111 million under the company's
$120 million revolving credit facility expiring
February 2022.

• Current debt of $28 million.
• Modest working capital needs.

• Cash funds from operations around $300 million
over the next 12 months.
• Deferred revenue is likely to be a source of cash, as
subscription revenue is collected in advance of
revenue recognition.

Debt maturities
Infor's capital structure consists of the following instruments with the following current balances:
• First lien term B-6 due Feb. 1, 2022: $2.1 billion
• First lien euro term B-2 due Feb. 1, 2022: $1.1 billion
• Unsecured notes due May 15, 2022: $2.0 billion

Covenant Analysis
Compliance expectations
We believe Infor can maintain at least 15% cushion under the maximum leverage requirement of its revolving credit

Infor Inc.

facility.

Requirements
The company's revolving credit facility is subject to a maximum leverage ratio of 8.5x. Its other instruments are not
subject to financial covenants.

Issue Ratings - Recovery Analysis
Key analytical factors
• The '2' recovery rating on Infor's secured debt and the '5' recovery rating on its unsecured debt are unchanged.
• Our simulated default scenario contemplates a default in 2021, primarily as a result of greater competition from
larger rivals, coupled with weakening mid-market demand. Furthermore, a failure in services or technological
capability could lead to customer defections.
• We have valued the company as a going concern using a 7x multiple of our projected emergence EBITDA, at the
high end of the range we use for software companies.

Simulated default assumptions
• Simulated year of default: 2021
• EBITDA at emergence: $470 million
• EBITDA multiple: 7x
• The revolver is 85% drawn at default

Simplified waterfall
• Net enterprise value (after 5% administrative costs): $3.1 billion
• Valuation split (obligors/nonobligors): 60%/40%
• Value available to secured claims (collateral/noncollateral): $2.7 billion/$110 million
• Secured first-lien debt: $3.4 billion
• --Recovery expectations: 70%-90% (rounded estimate: 80%)
• Total value available to unsecured debt claims: $330 million
• Senior unsecured debt claims: $2.1 billion
• --Recovery expectations: 10%-30% (rounded estimate: 15%)

Reconciliation
Infor reported $911 million of cash adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2019 compared to $664 million of S&P Global Ratings
adjusted EBITDA. We do not add back one-time costs, change in deferred SaaS revenue, or pro forma cost savings.
We add operating lease rent but deduct capitalized software development.
