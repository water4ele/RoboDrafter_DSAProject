Key Risks

Operations under a transparent and supportive regulatory Material Brexit-related downside risks, given Gatwick's large (58% of total traffic)
framework, allowing significant flexibility to adjust charges European traffic exposure
and maximize Gatwick Airport's position as the
second-largest airport in the U.K.
Profitability reaching the levels of major European peers,
thanks to cost savings, more efficient asset deployment,
better use of retail space, and an improved offering at the
airport

Heightened traffic volume risk given weakening U.K. and continental European
economic outlooks, and Gatwick's predominantly low-cost, leisure-focused traffic.
Partially mitigating this is management's successful efforts to increase share of
long-haul flights and the high credit standing of easyJet Plc and British Airways Plc,
which account for 57% of traffic

Relatively low refinancing risk, with the next bullet
maturity (of £300 million) due in 2024.

Significant capital investment program (of about £1.1 billion) in fiscal years
2020-2024 supporting aggressive growth assumptions. However, it is uncommitted
and can be scaled down if needed

Structural enhancements that reduce the default risk of
notes issued by Gatwick Funding Ltd. (GFL) by allowing
the noteholders to take control of the business ahead of an
insolvency of Gatwick Airport Ltd. (GAL)

Increasing debt leverage to help fund high forecast distributions and capital
expenditure

Despite Gatwick's extensive preparations, we see material Brexit-related downside risks.In S&P Global Ratings' view,
short-term uncertainty regarding transport policies, and the potential for economic weakening to disrupt both the U.K.
and continental European economies under differing Brexit scenarios--including no-deal--might weigh on Gatwick's
operating and financial performance more than peers, given the airport's high (58%) share of EU-bound traffic.
Both the U.K. and EU have given repeated assurances that flights will continue post-Brexit. In our view, it is in both
parties' interests to retain air traffic. In September 2019, the U.K. and EU updated the temporary air services
agreement for a the 12-month period to Oct. 31, 2020, to allow flights between the two areas under a no-deal scenario.
However, the agreement does not allow U.K. airlines to operate intra-EU services after Brexit. Furthermore, airlines
with EU operating licenses are required to be majority owned and controlled by EU nationals, which will exclude the
U.K. after Brexit. Airlines that we rate have been preparing themselves to minimize disruptions in such a scenario.
For example, easyJet Plc, which accounts for over 40% of Gatwick's traffic, has set up a European subsidiary in Austria
that has an air operator's certificate in the EU member state. This will enable easyJet to continue to fly intra-EU routes
provided that the airline is majority owned and controlled by EU nationals. easyJet has been proactively engaging with
EU-27 member state investors and has achieved just over 50% ownership and control, and can maintain this, if
necessary, via provisions in its articles of association allowing restrictions on voting rights or forced sale by non-EU
national investors.
The uncertainty remains as to whether the U.K. and EU will reach an air services agreement before the temporary
agreement expires Oct. 31, 2020. Nevertheless, we expect both parties would at least extend the temporary agreement

SEPTEMBER 16, 2019 2

if necessary to minimize disruption to the air connectivity between the two blocs.
Despite planning and taking steps to address predictable risks, in our view, unforeseen and difficult-to-predict
developments could lead to traffic disruption, in particular under the no-deal Brexit scenario. However, we believe
disruptions would likely be short-term. Disruptions could result from operational challenges such as additional border
control requirements leading to longer queues at airports, in particular if customs resources are inadequate.
Gatwick's actions to prepare for a potential drop in passenger volumes due to flight disruptions or an economic
downturn following Brexit, have included halving its distributions (to £150 million instead of £300 million planned for
fiscal 2019), and not going ahead with its intended £300 million debt issuance. Instead, in June 2018, the management
team increased the liquidity facility (to £150 million from £100 million) and refinanced its £300 million revolving credit
facility, now terminating June 21, 2023 (with two extension options to June 21, 2024, and June 21, 2025, respectively).
In the next two years, Gatwick has also significant flexibility to reduce growth capital expenditures (capex; from a
planned £490 million over 2021-2022), having already invested £1.16 billion against the £700 million (or £100 million
annually on average) committed during the five years regulatory period.
With weaker U.K. and continental European economic outlooks, we expect shareholder financial policies will continue
constraining GFL's debt releveraging plans. For fiscal 2019 through March 31, Gatwick's traffic growth slowed to 1.6%
compared with 3.6% in fiscal 2018 and 8.1% in fiscal 2017. In our view, risks to growth include both an economic
slowdown, given the high correlation between air travel demand and the underlying economy's strength, as well as
other events that might affect traffic volumes.
Gatwick, which focuses largely on short-haul (81%) and leisure (83%) flights, remains more exposed to discretionary
customer spending than airports with more business and long haul traffic. Despite commercial arrangements with a
number of airlines, Gatwick, which receives about 80% of traffic from low-cost carriers, is exposed to carriers whose
economic positions might force them to partially or completely discontinue operations, and to other one-off events.
Although the commercial arrangements give airlines incentives to maintain and increase passenger numbers, the
airlines have no obligations to GAL to deliver a given passenger volume, provide a minimum volume of flights through
the airport, or use a particular type of aircraft.
While the near-full capacity during peak hours and continued demand by airlines seeking to secure or enhance their
position at Gatwick partially mitigate volume risk, a default by an airline could still have a negative impact on
passenger volumes. For example, British Airways' use of slots released after Monarch Airlines ceased trading in
October 2017 was lower than expected due to a delay in making them available and the use of smaller aircrafts used
for the incremental flying than Monarch's A321s. Therefore, although Monarch accounted for only 3.0% of passengers
in fiscal 2017, its failure contributed to as a slowdown in passenger volume growth in 2019. We believe there might be
more airline failures because of overcapacity in the low-cost European short-haul market. Norwegian Air Shuttle (13%
of traffic) remains highly leveraged and could be under pressure following Boeing 737 Max aircraft groundings.
Another unexpected event that disrupted traffic growth was Gatwick's runway closure in December 2018 following
drone sightings affected 164,000 passengers.
Releasing additional capacity by increasing the number of air traffic movements (ATMs) per hour and using the

Gatwick Funding Ltd.

northern (standby) runway, although this is outside of our forecast horizon, might increase exposure to volume risk, in
particular if Gatwick implements them at the same time as Heathrow's capacity expansion.
Nevertheless, we understand the releveraging plans are subject to generating required earnings. We also understand
the strategy and financial policies of GAL's shareholders are aligned and supportive of targeting a net debt-to-regulated
assets base (RAB) ratio of up to 65% by maintaining a balance between investment to support traffic growth, new
funding, and dividends.
We view Gatwick group companies as delinked from Vinci's group. In May 2019 GIP's Global Infrastructure Partners 1
(GIP I) fund and four co-shareholders (Abu Dhabi Investment Authority [7.9%], CalPERS (6.4%), Future Fund Board of
Guardians [27.2%], and National Pension Service of Korea [8.6%]) completed the sale of their combined stake, ending
the GIP-led consortium owning Gatwick since 2009, to Vinci Airports (50.01%), a subsidiary of Vinci S.A. Global
Infrastructure Management LLC, the manager of GIP 1, will continue to manage the remaining 49.99% interest in GAL.
We view Gatwick group companies as delinked from Vinci's group (see chart 1) despite the accounting approach to
fully consolidate them. While Gatwick is the largest airport in Vinci's network, its overall contribution to the group's
statement is moderate (about 6% of EBITDA). In our view, reputational risk is limited because the U.K. is not Vinci's
domestic market and there are no shared services (only best practices), because airports have independent
management. GFL's debt is nonrecourse to the parents and there is no obligation for Vinci to provide support to
Gatwick in case of stress. GIP, who has significant experience in airport industry, takes an active role in Gatwick's
governance, financial policy, and management.

Outlook

The negative outlook reflects our view of the heightened risk that our base-case forecast might not be achieved,
due to a weakening economy in the U.K. and continental Europe and potential traffic disruption associated with
Brexit. As a result, credit metrics related to the Class A debt could deteriorate.

Downside scenario
We could lower our rating on the Class A debt by one notch if we expect weighted-average ratio of funds from
operations-to-adjusted net debt (FFO-to-debt) to fall below 10%, and by more than one notch if the ratio were to
fall below 8%.
Despite flights between the U.K. and the EU making up as much as 58% of Gatwick's traffic, we see a limited risk of
a sharp volumes drop given that, under the temporary air services agreement, we expect traffic to continue even
under a no-deal scenario. However, passenger volumes might not reach expected levels due to the operating or
economic conditions being more severe than we anticipate. Financial metrics could be negatively affected if the
shareholders and management do not adequately mitigate the impact, for example by lowering their distributions
and releveraging plans, reducing operating costs, and delaying uncommitted capex.

Upside scenario
We would revise the outlook to stable if the operating and U.K. economy become more predictable, such that we
see traffic as sufficiently resilient and operating performance supports our forecast that GFL will generate
weighted-average FFO-to-debt sustainably above 10% in fiscal years 2020-2022. An outlook revision to stable
would also depend on shareholders' financial policy targeting a net debt-to-RAB ratio of up to 65% by maintaining
a balance between investment to support traffic growth, new funding, and dividends.

Company Description
GFL is a wholly owned subsidiary and debt-issuing vehicle in the ring-fenced financing group (Gatwick group
companies), which includes Ivy Holdco Ltd. and GAL, of which Gatwick is the main asset. The airport is the
second-largest in the London area, which is the most affluent area in the U.K. Its catchment area is large, covering 20
million people within a two-hour drive, or 30% of the U.K. population. Gatwick serves about 228 destinations,
including 60 long-haul, although some of the destinations are operated only periodically.
The group companies are subsidiaries of Ivy Midco Ltd. The ring-fenced group grants bondholders first-ranking
security over the security group (see chart 2).

In fiscal 2019 (to March 31), Gatwick's total reported revenues were £811 million, up over 6% from fiscal 2018, and
S&P Global Ratings-adjusted EBITDA amounts to £444 million, up 7% from fiscal 2018. The revenue base mainly
includes aeronautical revenues (53%), charged to airlines primarily for passenger facilities, take-off and landing, and
aircraft parking.
Aeronautical charges are subsidised by non-aeronautical income from retail (24% of the total), car parking (11%), and
property rental (3%), among other sources (see chart 3).

Gatwick has grown under a supportive regulatory framework
Boosting strong traffic growth (a 5.1% compound annual growth rate since fiscal 2012; see chart 4) is the supportive
regulatory framework based on commitments framework that is backed by a licence and supplemented by a
monitoring regime, which gives GAL flexibility to adjust charges.

Chart 4

Under the framework in place since 2014, rather than operating under a predetermined maximum allowable yield in
any year, GAL has agreed with the airlines a set of "commitments" endorsed by the regulator, the Civil Aviation
Authority (CAA). Under the commitments, airlines do not guarantee a minimum traffic level or revenue, but agree a
tariff and a level of service level that GAL commits to. This price level cannot be exceeded over a seven-year
commitment period (Q6; April 1, 2014-March 31, 2021). However, in any single year the aeronautical charges can
differ from the commitment level as long as the discounted revenue over the seven-year period remains lower than the
equivalent amount under the Commitment price. Over Q6 to date, GAL has actively used this option to offer discounts
for growth and slot use optimization (for example by upscaling aircraft size). If minimum volume targets are not met,
the discounts disappear. GAL's actual prices have been lower than the commitment level (growing at the RPI), and
below what the CAA considers to be the "fair price" benchmark (of RPI minus 1.6%; see chart 5). It also leaves GAL
with headroom for any tariff increase over the remainder of Q6.

This has attracted substantial traffic to Gatwick, which has been growing at above twice GDP growth on average (see
chart 6).
Chart 6

Gatwick Funding Ltd.

GAL's revenue was growing at more than 3x GDP growth rate (see chart 7).
Chart 7

Under the commitments regime, GAL retains a sole responsibility for managing its investment program and is required
to invest £700 million over the Q6 period. Including about £230 million per year in fiscal year 2020-2021, GAL will
have spent £1.6 billion over the Q6 period. The expenditure can be delayed and scaled down subject to maintaining
the average over the seven-year period.
We expect the CAA will agree to extending the regime along broadly similar terms provided service standards
continue, although it might add a service commitment of on-time performance. In its short regulatory review in 2016,
the CAA concluded that, overall, the framework is working well, noting 16% stronger traffic growth compared with
expectations and generally high levels of passenger satisfaction. In December 2018, Gatwick presented to the airlines
its commercial proposal to update the commitments and extend them to March 31, 2025. We expect that this process
will continue through the second half of 2019.

Traffic quality is improving, although it is still materially short-haul, predominantly leisure, and
EU-bound
The origin to destination (O&D) traffic, which accounts for about 95% of Gatwick's total, has historically been its
strength. O&D traffic tends to be less volatile because, rather than selecting flights according to convenience of
connections (frequency, length of layover, and flight timetables), O&D passengers simply want to reach their
destination. To reinforce stability of traffic, Gatwick is engaging in long-term relationships with airlines. Also,
management has improved the quality and resilience of traffic by attracting airlines serving long-haul destinations.
These routes are less volatile and less seasonal, and once established, they typically continue being served by an
airline. In addition, they tend to generate more passengers per air traffic movement and higher yields, while passengers
tend to spend more for retail offering as they spend more time at the airport. As technology developments have

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 16, 2019 12

Gatwick Funding Ltd.

enabled smaller narrow-bodied aircraft to fly longer distances, low-cost carriers, which generate about 80% of
Gatwick's traffic, have entered and been expanding in this segment. The number of long-haul destinations has
increased to 60 from 45 in fiscal 2013 and Gatwick now ranks sixth in Europe for the number of long-haul services
operated. Nevertheless, 81% of traffic is still short-haul, predominantly Europe-bound, and mostly leisure-focused (see
chart 8).
Chart 8

Two airlines, British Airways and easyJet, serve 57% of Gatwick's passengers (see chart 9). However, the airport's
exposure to easyJet (BBB+/Stable/--) is somewhat mitigated by the airline's leading position in the low cost segment,
with proven ability to sustain high load factors and investment-grade credit quality. Gatwick is also easyJet's largest
base. British Airways (BBB/Stable/--) is the largest airline owned by IAG and operating at Gatwick, which is likely to
benefit from its support under any foreseeable circumstances. In November 2017, IAG purchased Monarch's take-off
and landing slots and assigned them to BA.

Profitability is reaching levels similar to that of major European hubs
Profitability, measured by adjusted EBITDA margin, increased to 54.4% in fiscal 2019 from 39.8% in fiscal 2011 (see
chart 10). It is at the top of the range (30%-55%) that we view as average for transportation infrastructure companies.
It is high within the peer group and close to the level of major European hubs.

Margin growth has stemmed from the implementation of various cost-saving initiatives, predominantly staff-related,
and improved management of utility costs and maintenance. Asset deployment has also become more efficient.
Gatwick has attracted traffic and operators with larger aircraft. The number of seats per ATM increased to 191 in fiscal
2019 from 172 in fiscal 2010, and load factors to 86.3% from 78.0%, above the industry average of 82% (see charts 11
and 12).

Gatwick's redeveloped retail space has boosted non-aeronautical revenue. The new walk-through concept locates
shops along the route that passengers must take to get to the departure lounge. The airport has also increased the
choice and relevance of its retail offering as well as its food and beverage (F&B) options. Gatwick does not participate
in retailers' costs, so the proportion of revenue it receives from retailers directly improves GAL's margins. While the
terms of the contracts with retailers vary, many include a minimum revenue guarantee. Retail revenue represented
about half of the total no aeronautical revenue in fiscal 2019. GAL's retail revenues per passenger (£4.12 as of fiscal
2019) and parking revenues per passenger (£1.90) remain among the highest in Europe. In fiscal 2019, GAL's retail
revenue per passenger increased by 6.2%, despite high street retailers and F&B providers struggling with changing
consumer preferences, the growth of the online marketplace, and fading consumer sentiment. Outlets at the airport
benefit from guaranteed footfall every day of the week. Food-to-go specialist SSP Group has taken over Jamie Oliver's
three restaurants at Gatwick (which were in administration) and will continue operating them. We expect further
profitability growth thanks to increasing runway capacity to up to 60 ATMs per hour by the mid-2020s through process
improvements, optimization of commercial revenues, and cost savings through technology and automation.

Peer comparison
GAL's competitive position and profitability are weaker than Heathrow's due to Gatwick's less-favorable passenger
mix, with its primary focus on short-haul travel (81%) and exposure to family and leisure (83%) rather than business
passengers (who tend to represent higher purchasing power). Gatwick has about one-half of Heathrow's passenger
numbers and generates about a quarter of Heathrow's earnings.
Amongst European peers, size-wise, Gatwick is comparable to Aeroporti di Roma (AdR), although the latter is
operating two airports with four runways. Its main airport, Fiumicino, serves about 43 million passengers, of which
26% is long-haul traffic. Gatwick's catchment area is larger and wealthier than that of AdR, although the latter benefits
from Rome's appeal as a prominent tourism and religious destination. Before Alitalia filed for special administration in
May 2017, it represented 34% of AdR's traffic.
Gatwick serves about a third more passengers (46.4 million versus 31.1 million) than Flughafen Zurich, the largest
airport in Switzerland. Flughafen benefits from one of the wealthiest catchment areas among major airports in Europe
and has a higher share of long-haul traffic (25% versus 19%), but Gatwick has a more diversified airline mix. British
Airways and easyJet account for 57% of its flights, and are not part of the same air alliance; Swiss International
Airlines and its leisure airline, Edelweiss Air, generate 61% traffic in Zurich.
Despite having a near-monopoly on passengers traveling to and from the Republic of Ireland, daa plc handles only
about 30 million passengers through its two runways (Dublin and Cork airports). The group is highly exposed to two
airlines, Ryanair and Aer Lingus, which together represent 75% of daa's aeronautical turnover. It is also prone to higher
volatility in earnings due to the correlation between passenger traffic and the Irish economy's performance. The
aeronautical tariff reduction the Irish airports regulator imposes constrains profitability and earnings.

Financial Risk
Increasing leverage up to 65% RAB to support high forecast distributions
Our view of Gatwick's financial risk profile results from the shareholder policy of increasing the group's debt leverage,
and using debt issuance proceeds for shareholder dividends (in addition to funding capital expenditure).
Given the strong operating performance, relatively low debt leverage from the past few years, and operational
certainty from securing long-term bilateral airline contracts, shareholders have expressed an intention to increase the
company's leverage to 65% net debt-to-RAB from 51% in fiscal 2017. Although GAL could raise even more debt under
its covenants (the trigger level for dividend lockup is 70% net debt-to-RAB), we understand the shareholders set the

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 16, 2019 19

Gatwick Funding Ltd.

financial policy target 5 percentage points below that level. In the context of the traffic and economic uncertainties, we
expect the pace of re-leveraging will be slower than communicated, and scale limited to headroom to the financial
covenant increased to 8 percentage points.
We expect weaker forecast cash flow coverage ratios, although we expect the ratio of adjusted FFO-to debt to remain
above 10% in FYs 2020-2024. We understand that the dividend distribution and debt issuance plans are flexible and
the releveraging plan is conditional on meeting operating performance targets, including passenger volumes reaching
over 52 million by fiscal 2022 and GFL being able to issue debt in favourable market conditions.
It will also support high capital expenditure, which can be scaled down if needed
Under its 2019 capital investment program, GAL intends to spend £1.1 billion over 2020-2024, including about £230
million per year in fiscal years 2020-2021. It will partially fund this with debt and partially with operating cash flow.
This is partially to address the CAA's observation from its 2016 regulatory review that GAL had not sufficiently
expanded airfield capacity in response to stronger-than-expected traffic, and the capacity constraints might have
contributed to relatively poor on-time performance. Nevertheless, the forecast level of expenditure is significantly
more than required under the commitments framework and provides a significant headroom for reduction in
expenditure, if needed. The capex plan consists of relatively distinct projects to support the traffic growth. They are
aimed at improving the airport's operational resilience (resurfacing the main runway); operating efficiency (more
self-service bag drops, replacement of baggage screening equipment, automation of boarding processes); and
passenger experience. We understand the minimum required annual maintenance expenditure is about £75 million.

A financial covenant constrains releveraging capacity
GAL's debt capacity is restricted by the dividend distribution covenant set as a percentage of senior net debt to
"transfer" RAB. GAL's transfer RAB is calculated as an average of the past three years' EBITDA multiplied by 11.11x. If
the company generates lower EBITDA, GFL's leverage and distribution capacity will decrease accordingly. In fiscal
2019, the company distributed fewer dividends than planned (£150 million compared with the £300 million forecast;
see chart 13). Net debt-to-RAB was 0.57x compared with 0.64x planned, and FFO-to-debt was 12.1%.

Liquidity
Based on the reported accounts of Ivy Holdco Ltd.'s we assess the company's liquidity as adequate. This is supported
by our expectation that liquidity resources will exceed funding needs by more than 1.2x in the 12 months to June 30,
2020.
Further supporting our assessment is sufficient covenant headroom for forecast EBITDA to decline by 15% without the
company breaching coverage tests. Sources of liquidity will still exceed uses, even if forecast EBITDA declines by 15%.
While management expects to distribute amounts corresponding to new debt raised and excess operating cash less
capex and tax, we believe there is significant flexibility to lower dividends in case of weaker-than-expected earnings
generation and levels corresponding to 62% net debt-to-RAB. We incorporate the full forecast capex, although that
could be scaled down to the committed amount of about £176 million and to the absolute nondeferrable minimum of
about £75 million during the period. We believe the group could absorb high-impact, low-probability events with
limited need for refinancing, given its closest bullet maturity is only in 2024 (legal maturity in 2026). The group has
sound relationships with banks and a generally satisfactory standing in the credit markets.

Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

We anticipate the following liquidity sources over the
outlook period:

We estimate the following liquidity needs over the
same period:

• Unrestricted cash and short-term investments of
about £5 million

• Expected committed capex of approximately £175
million

• Access to about £200 million of undrawn out of £300
million revolving credit facility expiring in June 2023

• Dividend set at a level corresponding to 62% net
debt-to-RAB

• FFO of about £300 million
• £300 million of senior secured notes issued in July
2019
We do not consider as an ongoing source of liquidity
the £150 million liquidity facility available to GAL and
GFL to cover potential interest shortfalls on its debt,
because use of this facility would be a trigger event as
defined by the financial documents.

Debt maturities
GFL has relatively low refinancing risk. The next bullet maturity of £300 million is due in 2024 (see chart 14).

Structural Features
GFL's Class A debt rating incorporates a one-notch rating uplift to GAL's stand-alone credit profile (SACP), to reflect
structural features designed to increase cash-flow certainty for debtholders. GFL's structural features include:
• Restrictions on business activities, mergers, acquisitions, and business transformation. GAL can only derive a
maximum 5% of EBITDA from unregulated businesses;
• Covenants restricting dividends and other subordinated payments from the financing group if the senior net
debt-to-RAB ratio exceeds 70%, and restriction on raising further additional senior debt to a level of 70% of RAB;
• A prudent hedging policy and provisions, mitigating refinancing risk; and
• A dedicated £150 million liquidity facility sized to cover 12 months of senior interest available to the issuer, GFL,
and the borrower, GAL. The facility it entered in June 2018 covers 12 months of interest payments and senior costs
upon the appointment of an administrative receiver, and is one of the hallmark structural enhancements in the
transaction. The facility has a term of 364 days and will be extended annually; in case any liquidity provider refused
to grant an extension, the issuer is entitled to draw on the facility. Although the five-year term-out provision is
shorter than for the previous arrangement, we believe the issuer can find a suitable and timely replacement solution
over that period.
We apply our rating-to-principles approach to GFL, using our criteria "Rating Structurally Enhanced Debt Issued By

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 16, 2019 24

Gatwick Funding Ltd.

Regulated Utilities And Transportation Infrastructure Businesses" criteria, published Feb. 24, 2016. GFL does not meet
all requirements for us to rate it under our structurally enhanced debt (SED) criteria, due primarily to the higher risk of
competition and the absence of a credit remedy period, during which creditors take control of the business and
stabilize its credit quality or sell the company's shares. However, GFL benefits from the majority of the structural
enhancements listed in the SED criteria, and has additional risk-mitigating factors such as the right for creditors to step
in and appoint an administrative receiver while the business might still retain significant value.
These factors leads, in our view, to a marginal reduction in the default risk of GFL, similar to the marginal default risk
reduction from which SED senior bondholders can benefit.

Covenant Analysis
Although since 2017 the headroom to covenant levels has decreased, we understand management intends to maintain
at least 5% headroom to a senior RAR trigger event ratio (see charts 15a and 15b).

Environmental, Social, And Governance

As with most airport companies, Gatwick's highest-risk exposure relates to ensuring safety and security of flights.
While the CAA considered the disruption by drones in December 2018 as beyond the airport's control, airports
could one day face financial liabilities for these incidents, in addition to suffering damage to service quality or
reputation. We do not foresee major environmental or social risks at this stage, because Gatwick has run at
maximum capacity for a number of years. The airport reduced its carbon emissions from fuel and energy 50% in
seven years (2010-2017) and was accredited carbon neutral. It has continued operation well below annual mean air
quality limits for both nitrous oxide and particulate matter.
