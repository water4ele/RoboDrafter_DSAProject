Diversification by asset classes (office, retail, and multifamily), which
should support fairly stable cash flows.

Vacancies can have an outsized impact on portfolio operating metrics

Credit-protection measures expected to improve significantly
following the largely equity-funded acquisition of La Jolla Commons
in the second quarter of 2019.

The potential reform of Proposition 13 in California could increase
nonresidential property taxes and pressure margins, which are already
modestly weaker than those of the company’s peers due to its smaller
scale.

The acquisition of La Jolla Commons modestly improves the company's scale in our view, while maintaining
above-average asset quality. In June 2019, American Assets Trust Inc. (AAT) announced the acquisition of La Jolla
Commons, consisting of two class 'A' office towers, an entitled development land parcel, and two parking structures in
San Diego for a purchase price of $525 million (less a seller credit of approximately $11.5 million). The two office
towers were built in 2008 and 2014. One tower, with approximately 421,000 square feet, is 100% leased to LPL
Financial. The other, which has about 303,000 square feet, is 95.9% leased following the execution of a new lease with
Illumina for some of the remaining space. (Upon acquisition, it was approximately 72% leased to tenants such as U.S.
Bank National Association, Paul Hastings LLP, and Finch, Thornton & Baird LLP.) La Jolla Commons has
above-average annualized base rent (ABR) per square foot of $51.62 as of June 30, 2019. As a result of this transaction,
AAT's portfolio now consists of 28 properties with approximately $3.1 billion in undepreciated real estate assets.
However, its concentration has also increased, with over 60% of square footage in California, including 43% in San
Diego alone.

Chart 1

Credit-protection measures are expected to improve materially over the next year as the company realizes EBITDA
from the recent equity-financed acquisition of La Jolla Commons. The acquisition of La Jolla Commons was largely
funded through equity issuance ($472.6 million), along with some incremental debt. We do not expect any significant
acquisitions over the next two years. Rather, we believe AAT will focus on pre-leasing tenants for the development of
the third tower. We expect a high level of pre-leasing prior to construction and anticipate funding for future
development will be largely leverage-neutral. We expect trailing-12-month (TTM) S&P Global Ratings'-adjusted debt
to EBITDA to decline to the low-to-mid-5x area by year-end 2020, supported by EBITDA growth from the recent
acquisition, positive re-leasing spreads, and some expected debt repayment. We also expect AAT to continue to issue
a modest amount of equity if its share price were to trade at a premium to the analyst consensus of net asset value.

Outlook: Stable

The outlook on AAT is stable. We expect cash flows from AAT's portfolio of well-positioned West Coast shopping
centers, office buildings, mixed-use properties, and multifamily communities will increase over the next two years,
driven by the recent acquisition of La Jolla Commons, positive re-leasing spreads, and the completion of
redevelopment projects. We expect improvement in the company's credit-protection measures, with S&P Global
Ratings'-adjusted debt to EBITDA declining to the mid- to high-5x area in 2019, followed by additional
improvement to the low- to mid-5x area in 2020 as it generates EBITDA from La Jolla Commons. Moreover, we
see fixed-charge coverage (FCC) rising to the high-3x area over the next year as AAT pays down some outstanding
secured debt.

Upside scenario
We would consider a positive rating action if AAT continues to meaningfully build scale, such that any one tenant
vacancy would not materially affect operating metrics negatively or disrupt cash flows. We would also expect
operating performance to improve, such that same-store NOI growth returns to positive levels with occupancy and
rents continuing to outpace those of its peers. AAT's adjusted debt to EBITDA would also need to be sustained in
the mid-5x area or lower, perhaps through greater- than-expected equity issuance, with FCC in the mid-3x range or
better, which is currently in line with our projections. We believe the main factor in improving our rating on AAT
lies with the company growing its scale and reducing meaningful tenant concentration to further reduce volatility
of its cash flows and operating metrics.

Downside scenario
Although unlikely, we could consider a negative rating action if operating results deteriorate meaningfully and
compare unfavorably to those of similarly sized and rated peers for a sustained period. We would also consider
lowering the rating if the company pursues debt-financed acquisitions or development such that debt to EBITDA
rises above 7.5x or FCC declines below 2.1x on a sustained basis.

Assumptions

• U.S. real GDP growth of 2.5% in 2019 and 1.8% in
2020, with unemployment remaining in the mid- to
high-3% area, which should support steady real
estate demand;
• Same-property NOI growth of approximately 1%-2%
in 2019, improving to the 3% area in future years;
• Acquisitions of approximately $525 million in 2019
(already executed), with no significant additional
acquisitions or asset sales expected for 2019 and
2020;

• Development funding of approximately $15

development of entitled land at La Jolla Commons;
• Equity issuance of at least $500 million in 2019; and
• Approximately $55 million in maintenance capital
expenditures (capex) per year.

Base-case projections
We expect AAT to post flat to modestly positive same-property NOI growth in 2019, improving in 2020 and 2021. Thus
far in 2019, lease termination fees within office and retail have hurt AAT's operating performance. However, we expect
improvement in future quarters, supported by solid re-leasing spreads, stable occupancy, and the addition of
development and acquisitions to the same-property pool.
We expect S&P Global Ratings-adjusted debt to EBITDA to decline to the low- to mid-5x area over the next two years.
We believe that metrics could further improve based on the company's willingness to issue additional equity. We also
expect that any future development for the third tower at La Jolla Commons will be funded in a largely
leverage-neutral manner, such that credit-protection measures do not rise significantly following expected
deleveraging.

Company Description
AAT--a publicly traded real estate investment trust (REIT)--owns a small but diversified portfolio of assets consisting of
12 retail shopping centers, nine office properties, six multifamily properties, and a mixed-use property that consists of
a hotel and a retail shopping center. The company's core markets include San Diego, the San Francisco Bay area,
Portland, Seattle, and Oahu.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
AAT's operating performance has remained largely stable, with leased occupancy above 90% and positive re-leasing

AUGUST 22, 2019 5

American Assets Trust Inc.

spreads for all segments despite some volatility in same-property metrics due to the timing of lease termination fees
and tenant move-outs. In the first quarter of 2019, same-property NOI percentage growth (cash basis, excluding
redevelopment) decelerated to 0.7% (compared to 7.0% in the first quarter of 2018), largely attributable to -3.2%
growth at retail properties from lower rents upon renewal at some assets and $4.5 million in non-cash lease
termination fees in connection with the surrender of the former Sears location in Carmel Mountain Plaza. In the
second quarter of 2019, same-property NOI percentage growth (excluding redevelopment) further decelerated to
-5.1% (compared to 6.8% during the same period in 2018) due to negative growth in the office (-10%) and retail (-3.3%)
segments. However, excluding the impact of lease-termination fees, overall same-property NOI growth would have
been 1.2%, and growth at multifamily properties remained positive at 4.4%. We expect improving metrics as new
leases contribute cash rents (the former Sears space is now leased to At Home Corp.) and as
development/redevelopment projects are leased and enter the same-property pool.
Chart 2

AAT's assets are highly productive, with above-average asset quality and rents. ABR per square foot in the company's
office portfolio (45% of cash NOI for the quarter ended June 30, 2019) continues to rise, reaching $43.85 on June 30,
2019, supported by the acquisition of La Jolla Commons and solid re-leasing spreads. The company's retail assets
(30% of cash NOI) continue to boast strong ABR per leased square foot at $24.49, despite declines over the past year.
(Annualized retail ABR/sq. ft. was $25.48 in the second quarter of 2018.) The mixed-use Waikiki Beach Walk property
(11% of cash NOI) has less than 100,000 sq. ft. of retail space and a hotel with 369 units. The retail portfolio generates
an ABR of $118/sq. ft., while the top-ranked Embassy Suites hotel generates annualized revenue per available room of
$280 per day. Multifamily properties (14% of cash NOI) had average monthly base rent increase to $2,088 per leased
unit from $2,048 a year prior. The portfolio has strong embedded growth, with approximately 19% of in-place office
rents below market as of June 30, 2019, which we believe should support strong re-leasing spreads.

Despite improvement in scale following the recent acquisition, AAT remains a relatively small REIT, with just 28
properties. Moreover, the company is concentrated by tenant and geography. For the three months ended June 30,
2019, Southern and Northern California contributed 36% and 15% of cash NOI, respectively, with AAT's top-three
tenants contributing 15.1% of ABR. (LPL Holdings Inc. is the top tenant, at 8.2% of ABR.) However, lease expirations
are slightly more manageable than in previous years, with 2.6% of leases set to expire in 2019 followed by 8.9% in
2020 and 6.9% in 2021. The company also has a good track record with renewal rates, which minimizes some risk.

Peer comparison
AAT is one of our smaller rated REITs, with undepreciated real estate of $3.1 billion as of June 30, 2019. We view
ROIC, Hudson Pacific Properties, and Kilroy as close peers, given their concentration on the West Coast and focus on
office and retail, though AAT is more diversified. (HPP and Kilroy are also much larger.). Washington REIT is similarly
diversified but operates within different markets. (The company is concentrated in the D.C. area.) In our view, AAT has
above-average asset quality. Although AAT's retail portfolio is small at just 12 shopping centers, the company's retail
rents are above average for our rated strip-center REITS. (Only Federal Realty has higher rents.) Likewise, the
company's office rents continue to improve and remain above average.

Financial Risk: Intermediate
AAT's credit-protection measures have improved over the past few years, with TTM debt to EBITDA declining to 6.6x
as of June 30, 2019 (compared to a peak of 6.9x in 2017 after three largely debt-financed acquisitions). Following the
recent acquisition of La Jolla Commons, which was mainly funded with equity ($472.6 million), we expect further
improvement in credit metrics over the next two years. We project that AAT's TTM debt to EBITDA will decline to the
mid-to-high-5x area in 2019 followed by the mid- to low-5x area in 2020, with fixed-charge coverage improving to the
high 3x area or better as the company continues to pay down secured debt when due.

In January 2019, AAT entered into the second amendment to its credit agreement, extending the maturity of its term

loan A ($100 million) to Jan. 21, 2021 (subject to three one-year extension options). As a result, AAT does not have
any maturities for the remainder of 2019 and just $51 million in secured maturities in 2020, which we expect the
company will pay down when due. AAT's weighted average fixed interest rate was 4.0% on June 30, 2019, with a
weighted average maturity of 5.0 years. We expect modest improvement in these figures following the issuance on
July 30 of $150 million in private placement notes due in 2030 at 3.91%, with proceeds used to repay amounts
outstanding on the credit facility (along with general corporate purposes).

Liquidity: Adequate
In our view, AAT has adequate sources of liquidity to cover its uses over the next 12 months. The company's portfolio
is largely unencumbered. ($2.9 billion of gross assets are unencumbered as of the end of second-quarter 2019). This
provides the company with additional financial flexibility, should the need ever arise to raise capital by securing these
assets with mortgage debt.
Our assessment of the company's liquidity profile incorporates the following expectations and assumptions:
• Sources of liquidity will exceed uses by at least 1.2x or more over the next 12 months;

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

AUGUST 22, 2019 9

American Assets Trust Inc.

• Net liquidity sources will remain positive, even if forecasted EBITDA declines by 10%;
• The company will maintain sufficient covenant headroom to allow for forecasted EBITDA to decline by 10%
without breaching coverage tests;
• The company has sound relationships with its banks; and
• AAT has a generally satisfactory standing in the credit markets.

Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Unrestricted cash and equivalents of $44.8 million
on June 30, 2019;

• Principal mortgage amortization of approximately
$1 million-$2 million per year;

• $150 million in proceeds from the issuance of
private placement notes in July 2019;

• Maintenance capex of about $55 million per year;

• $255 million in capacity under the company's $350
million revolving line of credit due in January 2022,
subject to two six-month extensions at the
company's option; and

• Approximately $12 million in unfunded development
related to the Torrey Point project; and
• Common dividends of approximately $85
million-$105 million per year.

• Assumed funds from operations will total $150
million-$180 million in 2019 and 2020.

Covenant Analysis
Compliance expectations
AAT was in compliance with all applicable covenants as of June 30, 2019. We believe the company will maintain
sufficient cushion over the next 12-24 months.

Requirements
Credit facility:
• Maximum leverage ratio of 60%;
• Maximum secured leverage ratio of 40%;
• Minimum FCC ratio of 1.50x;
• Minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio of 1.75x;
• Maximum unsecured leverage ratio of 60%; and
• Maximum recourse indebtedness of 15% of total asset value.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
For investment-grade real estate companies, we typically rate the senior unsecured debt the same as the issuer credit
rating, unless the percentage of secured debt exceeds 35% of total undepreciated real estate assets (or 40% of the fair
market value of assets). As of June 30, 2019, a significant majority of AAT's properties were unencumbered.

Analytical conclusions
AAT has no publicly traded unsecured notes outstanding. AAT's ratio of secured debt to undepreciated asset base was
less than 10% as of June 30, 2019, below the threshold of 35%. Therefore, should the company issue any public
unsecured notes in the future (with a similar ratio of secured debt to total assets), they would likely be rated the same
as the issuer credit rating.
