Overview
Key Strengths

Key Risks

Over 90% of fixed fee long-term contracts, mainly with investment-grade
customers at both consolidated Boardwalk Pipelines L.P. and stand-alone Gulf
South.

Large growth capital spending program at Boardwalk, which
we expect will exceed internally generated cash flows.

Increasing contract length as new projects with long-term contracts come online at Meaningful contract expirations in 2019 and 2020, with
Boardwalk and Gulf South.
recontracted volumes expected to be at lower average rates.
Leverage in the low-1x area in 2019.

We expect no credit impact from a potential acquisition of Gulf Crossing Pipeline Co. LLC. On July 17, 2019, Gulf South
Pipeline Co. L.P. filed an application with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for permission to acquire
Gulf Crossing Pipeline Co. LLC. Like Gulf South, Gulf Crossing is a wholly owned subsidiary of Boardwalk Pipelines
L.P. The Gulf Crossing system consists of 375 miles of pipeline with average throughput of 1.4 billion cubic feet per
day (bcf/d). As of June 30, 2019, Gulf Crossing had no outstanding borrowings and a credit sublimit of $500 million
available under its revolving credit facility.
Credit metrics are improved following recent debt repayment. As of June 30, 2019, the outstanding borrowings on the
company's revolver were recently paid off by parent Boardwalk Pipeline Partners L.P., using proceeds from the
issuance of senior notes. We expect leverage at Gulf South to remain in the low-1x area.
Gulf South's growth projects strengthen its contract profile. The Coastal Bend Header project, which came online in
early 2019, adds 1.4 bcf/d of firm natural gas transportation capacity and has a weighted-average contract life of about
17 years. New growth projects are critical to Gulf South's growth as contracts roll off. In 2018, 26% of contracts
expired, and we expect 7% to roll off in 2019 and 6% in 2020. We believe that recontracted volumes could be at
significantly lower rates, especially as EBITDA for fiscal year 2018 was lower than fiscal year 2017 due to contract
renewal at lower average rates and lower revenues from storage, parking, and lending.

Outlook

The stable rating outlook on Gulf South reflects that on Boardwalk Pipeline Partners and our expectation that its
adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio will be 4.5x-5x in both 2019 and 2020. We expect Boardwalk's capital spending will
remain relatively high in 2019 as it focuses on growth projects backed by long-term contracts. While the company
still has some meaningful contract expirations in 2019 and 2020, we expect lower contracting rates to be offset by
growth projects recently put in place or that will be put in place through 2020. The largest is Coastal Bend Header,
where phase 2 was put in place in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Downside scenario
The most likely downside scenario for Gulf South would come from a downgrade of Boardwalk. We would lower
the rating on Boardwalk if the partnership's growth projects have delays or cost overruns, or it renews expiring
material contracts over the next two years at much lower rates than we expect, increasing leverage above 5.5x on
a sustained basis.

Upside scenario
We could raise the rating on Gulf South if we raise the rating on Boardwalk. We could consider a positive rating
action if Boardwalk recontracts material projects rolling off at higher than expected rates, continues to execute its
growth projects, and maintains debt to EBITDA in the low-4x area.

Our Base-Case Scenario
Assumptions

• Macroeconomic variables are not key drivers of our
forecast due to the contracted nature of Gulf South's
cash flows.
• Henry Hub natural gas prices of $2.25/million
British thermal units (mmBtu) in 2019,
$2.50/mmBtu in 2020, $2.75/mmBtu in 2021, and
$3.00/mmBtu in 2022 and beyond

2019 and 2020.

Gulf South Pipeline Co. L.P.

Base-case projections
We forecast that the partnership will generate surplus free cash flow of approximately $25 million-$35 million in 2019.
This leads to our expectation of adjusted leverage remaining in the low-1x area in 2019 and 2020.

Company Description
Gulf South is an interstate natural gas pipeline that gathers gas from the basins between Texas and Alabama and
delivers it to on- and off-system markets primarily in the South Central and Southeastern regions of the U.S.. The Gulf
South system consists of 7,190 miles of pipeline with average daily throughput of 3.1 bcf/d and 10 natural gas storage
facilities with about 113 bcf of working gas storage capacity. Gulf South is a wholly owned, operating subsidiary of
Boardwalk Pipeline Partners.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
The rating on Gulf South reflects that of its parent, Boardwalk Pipeline Partners. Over 90% of Boardwalk's revenues
are subscribed under long-term firm contracts, mainly with investment-grade customers. Roughly 80% of revenues
come from capacity reservation charges, which are independent of throughput levels. The average-weighted contract
life of Boardwalk's transportation capacity is about five years. However, we expect this average contract life to
improve as growth projects become operational over the next few years. Many of these projects are backed by a
weighted-average contract life approaching 20 years.

Chart 1

The largest of the partnership's projects is Coastal Bend Header at Gulf South, with a total estimated cost of $640
million. The project was placed in service in early 2019 and provides 1.4 bcf/d of firm natural gas transportation
service to the Freeport LNG liquefaction and export facility in Texas through construction of a 66-mile header pipeline
and expansion and modification of existing Gulf South assets. Coastal Bend Header is backed by firm agreements, with
a weighted-average contract life of about 17 years.
Additionally, Gulf South has entered into firm transportation contracts for capacity on the 42-inch pipeline from East
Texas to Perryville, La. Production in the Haynesville Basin has grown with increased rig activity in the first half of
2019. Further drilling is dependent on stronger natural gas prices.
Gulf South is exclusively a natural gas pipe and does not benefit from any company integration as it lacks other
business lines. However, Gulf South is well positioned in a region where gas demand is increasing long-term due to
expanding markets and multiple gas-fired independent power projects. Expansion projects would further solidify
volumes and cash flow.

Financial Risk: Minimal
Gulf South's stand-alone financial risk profile is stronger than that of its parent. We view Gulf South's financial risk
profile as minimal and expect debt to EBITDA to be about 1.1x in 2019 compared to 2.7x in 2018. Borrowings on the
company's revolver were paid off using proceeds from Boardwalk's notes issuance in May 2019, further decreasing
leverage.
We expect adjusted EBITDA of about $300 million in 2019, driven by volume growth relating to Coastal Bend Header
and increased activity at the Haynesville Basin. We assume that Gulf South will manage its short-term cash shortfalls
with the cash management program with Boardwalk. We do not expect Gulf South to have any debt or equity
issuances.

Liquidity
We assess Gulf South's liquidity as adequate. Liquidity sources exceed uses by about 2x over the next 12 months,
which would usually indicate a "strong" assessment. However, qualitative factors, such as the partnership's ability to
access the debt capital markets during a period of financial stress, limits our assessment at adequate.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• About $13 million cash on hand as of June 30, 2019;

• Capital spending of about $250 million over the next
12 months.

• $280 million-$290 million funds from operations
over the next 12 months; and
• As of June 30, 2019, full availability of the
company's $400 million revolving credit facility,
which matures in May 2022.

Covenant Analysis
As of June 30, 2019, Gulf South was in compliance with its debt covenants.

Compliance expectations

Requirements

We believe that Gulf South will remain in compliance
with its covenants over the next 12 months.

Boardwalk Pipelines has a revolving credit facility that
also includes Texas Gas, Gulf South, and Gulf Crossing
as borrowers. Boardwalk's revolver covenants require
the partnership and its subsidiaries to maintain a
maximum total leverage ratio of 5x, which steps up to
5.5x for the three quarters following an acquisition and
includes pro forma cash flow credit for projects under
construction.

Group Influence
The issuer credit rating on Gulf South is capped at 'BBB-', same as the rating on parent Boardwalk. Under our group
ratings methodology, we assess Gulf South as a core subsidiary of Boardwalk, reflecting our view that it is highly
unlikely to be sold, operates in lines of business that are integral to the overall group strategy, and has a strong
long-term commitment from senior management.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure

Analytical conclusions

As of June 30, 2019, Gulf South's capital structure
consists of its senior unsecured revolving credit facility
with a borrowing capacity of $400 million and $300
million 4% senior unsecured notes due in 2022.

The unsecured debt rating is 'BBB-', because there is
no structural or contractual subordination of the issues.
