More than 55% of EBITDA is derived from stable and
predictable regulated networks.

Although financial headroom in the fiscal year (FY) ending March 31, 2019, was low,
we expect increased renewable capacity to support cash flow generation from
FY2020, which will increase headroom.

Improved profitability as SSE gradually shifts the energy
generation mix toward renewables, which are largely
subsidized, and away from fossil fuels.

Returns are expected to be lower in the next regulatory periods because the
regulatory frameworks will be more challenging--for example, companies will have
less capacity to underspend their total expenditure allowance.

Strong track record in developing and operating energy
assets, which provides it with opportunities to create value
through divestments.

Relatively inflexible financial policy.

One of the largest energy companies in the U.K.

The company has announced the sale of its U.K. retail division, which has faced
political pressure and fierce competition.

SSE's FY2019 results were below expectations. U.K.-based energy utility SSE saw weaker contributions from wholesale
and retail operations in FY2019. Its results were dented by ongoing competitive pressure, losses associated with its
trading activities (energy portfolio management; EPM), the suspension of the capacity market, and lower dividends
from unconsolidated subsidiaries. Funds from operations (FFO) to debt for FY2019 was 15.2%, below our forecast of
18%-20% and down from the 23.2% in FY2018. A change in accounting standards (IFRIC 18) and a change in our
methodology for calculating ratios were also factors in the FY2019 ratios' relative weakness.
Ratios should recover in FY2020, thanks to higher contributions from the wholesale operation. The Beatrice offshore
windfarm became operational in July 2019, the new Ferrybridge Multifuel 2 site is expected to become operational in
December 2019. We also expect an improved contribution from the EPM division, after SSE took steps to improve its
trading activities, including its approach to hedging. Overall, we expect FFO to debt for FY2020 and FY2021 of
18%-20%.
SSE has entered into an agreement to sell its U.K. retail division. On Sept. 13, 2019, SSE announced an agreement to
sell its SSE Energy Services business to OVO Energy Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of OVO Group Limited, for
an enterprise value of £500 million: £400 million of cash and £100 million of loan notes. SSE will use the net cash
proceeds from the transaction to reduce net debt, while its dividend policy will remain unchanged at 80 pence (p) per
share. The company will retain some of SSE Energy Services' retail activities, specifically the supply of electricity and

SSE PLC

gas to business customers in the U.K. and residential and business customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland, and
integrated services for industrial and commercial services.
The transaction is expected to be completed in late 2019 or early 2020 and is still subject to the necessary regulatory
approvals. If completed, we expect the sale to have a marginal positive effect on SSE's overall credit quality. In
particular, we believe it will improve SSE's business risk profile because the company's focus will be on its core
regulated networks and renewables business. In addition, SSE will use the proceeds from the transaction for debt
reduction, which will have a marginal positive effect on credit ratios and partially offset the loss of cash flow.
U.K. regulated utilities are facing increased reset risk, as the 2021-2026 regulatory period approaches and the next price
control is considered. The proposed framework for RIIO-2 (which stands for revenues = incentives + innovation +
outputs) indicates that electricity and gas networks, including SSE, would see lower remuneration, a change in
indexation, and limited capacity to underspend on total expenditure allowances over the next five-year regulatory
period (for more information, see "U.K. Utilities Are Feeling the Heat," published June 14, 2019, on RatingsDirect). We
will be able to assess the extent of RIIO-2's impact on SSE's energy transmission and distribution operations once the
energy networks submit their final business plans and receive the regulator's initial assessment in 2020.
We continue to view SSE's dividend policy as inflexible. SSE is committed to increasing its dividend per share (DPS)
ratio at least in line with inflation. However, it modified its policy for FY2020, reducing full-year DPS to 80p from 97.5p
for March 2019.
SSE has a strong portfolio of predominantly energy assets, increasingly focused on regulated networks and renewables.
In FY2019, the company completed the sale of a number of assets, including 50% of the telecommunications business
for an initial £215 million and stakes in Stronelairg, Dunmaglass, and Clyde wind farms for £837 million. In our view,
this demonstrates the ongoing capability to develop, operate, and dispose of assets, and enhances capital efficiency
and flexibility.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our expectation that SSE will be able to maintain FFO to debt at about 18%, thanks to
its regulated networks' stable contribution and an increasing contribution from renewable generation.

Downside scenario
We could lower the rating on SSE if S&P Global Ratings-adjusted FFO to debt falls sustainably to significantly less
than 18%. This could occur, for example, if wholesale prices or wholesale generation materially decline from our
expectations, if SSE undertook debt-funded acquisitions or expansion, or if it earns lower returns from the
regulated subsidiaries as a result of underperformance of allowances or new regulations.

Upside scenario
An upgrade could result from a sustained improvement in credit metrics, such that our forecast of adjusted FFO to
debt improves to clearly above 20% with positive generation of free operating cash flows, stable operating
performance--especially from trading operations--and clarity on the disposal of supply activities. The target for an
upgrade would remain 23% absent the separation of the supply business.

Our Base-Case Scenario
Assumptions

• Increased contribution from SSE's renewables from
new capacity. Continued high competition in retail,
from which we expect the cash flow contribution to
stop in the short term.
• The majority of capital expenditure (capex) is
regulated or spent on renewable energy. We assume
an average capex of around £1.1 billion-£1.3 billion
per year in the next three years, focused on
extending the regulated asset base and developing
greater renewables capacity.

increase in dividends of at least the retail price index
(RPI) rate from 2021.

Base-case projections
• SSE's average FFO to debt over the next two years is around 18%-20%, compared with 15.2% in March 2019. The
recovery in the company's credit metrics is a result of the wholesale operation's increased contribution.
• Debt to EBITDA will be around 3.0x-4.0x over the next three years.
• Neutral to slightly positive cash flow after capex and dividends, although the announced asset disposal provides
flexibility.

Company Description
SSE is a listed, investor-owned energy company with generation, transmission, distribution, and supply operations in
Scotland, England, Wales, and Ireland, with S&P Global Ratings-adjusted EBITDA of around £1.8 billion as of March
2019.
SSE operates in three segments: networks, wholesale, and retail.

Networks
Under the networks segment, SSE operates the regulated lower voltage distribution of electricity in Scotland and the
South of England, regulated high voltage transmission of electricity in the North of Scotland, and a 33% stake in Scotia
Gas Networks (SGN), which operates two regulated gas-distribution networks in Scotland and the South of England.
The segment's regulated asset value (RAV) as of March 31, 2019 is £8.72 billion. In FY2019, regulated networks
contributed around 58% of the total EBITDA.

SEPTEMBER 16, 2019 4

SSE PLC

Wholesale
Under wholesale, SSE is involved in electricity generation, gas storage, EPM, and gas production. As of March 31,
2019, SSE had total installed capacity of 10.5 gigawatts (GW) and total generation output of 30,835 gigawatt-hours
(GWh). The contribution from the wholesale division accounted for 30% of EBITDA in FY2019.

Retail
SSE supplies electricity and gas to business customers in the U.K., electricity and gas to residential and businesses in
Ireland and Northern Ireland, and integrated services for industrial and commercial services. The company also
supplies electricity and gas to residential customers in the U.K. SSE has announced the sale of its U.K. supply
operation, and it accounts this business as assets held for sale.
Chart 1

Business Risk: Strong
SSE benefits from a relatively high-quality, diversified portfolio of assets, which results in stable and predictable
operating cash flows. Regulated distribution and transmission network assets in Scotland and England, and dividends
received from its now 33% ownership in SGN support about 50% of EBITDA. These networks benefit from a strong
regulatory framework and have adequate operating performance.
SSE also has a portfolio of renewable assets in the U.K. (mainly wind and hydro). This amounts to about 35% of SSE's

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 16, 2019 5

SSE PLC

total generation capacity in the U.K., and benefits from a favorable subsidy regime over the long term. SSE's energy
generation business is diversified across many plants and energy sources, which provides it with the flexibility to adapt
to changes in gas, coal, and renewables prices.

A portfolio increasingly focused on regulated networks and long-term subsidized renewables
SSE's unregulated energy generation business is diversified across several plants and energy sources. This, in our view,
provides the company with the flexibility to adapt to changes in the price of gas, coal, and renewables, and mitigates
the risk of changes to policy or regulations. We consider that SSE's renewable assets benefit from a favorable subsidy
regime that supports the stability of its unregulated revenue.
Chart 2

SSE had 2.4GW of renewable energy in 2010, and 3.8GW as of March 31, 2019, and it targets capacity of about 4.0GW
by 2020. Of SSE's 10.5GW generation capacity in Ireland and the U.K., around 11% is hydro and 22% wind (see chart
2)--and of that wind, about 19% is onshore. The company also has a combined onshore/offshore wind-development
pipeline of around 8GW. We expect profitability to improve as SSE shifts the energy generation mix toward
renewables and away from fossil fuels such as coal.
SSE has a pipeline of transmission connections that could contribute to increasing the regulated asset value (RAV) to

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 16, 2019 6

SSE PLC

around £10 billion by 2023 from £8.7 billion in March 2019.
The regulated distribution and transmission assets in Scotland and England allow for recovery of efficient operating
expenses and capex. We consider the regulatory framework in the U.K. to be strong and supportive of the industry. We
expect SSE's continued investment in the transmission network and renewables to enhance the growth of its regulated
assets and earnings.
Chart 3

Like all U.K. network operators, SSE is exposed to periodic regulatory reset risk. We believe that regulatory risk is
gradually rising, because Ofgem's review process for the next period is already underway. Ofgem has finalized the
methodology it proposes to implement for the RIIO-2 price control process. One of the main elements of the new
methodology is the reduction in the allowed cost of capital. We also note Ofgem's effort to balance the interests of
consumers and investors by introducing mechanisms to limit the potential for material outperformance or
underperformance by individual companies. As RIIO-2 will not begin until April 2021 for transmission and gas
distribution (2023 for electricity distribution), we do not have sufficient information to determine the effect on the
company's credit quality. We expect to be in a better position to do so once SSE submits its final business plans and
receives the regulator's assessment in 2020 (see chart 4).

Peer comparison
SSE's main domestic peers are Centrica and Scottish Power. Centrica has a stronger market position in retail, but does
not have any stabilizing regulated activities. As a result, we consider SSE's business risk profile stronger. To maintain
the 'BBB' rating, Centrica needs to maintain FFO to debt of 30%, compared with 18% for a 'BBB+' rating for SSE.
SSE's strongest peer is Scottish Power, whose activities include power generation, transmission, distribution, and gas
operations. Scottish Power is part of the Iberdrola group, which is the second-largest power generator and distributor
in Spain, as well as the global leader in renewables through its international subsidiaries. Iberdrola needs to maintain
FFO to debt of 18% to keep its rating at 'BBB+'.
Germany-based EnBW has a similar business risk profile to SSE. EnBW is the third-largest vertically integrated utility
in Germany. The group is principally engaged in electricity generation and trading (both about 20% of EBITDA), as
well as electricity-grid operation (about 55%). The gas activities include gas storage, gas trading, and portfolio
management, while the downstream business covers the transmission, distribution, and sale of gas. We expect the
company to achieve FFO to debt of 20% to maintain its current stand-alone credit profile of 'bbb+'.

Financial Risk: Significant
Regulated networks contribute about 55% of SSE's cash flow generation. SSE's earnings benefit from expanding
network regulated assets and generation capacity as renewables come online, as well as gas production.
SSE's results for FY2019 were below our expectations, mainly because of a weaker contribution from wholesale and
retail operations. FFO to debt for FY2019 was 15.2%, compared with our expectations of 18%-20%, and 23.2% for

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 16, 2019 9

SSE PLC

FY2018. We expect a recovery in the metrics in FY2020, thanks to a higher contribution from the wholesale operation,
which will benefit from the Beatrice offshore windfarm becoming operational in May 2019; the new Ferrybridge
Multifuel 2 site, which is expected to become operational in December 2019; and growth in the networks' contribution,
given higher allowances. Overall, we anticipate FFO to debt for FY2020 and FY2021 of 18%-20%.

Large capex program, skewed toward networks and renewables
Despite the large capex program putting a strain on the balance sheet, this is mostly directed toward extending the
transmission network and renewables and, as such, should be credit positive over the medium term. Although SSE is
generally a good operator and has a strong track record, we believe that there is some execution risk in the company's
significant capex program. This is notably true for the large projects in offshore wind farms that the company has
defined in its investment pipeline.
Of SSE's £1.5 billion capex in the 12 months to March 31, 2019, £1.2 billion was spent on networks and wholesale,
mainly within renewable generation. We assume an average capex of around £1.1 billion-£1.3 billion per year in the
next three years.
Chart 5

We view SSE's dividend policy as inflexible. Although it modified its policy for FY2020, reducing the full-year dividend
per share (DPS) to 80p from 97.5p for March 2019, SSE is committed to increasing its DPS ratio at least in line with
inflation. Furthermore, SSE returned to shareholders the majority of the proceeds from the reduction of its share in

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 16, 2019 10

SSE PLC

SGN (resulting in a £500 million share buyback in 2017). Both of these actions illustrate the company's
shareholder-friendly stance.
SSE has a scrip dividend program for which uptake is successful (for example, SSE had a 47% uptake in FY2019
interim dividend), resulting in a cash dividend that is lower than the overall dividend. However, according to the
company policy, if scrip take-up for full-year dividend exceeds 20%, it will buy back shares.

Liquidity: Adequate
The short-term rating on SSE is 'A-2'. In our view, SSE has adequate sources of liquidity to cover its needs over the 12
months from March 31, 2019. We expect that the company's sources of liquidity will exceed its uses by at least 1.2x.
We also anticipate that the company will maintain a sound relationship with banks, a good standing in credit markets,
and prudent risk management.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Unrestricted cash of about £430 million as of March

Covenant Analysis
Under the terms of its major borrowing facilities, SSE has just one financial covenant, which requires it to comply with
an interest-coverage ratio (operating profit to net interest payable of not less than 2.5x). The company maintains
significant (more than 30%) headroom under this financial covenant.

Other Credit Considerations
Our comparable rating assessment modifier is positive, to take into account:
• The business risk profile at the higher end of strong, owing to the significant contribution from stable and
predictable regulated networks enhancing cash flow predictability; and
• Our expectation that the financial risk profile will be at the higher end of the significant category (13%-23%).

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
SSE's group capital structure consists of £9.1 billion of unsecured debt as of March 31, 2019, of which £1.7 billion of
unsecured debt was issued by subsidiaries.

Analytical conclusions
We do not notch down the debt at SSE PLC, since the unsecured debt amount at subsidiaries is only 19%.

Hybrid rating and capacity
SSE fully utilized its hybrid capacity in previous reported years, up to 2018. It has limited hybrid capacity as of March
31, 2019, although we expect this to marginally increase over the next few years.
The next first hybrid call date is in September 2020 (£750 million; 3.875%). The subordinated hybrid capital securities
issued on March 16, 2017 has a first call date in September 2022.
SSE has four hybrid issues rated 'BBB-', two notches down from its stand-alone credit profile 'bbb+'--one notch for
deferral and one notch for subordination.

SSE reports under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). We make a number of adjustments to SSE's
reported figures. The main adjustments for the year ending March 31, 2019, are as follows:
• Hybrid securities: £1,169.7 million of hybrid securities reported as equity, of which we add £584.9 million to debt,
since we consider it has intermediate equity content under our criteria.
• Furthermore, £1,037 million of hybrid securities reported as debt, of which we reduce £518.5 million from debt,
since we consider it has intermediate equity content under our criteria.
• Surplus cash: We deduct from debt £526.8 million of cash that we consider unrestricted and surplus as defined by
our criteria.
• Operating leases: We add £273.4 million to debt, representing the present value of future minimum lease payments,

using a discount factor of 7%.
• Power purchase agreements: We add to debt £125.3 million, representing the present value of SSE's future
commitments using a discount factor of 7%, to which we apply a risk factor of 50%, reflecting the moderately long
position.
• Asset retirement obligations: We add to debt £628.2 million of provisions for decommissioning costs.
