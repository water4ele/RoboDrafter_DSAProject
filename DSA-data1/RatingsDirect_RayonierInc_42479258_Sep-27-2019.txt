Overview
Key Strengths

Key Risks

Consistent, above-average profitability, with EBTIDA margins of 35%-40%.

Little discretionary cash flow as a timber REIT after distributing
80% or more of available cash.

Diverse timberlands holdings across the U.S. South, Pacific Northwest, and
New Zealand, which mitigates regional economic and environmental risks
(e.g., fire, disease).

Expectation that longer-term debt leverage will likely stay in the
3.5x-4x range due to potential acquisitions and returns to
shareholders.

Lower earnings volatility than peers due to superior locations close to stable
wood and pulp end markets.

Recent earnings weakness in Pacific Northwest logs due to export
markets, exacerbated by tariffs.

Very strong levels of asset protection for lenders with debt to capitalization of
about 25% after adjusting for market value of timberlands.

Smaller revenue base, product diversity, and EBITDA compared
to larger peers such as Weyerhaeuser Co.

Rayonier is likely to remain a pure-play timberland holder and harvester.
The company derives more than two-thirds of its EBITDA from timber operations, considerably more than its peer
group. Rayonier sells nearly half of its harvest output for pulp wood, which has more stable demand and pricing.
Rayonier has a history of more stable earnings than competitors that convert logs into wood products and serve
different markets.

Rayonier's leverage has recently increased, though we expect it to remain in the current range for the
foreseeable future.
Rayonier's leverage has risen over the last four quarters to 3.5x as of June 2019 from 2.8x at September 2018. We
expect the company's leverage to remain in the 3.5x-4.0x range at the end of 2019 and 2020.

Rayonier's timberlands are geographically diverse and in close proximity to its end markets.
Rayonier's 2.6 million acres of timberlands are also geographically diversified throughout the U.S South, Pacific
Northwest, and New Zealand, well located to serve U.S. pulp and sawlog markets, export markets to China and Asia,
and a small but growing export market served from the U.S. East Coast.

Rayonier Inc.

Outlook: Stable

We expect Rayonier Inc. to continue to have favorable operating results in 2019 despite softer pricing and demand
for Pacific Northwest logs on account of weak Chinese demand. We expect Rayonier to produce adjusted EBITDA
of approximately $270 million-$290 million for fiscal 2019.
Under our base-case scenario, we project Rayonier will maintain adjusted debt to EBITDA of 3.5x-4.0 in 2019 and
2020, and maintain EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratios of more than 6x. These levels continue to support the
current rating given the strong levels of asset protection afforded by the market value of its timberland holdings
compared to debt, which equates to an adjusted debt-to-debt plus capital ratio of 25%. Despite current market
weakness, we expect debt leverage to remain below Rayonier's longer-term target range of 4.0x to 4.5x absent any
meaningful acquisitions.

Downside scenario
Although unlikely over the next 24 months, we could lower our rating if Rayonier's level of asset protection,
specifically its adjusted debt-to-capitalization ratio, materially diminished due to larger losses, asset impairments,
or larger timberlands sales to fund shareholder-friendly activities. We could also lower our rating if debt to EBITDA
exceeded 5x or if EBITDA to interest fell below 3x on a sustained basis. Such a scenario could occur due to
significantly weaker-than-expected log and lumber prices, approximately 20%-25% lower log prices than our
forecast. We believe such a drop in prices and volumes would result from a 40%-50% drop in U.S. housing starts.

Upside scenario
Although unlikely, we would consider an upgrade if Rayonier were to maintain leverage meaningfully below 3x and
funds from operations (FFO) to debt above 30% for the next 24 months, in addition to maintaining its high level of
asset protection. This could occur amid continuous and significant improvement in log prices and more robust
demand in construction and pulp wood markets, with the adoption of a more conservative financial policy by the
company.

Our Base-Case Scenario
Our forecast assumes that log volumes (particularly in the U.S. South) will improve over the previous year, mainly due
to improving U.S. housing starts and higher saw timber prices from greater demand in domestic and export markets.

Assumptions

• Harvest volumes of 6.2 million-6.3 million tons in
the company's Southern segment, 1.2 million tons in
the Pacific Northwest segment, and 2.75 million tons
in New Zealand for 2019.
• 2020 harvest volumes of 6.1 million tons in the U.S.
South, 1.3 million tons in the Pacific Northwest, and
2.6 million tons in New Zealand.
• Flat to slightly improved Southern timber pricing in
2019. For 2020, assuming U.S. housing starts
continue to number about 1.3 million, we expect
modest strengthening in Southern log pricing due to
supply constraints in other wood baskets,
particularly Canada.

• Log prices in New Zealand will remain weak, as they
were in the first half of 2019, due to continued high
log inventories and lower-cost alternative timber.

Base-case projections
• Selling, general, and administration expenses of 4%-5% of sales, in line with historical averages.
• No acquisitions assumed in our forecast.
• Real estate EBITDA of about $65 million-$70 million in each of 2019 and 2020, excluding any large dispositions.
• Approximately $140 million in dividend payments in each of 2019 and 2020, representing 70%-80% of free cash
flow.

Company Description
Rayonier is the second-largest publicly traded timberland holder after Weyerhaeuser Co. Rayonier owns or leases
approximately 2.6 million acres of timberlands located in the southern U.S. (1.81 million acres) and Pacific Northwest
(379,000 acres). It also has a 77% ownership interest in Matariki Forestry Group, a New Zealand joint venture, which
owns or leases approximately 410,000 acres (292,000 net plantable acres) of timberlands in New Zealand. The
company derives about 70% of its EBITDA from timberland operations and the remainder from real estate and trading.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
Rayonier holds a solid position as a major supplier of pulpwood and saw logs in the U.S. While it is the second-largest
timber REIT in the U.S., it is much smaller than peer Weyerhaeuser Co. in terms of timberlands (2.6 million acres
compared to 12.4 million acres for Weyerhaeuser), harvest volumes (10 million tons versus 41 million tons), and
revenues ($743 million versus $6.9 billion over the last four quarters). However, Rayonier does produce higher margins
as a pure-play timber REIT, as it does not own saw mills nor manufacture any wood products. As a result, Rayonier
has above–average EBITDA margins of about 35%-40%.
The company has diverse timberlands holdings across the major wood baskets of the southern U.S. and Pacific
Northwest--giving it access to export markets--as well as New Zealand. Its U.S. South holdings are near pulp mills,
which provides some competitive advantages because both pulp and saw log timber normally have a limited shipping
radius of less than 100 miles.
Rayonier's earnings are considerably less volatile than those of timber REITs that have sizeable exposure to cyclical
wood products (lumber, panels, and oriented strand board) like Weyerhaeuser Co. and PotlachDeltic Corp. Those

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 16, 2019 6

Rayonier Inc.

companies have historically shown wider swings in earnings than Rayonier, particularly during housing cycles or
periods of depressed lumber prices, as is currently the case. In 2018, approximately 45% of Rayonier's global harvest
(including 60% of its U.S. South region harvest) was for pulp wood, which historically has had more stable demand and
pricing than saw timber. This provides the company with a consistent revenue and earnings base.
Rayonier benefits from a low fixed-cost structure typical of timber harvesting companies, with spending largely limited
to silviculture, i.e., cultivating and maintaining the growth and health of forestlands. It also outsources harvesting
operations to third-party providers. In times of slack log demand, harvest can be deferred and forest holdings become
more valuable as tree stands continue to grow and mature into more valuable saw timber.
Rayonier also possesses significant real estate holdings that it has identified as having higher better use--specifically
around the Interstate 95 corridor in the southern U.S.--which should provide a consistent stream of real estate
development income over the next 10 years as these properties are developed or sold. This segment contributes
roughly $70 million-$100 million in annual revenues (excluding any extraordinary large dispositions) with a high
adjusted EBITDA contribution (90% or more is not unusual). We expect the company to generate $65 million to $70
million of EBITDA from this segment in 2019.

Financial Risk: Significant
Our assessment of Rayonier's financial risk reflects our view of solid asset protection and coverage ratios driven by
ownership of valuable salable timberland (for which an active market exists) with a market value of 4x-5x greater than
debt. As of June 2019, adjusted debt to capitalization was about 25%, which supports the investment-grade rating.
We expect Rayonier to maintain credit metrics in line with the rating over the next 24 months, aided by solid cash flow
generation. We project debt to EBITDA of 3.5x-4.0x and FFO to adjusted debt of 20%-25% in 2019 and 2020 (weaker
than 2018 levels), assuming the company does not finance any sizable acquisition or pay any special dividends in that
time frame. Current demand and pricing for Pacific Northwest logs are weak due to underwhelming Chinese export
markets. However, pricing and demand for Southern saw logs is stable. We expect further strengthening in demand
and prices for Southern wood fiber over the next two to three years as supply tightens due to lower harvesting in
Canada.
Rayonier's rating is supported by its healthy and consistent FFO generation of $225 million-$275 annually, more than
sufficient to meet its capital requirements and working capital needs. This, along with a strong liquidity position,
should enable the company to maintain its shareholder remuneration policies of distributing 70%-80% of free cash
flow, including meaningful dividends.

Liquidity: Strong
Our assessment of Rayonier's liquidity is strong, based on the following observations and estimates:
• An expectation that liquidity sources (including availability under the company's $200 million revolving credit
facility) should exceed uses by at least 1.5x over the next 12 months remaining above 1.0x over the subsequent
12-month period.
• An expectation that liquidity sources would continue to exceed uses, even if EBITDA were to decline by 30%.
• Sufficient covenant headroom for forecasted EBITDA to decline by 30% without the company breaching coverage
tests, and debt is at least 25% below covenant limits.
• Our expectation that the company is likely to absorb high impact, low-probability events without refinancing. Our
expectation is based on Rayonier's well-staggered maturity profile with nearest significant maturity in 2022 and
asset protection provided by $4.5 billion-$5.2 billion of timberlands.

Covenant Analysis
Compliance expectations
As of June 30, 2019, Rayonier was in compliance with its financial ratio covenants, with ample cushion. Under our
base-case scenario, the company will remain comfortably within compliance of financial ratio requirements.

Requirements
Rayonier's term loans and revolving credit facility are subject to a maximum debt-to-capital covenant of 65% and
minimum EBITDA to interest coverage of 2.5x.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
The company has minimal secured debt or obligations that would rank as having priority over its unsecured debt in a
hypothetical post-default recovery scenario.

Capital structure
As of June 30, 2019, Rayonier's capital structure consisted of the following:
• $200 million revolving credit facility (undrawn, $1.6 million in letters of credit) due in August 2020;
• $325 million senior notes due 2022;

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 16, 2019 10

Rayonier Inc.

• $350 million in term loan due 2024; and
• $300 million term loan due 2026.

Analytical conclusions
Rayonier's unsecured senior notes are rated 'BBB-', the same as the long-term issuer credit rating. Rayonier's capital
structure has no material priority debt above its unsecured debt.
