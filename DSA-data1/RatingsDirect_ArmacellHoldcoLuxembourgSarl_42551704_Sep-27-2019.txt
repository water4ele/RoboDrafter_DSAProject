Credit Highlights
Overview
Key Strengths

Key Risks

Leading position in the niche market of flexible foams for equipment and Limited scale and scope of operations, with estimated adjusted
technical insulation, with strong market shares of about 30% in Americas EBITDA of about €120 million in 2019.
and 25% in EMEA.
Strong geographic as well as end-market diversity.

Exposure to the cyclical construction and volatile oil and gas
industries, which together account for more than 50% of total
revenues.

Healthy and relatively resilient profitability, thanks to asset-light
business model, flexible cost base, and diversified end-markets.

Exceptionally high leverage in 2018 with adjusted debt to EBITDA at
8.2x, however we expect a swift deleveraging to below 6.5x in 2019
and below 6x by 2020.

Good growth potential, supported by favorable market dynamics and strategic investments
undertaken in 2018.
We expect revenue to increase by 5%-6% and approach €700 million in 2020, driven by strong market demand for
innovative products like polyethylene terephthalate (PET) foams and aerogel blankets, supplemented by bolt-on
acquisitions. PET is expected to exhibit double-digit growth with penetration opportunities in sectors such as
transportation, specialist construction, and light industrial, as well as a strong uptake in the global wind market.

Very high leverage in 2018 leading to minimal headroom under the current rating, however we view
this as exceptional.
Armacell's adjusted debt to EBITDA of 8.2x (December 2018) is much higher than our previous expectation of about
6.5x, mainly due to underperformance in 2018 amid lower sales and EBITDA. However, we expect this figure will
prove exceptional because we view the key underperformance drivers last year as non-recurring. They included high
restructuring expenses and loss of volumes related to delays in footprint optimization to improve cost structure and
new production lines (aerogel line at AJA in South Korea and PET line in Canada), as well as negative foreign
exchange effects.

We forecast swift deleveraging to below 6.5x in 2019 and below 6x by 2020.
This will stem from solid volume growth in PET and aerogel following increases in capacity, strong price increases
implemented earlier this year, and higher efficiency post footprint optimization. We also expect higher free operating
cash flow (FOCF) generation of above €25 million annually as the group returns to high cash conversion with a
normalized inventory level.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our expectation of a swift recovery of profitability and deleveraging over the next 12
months on implemented price increases, solid volume growth in EMEA, the fast-growing PET business, and cost
savings from production optimization measures. This should enable adjusted debt to EBITDA to improve to below
6.5x in 2019 and below 6.0x in 2020. However, EBITDA growth and deleveraging is much slower than we
expected. We think the leverage ratio will be at the weak end of the 5.0x-6.5x range commensurate with the rating
in the next 12 months, resulting in minimal headroom for further underperformance. We also anticipate that
Armacell will generate FOCF of above €25 million in the next 12 months and recover its EBITDA interest coverage
ratio back to above 3.5x.

Downside scenario
We could lower our rating if Armacell's EBITDA continued to decline, for example due to margin erosion or
weaker end-market demand, or a material adverse foreign-exchange impact. We could also consider a downgrade
if Armacell were to adopt a more aggressive financial policy than we expect through large debt-funded acquisitions
or distributions to shareholders. Under such a scenario, leverage would remain above 6.5x in 2019 on a
gross-adjusted basis and EBITDA interest coverage ratio below 3.5x. Rating pressure could also emerge if Armacell
failed to generate positive FOCF for a prolonged period.

Upside scenario
In our view, the potential for an upgrade is currently limited, given the group's very high leverage. However, strong
recurring free cash flows and adjusted debt to EBITDA improving to sustainably below 5.0x, combined with strong
commitments from the private equity owner to maintaining leverage at such a level, could put positive pressure on
the rating over the long run.

Assumptions

Key Metrics

In our base case, we assume:
• Revenue growth of 5%-6% in 2019 and 2020, up
from around 1.2% in 2018 (including negative
foreign exchange effects). Sales growth is supported
by price increases in advanced insulation and PET
implemented earlier this year, and higher PET and
aerogel production after start-up of new/extended
production lines.

• Adjusted EBITDA margins improving to about
18.5%-19.0% in 2019-2020 from 15.9% in 2018.
• Limited working capital outflows of about €5
million-€10 million.
• Capex of €35 million-€40 million in 2019-2020,
down from €51 million in 2018, including
investments in additional capacity for PET in China
and aerogel in South Korea.
• We expect bolt-on acquisitions of no more than €5
million in 2019 and about €20 million per year on
average thereafter, reflecting the group's growth
model of generating around 50% of growth from
acquisitions.

Base-case projections
We expect a swift recovery in profitability. This will stem from implemented price increases, efficiency gains from
footprint optimization and continuous cost control, and much lower unusual costs related to restructuring, which are
non-recurring.
Increased earnings and lower working capital outflow will lead to stronger FOCF generation. We expect Armacell's
FOCF to increase to €25 million-€30 million in 2019 and to €30 million-€40 million in 2020, supported by
strengthening EBITDA, improved working capital management amid a normalization of inventory levels following the
implementation of footprint optimization, and lower capex after large strategic investments in capacity expansion and
footprint optimization undertaken in 2018.

Company Description
Armacell is a Germany-based manufacturer of flexible foam products used in the insulation of technical equipment in
heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), plumbing, and refrigeration (Advanced Insulation, 78% of sales in
2018), as well as high-performance foams used in transportation, wind energy, sports and leisure, construction and
other industries (Engineered Foams, 22% of sales). The group generated about €610 million in revenue and about €100

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 27, 2019 5

Armacell Holdco Luxembourg Sarl

million S&P-adjusted EBITDA in 2018. Armacell was acquired by equity funds managed by Blackstone and KIRKBI
Invest S.A. in 2016.

Business Risk: Fair
Armacell's business risk reflects its leading position in the niche market of flexible foams, with strong market shares of
about 30% in Americas, 25% in EMEA and 15% in APAC.
In addition, Armacell has good growth potential driven by strong market demand for innovative products like PET
foams and aerogel blankets, supplemented by bolt-on acquisitions. PET is expected to exhibit double-digit growth
rates with penetration opportunities in sectors like transportation, construction, and industrial, as well as a strong
uptake in the global wind market. Following the acquisition of three companies in 2018--TB Concept Inc., Guangdong
De Xu Insulation Materials Co Ltd., and Guarto Guarnizioni Torino S.r.l--along with the launch of aerogel blanket
technology and additional PET facilities in Canada and China, we forecast the group's revenues will grow by 5%-6%
annually and approach about €700 million in 2020. We expect the group to benefit from global megatrends and
continue to maintain above market-average growth, due to increasingly stringent requirements and regulation for
energy efficiency and continuous substitution of traditional insulation materials.
Armacell also benefits from geographic diversity of its business, with a balanced presence in Europe, the Middle East,
and Africa (35% of group sales in 2018), the Americas (above 25%), and Asia-Pacific (nearly 20%) along with a broad
range of end-markets.

Chart 2

Armacell's business risk profile will remain supported by healthy and resilient profitability, reflected in adjusted
EBITDA margin of 18.5%-19.0% in 2019-2020, resulting from a relatively asset-light business model, flexible cost base,
and the ability to pass on the majority of raw material price fluctuations to customers, although with a time lag.
However, constraints on business risk include Armacell's relatively limited scale and scope of operations compared
with global building materials-producing peers. We forecast the group's revenues will reach about €640 million-€650
million in 2019 and its adjusted EBITDA will be above €120 million. Our assessment also reflects the group's narrow
focus in the highly fragmented equipment insulation market with limited product diversity. The business risk profile is
also constrained by the group's material exposure to the cyclical and volatile construction and oil and gas industries,
which together account for more than 50% of total revenues and resulted in underperformance in the past.

Financial Risk: Highly leveraged
Our assessment of financial risk reflects exceptionally high leverage in 2018 with adjusted debt to EBITDA at about
8.2x, to be followed by a swift deleveraging to below 6.5x in 2019 and below 6.0x by 2020.
The solid performance in the first half of 2019 supports our forecast of a swift deleveraging. In the first six months of

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 27, 2019 7

Armacell Holdco Luxembourg Sarl

2019, Armacell's revenue was 6.3% higher than last year due to implemented price increases across different
segments, sustained double-digit growth in the PET business, as well as favorable foreign exchange effects. EBITDA
was about €7 million higher than in the same period in 2018 (excluding the IFRS 16 effect), driven by higher sales,
lower freight costs, and cost savings from footprint optimization. Amid solid market fundamentals, we expect adjusted
EBITDA will increase to above €120 million-€130 million in 2019-2020, from €97 million in 2018, and adjusted
EBITDA margins will increase to 18.5%-19.0%, from 16% in 2018.
Armacell has invested about €440 million in acquisitions during the past three years, reflecting its growth model of
relying equally on organic and external expansion. We expect Armacell will continue to do bolt-on acquisitions, which
will be primarily funded through internal cash generation.
We expect the implementation of IFRS 16 will have a very limited impact on Armacell's adjusted figures, given our
estimate of only a small gap between our operating lease adjustments (€42 million to debt and €11 million to EBITDA
in 2018) and the impact of IFRS 16 as reported by the group (€41 million to debt and €6 million to EBITDA in the first
half of 2019).

Liquidity: Adequate
We view Armacell's liquidity as adequate, because we forecast that liquidity sources will comfortably exceed uses by
more than 2.5x over the next 12 months beginning July 1, 2019. The group also benefits from a long-term debt
maturity profile and will not face any substantial debt maturities until 2022 when the €100 million revolving credit
facility (RCF) becomes due. In addition, we note that the implementation of a non-recourse factoring program has
reduced net working capital and interest costs with a cash effect of about €26 million as of June 2019. However, we
cap the liquidity assessment at adequate because Armacell does not meet enough qualitative conditions for a strong
assessment.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Cash and cash equivalents of €56 million as of June
30, 2019;

• Debt maturities of about €10 million;

• About €86 million available under the €100 million
committed RCF due 2022; and
• Cash funds from operations of €75 million-€85
million.

• Annual working capital outflow of about €5
million-€10 million;
• Seasonal working capital peak of about €25 million,
which can be partly financed by the new factoring
program; and
• Capex of about €35 million-€40 million, of which
standard capex would be about 2%-2.5% of net sales
(€17 million-€19 million).

As of June 2019:
• 2019-2021: €19 million

• 2023: €622 million

Covenant Analysis
Armacell's RCF is subject to a springing total senior secured leverage covenant of 7.5x, which will be tested quarterly
when the RCF is at least 35% drawn. We anticipate that the group should be able to maintain more than 15%
headroom in the next two years.

Issue Ratings - Recovery Analysis
Key analytical factors
• The issue rating on the first-lien facilities, including a €100 million RCF due 2022 and €622 million first-lien term
loan (TL) due 2023, is 'B' and the recovery rating is '3', reflecting our expectation of average recovery (30%-50%;
rounded estimate: 50%).
• We consider the first-lien RCF and TL rank pari passu. The recovery rating on the first-lien claims is supported by
the senior secured nature of the debt and a small amount of prior-ranking debt (including local debt and real estate
financing). Pension liability amounts to about 10% of total debt claims and is excluded from the waterfall. In
addition, the recovery rating is supported by a minimum guarantor coverage test (80% for group EBITDA)
according to documentation.
• However, the recovery rating is constrained by the high level of senior debt, the asset-light nature of the business,
and the group's ability to raise additional debt through various debt baskets as permitted by the documentation.
• We understand from the documentation that there is only one springing first-lien net leverage covenant, which will
be tested quarterly when the RCF is at least 35% drawn and is set at 7.5x with no step-downs. In addition, there are
restrictions on further first-lien debt when senior secured leverage on a pro forma basis is greater than 5x.
• Our hypothetical default scenario assumes a combination of declining revenues in Europe, subdued growth in the
U.S. and emerging markets, and pricing constraints resulting from increased competition. We believe that this,
combined with unforeseen operational issues weighing on production volumes and operating margins, would result
in substantially weaker performance.
• We value Armacell as a going concern supported by its leading position in the insulation materials market, its
long-standing customer relationships, and exposure to a diverse set of end-markets.

To the extent that regulatory authorities allow a rating agency to acknowledge in one jurisdiction a rating issued in another jurisdiction for certain regulatory purposes, S&P
reserves the right to assign, withdraw or suspend such acknowledgment at any time and in its sole discretion. S&P Parties disclaim any duty whatsoever arising out of the
assignment, withdrawal or suspension of an acknowledgment as well as any liability for any damage alleged to have been suffered on account thereof.
S&P keeps certain activities of its business units separate from each other in order to preserve the independence and objectivity of their respective activities. As a result,
certain business units of S&P may have information that is not available to other S&P business units. S&P has established policies and procedures to maintain the
confidentiality of certain non-public information received in connection with each analytical process.
S&P may receive compensation for its ratings and certain analyses, normally from issuers or underwriters of securities or from obligors. S&P reserves the right to disseminate
its opinions and analyses. S&P's public ratings and analyses are made available on its Web sites, www.standardandpoors.com (free of charge), and www.ratingsdirect.com
