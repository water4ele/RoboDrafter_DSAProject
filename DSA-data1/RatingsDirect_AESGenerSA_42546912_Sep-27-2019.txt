Credit Highlights
Key Strengths
• Leading player in the power generation business in Chile with about 27% market share in terms of generation.
• Predictable cash flows given by long-term dollar-denominated contracts with built-in fuel and inflation pass-through
provisions with mostly distribution and mining companies.
• Adequate technology mix of coal, hydro, gas/diesel, and renewable plants that provides asset diversification and
operational efficiencies.
• Conservative adjusted debt level, with a projected debt to EBITDA ratio of below 2.0x for the next two years.
• Adequate liquidity and good access to banks and capital markets.

Key Risks
• Operations in riskier jurisdictions such as Argentina.
• Exposure to recontracting risk, particularly after 2024, when 8% of its contracted capacity comes due.
• Coal-based plants make up 59% of Gener's installed capacity. We see certain continuity risk over these plants in the
long term, given the government's strategy to move the energy matrix to a renewable scheme, gradually
decommissioning existing coal-based plants, starting with the oldest and least efficient ones. Under this government
plan, Gener will start by shutting down 322 megawatts (MW) between 2022 and 2024, which represent 10% of its
installed capacity in Chile.
We believe that Gener will continue to demonstrate stable cash flow generation based on its high level of contracted
capacity. AES Gener S.A. (Gener) has long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs), which have an average remaining
term of 10 years and represent 80% of Gener's revenues in Chile. The PPAs are with creditworthy counterparties
including major distribution companies, large copper mines, and industrial conglomerates. In our view, Gener's
contracted strategy will allow the company to keep generating stable EBITDA in the next three years. This is despite
the 20% lower generation Gener reported in the second quarter of 2019 versus the same period last year, which
resulted from a longer-than-expected plant maintenance in Chile, the effect of the currency depreciation and drier
hydrological conditions in Colombia, and lower electricity demand in Argentina amid economic turmoil. We

AES Gener S.A.

considered all these events as non-recurrent, and project for the next two years adjusted EBITDA between $650
million and $700 million and adjusted debt to EBITDA of 1.5x-1.8x, which is comfortably in line with the rating level.
Long-term contracts mitigate recontracting risk that comes from a cleaner business in Chile.The Chilean energy sector
is rapidly transitioning to renewables from conventional thermal energy sources. Electricity from renewable energy
sources represented just a small percent of the generation mix in Chile a few years ago; however, the share of
renewables has expanded to the high teens area today, and we expect the country's growth in renewables to continue.
Chile has an explicit target of achieving 20% of electricity from renewable sources by 2025, and above 70% for 2050.
The proliferation of renewables in Chile has caused power prices to plummet to $40 to $50/megawatt hours (MWh)
from about $100/MWh, and we view it as highly unlikely that power prices would return to the historical range. In this
new context, we expect Gener to focus on developing an ambitious renewable portfolio in Chile of more than 4,000
megawatts (MW) of installed capacity, which would allow it to transition its energy matrix into a greener one. We
expect the implementation to be subject to the closing of new PPAs at attractive margins. In the next few months, we
expect Gener to start constructing two wind farms totaling 164 MW along with a solar expansion for 80 MW, totaling
about $290 million funded with internally generated cash. The company also recently acquired 'Los Cucuros' 110 MW
wind park and 'La Cebada' substation bought from Empresas Publicas de Medellin E.S.P (EPM; not rated) for a total
amount of $138 million that Gener intends to pay with the funds from the recently announced issuance of junior
subordinated notes. We believe this strategy will alleviate some pressure, particularly related to the recontracting of
the coal-fired plants, given that mining companies (that buy almost 70% of Gener's contracted capacity) have already
expressed their preference for renewable power sources.
Chile, followed by Colombia, continues to be main EBITDA contributors. Gener operates in three countries in Latin
America: Chile, Colombia, and Argentina. We continue to believe Chile will be the main cash contributor for Gener,
with about 70% of adjusted EBITDA (as of December 2018), underpinned by the abovementioned long-term contracts.
Chile is followed by Colombia that accounts for almost 20% of Gener's total capacity, mainly through the company's
stake in AES Chivor & Cia. SCA ESP (Chivor; not rated). However, Colombia's relevance to Gener's results isn't stable
because of the specific conditions of the country's energy matrix, which is 70% hydro-based and depends on weather
conditions. Chivor aims to have about 80% of its generation contracted, which will reduce the volatile EBITDA that the
historical 50% contracted capacity used to generate.
Finally, Gener operates in Argentina through its subsidiary Termoandes S.A. (Termoandes, not rated) that marginally
contributes to EBITDA generation (about 5%). Argentina's business conditions are currently worsening, depreciating
the domestic currency, and the consequences of the sovereign's debt restructuring are affecting the domestic
economy. Nevertheless, even if Argentina's conditions negatively affect tariff settings of Termoandes, eroding its cash
flow generation or creating additional controls to cash flow repatriations, we consider that the impact to Gener will be
marginal.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our expectations that Gener will post robust credit metrics in the next two years,
including adjusted debt to EBITDA below 2.0x, even considering the development of new renewable capacity.
Additionally, the outlook incorporates our view that after the changes in Alto Maipo's contract, Gener won't need
to inject any more extraordinary
equity into this project.

Downside scenario
In the next two years, we could downgrade Gener if its net debt to EBITDA persistently exceeds 2.5x, for instance,
because of higher leverage to finance the construction of new capacity. In addition, if the company provides
additional support to Alto Maipo, our analysis would consolidate the project's debt into Gener's, which could
worsen the company's credit metrics and could prompt us to lower the ratings. Finally, if recontracting becomes
more challenging, particularly for its coal assets, we could take a negative rating action.

Upside scenario
We could raise the ratings on Gener if investments in the renewable projects occur in a timely manner, with debt to
EBITDA close to 1.5x and sustained free operating cash flow (FOCF) to debt of above 25%, while we continue to
view Alto Maipo as an independent project.

Our Base-Case Scenario
Assumptions
• Macroeconomic variables that we view as relevant for the unregulated utilities, particularly GDP growth that's
highly correlated to electricity demand. (Please see "Optimism Fades despite Fed’s Pause" published June 27, 2019)
Our forecast for Chile's GDP growth is 2.6% in 2019, 2.9% in 2020, and 3.0% afterwards, and for Colombia 2.9% in
2019 and 3.0% afterwards. GDP growth affects the volume of energy sold in the spot market (particularly in
Colombia where generation is mostly hydro-based, so it's the first to dispatch). In Chile, because spot prices are
currently low and Gener's matrix is mainly consists of coal, we don't envision a large amount of dispatch to spot
prices.
• Contract prices in Chile remaining relatively stable at $110/MWh for regulated clients and $100/MWh for
unregulated clients in the next two years. For the spot market, we consider a long-term price of $45/MWh due to
higher-than-expected generation coming online in the next two years. The spot price doesn't immediately affect the
company's revenue because most of its output is contracted at fixed prices in the next few years. However, the spot
price influences margins because Gener covers a portion of its revenue through purchases in the spot market.
Therefore, a lower spot price would increase the EBITDA margin. In the next few years, lower spot prices would
affect revenues because the contracts would be renegotiated at lower prices. The Colombian operations are
generally more volatile due to a higher exposure to the spot market. We assume average contract prices of
$64/MWh and prices in the spot market of about $50/MWh in Colombia.

• Improving, but still dry, hydrology conditions in Chile and normal ones in Colombia, and the absence of
non-recurrent disruptions in plant operations. This would lead to annual power generation close to 18,000 gigawatt
hours (GWh) between 2019 and 2021, excluding Angamos and Cochrane's power output, the shutting down of 322
MW of installed capacity in Chile following the de-carbonization process, and new installed capacity of 437 MW in
renewable projects.
• Committed equity contributions to Alto Maipo of $200 million in 2020. Capital expenditures (capex) of about $330
million in 2019 and $430 million in 2020, which excludes disbursements to the Angamos, Cochrane, and Alto Maipo
projects and includes the construction of the 303 MW of wind and solar parks, which we expect to start operating in
2021.
• We included the recently announced issuance of up to $450 million with maturity in 2079. Gener will use the
proceeds to cancel existing financial debt for about $300 million (mentioned in the previous bullet), for the financing
of the wind farm and power station it agreed to acquire from EPM, and will use the rest of the proceeds for general
corporate purposes.
• Dividend payout ratio of 100% of the previous year's net income, somewhat flexible if required.
For our analysis, we continue deconsolidating the EBITDA, debt (which we consider non-recourse debt), capex, and
cash of legally non-recourse financed projects. We take this approach because if any of these projects undergo
financial stress, we don't expect Gener to provide financial support.

Company Description
Gener is one of the largest energy producers in Chile, with about a 27% market share (by generation); a major
producer in Colombia with a 7% market share; and has one of the most efficient plants in Argentina. The company
owns a diverse portfolio of power plants in the three countries, including facilities operating on coal, gas, hydro, diesel,
solar, and biomass, with an aggregate capacity close to 5,100 MW as of June 2019.
About 70% of Gener's EBITDA comes from long-term PPAs in Chile with counterparties with solid credit quality, and
to a lesser extent, PPAs with regulated entities (mainly distribution companies). We view the contractual base as
positive from a credit standpoint, because the PPAs make Gener's EBITDA and cash flows predictable and stable. In
Colombia, the company has a higher exposure to the spot market than in Chile, where it generates about 50% of its
revenue. Finally, the company's cash flow generation in Argentina depends on a regulated market, in which tariffs are
in dollars and set by power generation and availability.
AES Gener has recourse assets, which are included in the adjusted metrics that we present in this article. The company

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 26, 2019 8

AES Gener S.A.

also has legal non-recourse projects. As mentioned, we deconsolidate EBITDA, debt, capex, and cash of these
projects. These projects are:
• Alto Maipo SpA (Alto Maipo, not rated). A hydro-electrical asset of 561 MW of installed capacity under
construction. Commercial operations date: Last quarter of 2020.
• Empresa Eléctrica Angamos SpA ((Angamos (not rated). This asset has 558 MW of installed capacity.
• Empresa Eléctrica Cochrane SpA (Cochrane, not rated). Located in the Mejillones region of Chile, it has a total
installed capacity of 550 MW.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
In our view, Gener's business risk is underpinned by long-term PPAs that mostly include mining companies in
Chile--about 70% of the contracted capacity--followed by PPAs with Chilean electricity distribution companies for 25%
of the total contracted. These agreements make cash flow generation more predictable, and any risk of early
termination would represent a weakness, since Gener's recontracting capacity may be affected by increasing
competition from cleaner energies.
Given this new context of clean energy development in Chile, Gener seeks to remain aligned with the country's
strategy while remaining competitive. Thus, the company has committed to reduce its carbon intensity and has
pledged not to build new coal plants. Gener has a long-term plan to use technological innovations to provide the
flexibility that the power system requires and incorporate more renewable energy into the energy matrix. We expect
Gener to develop an ambitious renewable portfolio in Chile of more than 4,000 MW of installed capacity. The starting
point of this strategy are the 400 MW between the recently acquired wind park and the developing of brownfield
projects that include wind parks and solar farms. We expect the strategy's implementation to continue and to be
subject to the closing of new PPAs at attractive margins that allow Gener to remain competitive in the Chilean power
market.
Gener's Colombian subsidiary, Chivor, has 1,020 MW of hydro installed capacity. In Colombia, because the energy
matrix is 70% hydro-based and is affected by rainy and drought seasons that influence electricity spot prices and
contract tenors, the duration of PPAs there average only two to three years. As a result, Chivor sells a considerable
portion of electricity in the volatile spot market. In order to avoid unpredictability from hydrological conditions, ensure
a long-term EBITDA margin of 50%, and maintain some exposure to the spot market as a hedge, Gener signed an 876
GW per year PPA with Gensa (not rated) in Colombia. This 15-year supply contract begins in 2023 and represents an
extraordinary contract considering local market conditions.
We expect Gener's Chilean and Colombian operations to be highly significant for the company's profitability in the
next few years, with operations in the two countries posting an adjusted EBITDA margin between 25% and 27%. We
don't consider Argentine operations as a key business for Gener, and expect Argentina to continue representing a
marginal portion of Gener's profitability under the country's uncertain economic conditions.
We forecast that adjusted EBITDA will range between $650 million and $700 million in the next three years. In our

AES Gener S.A.

view, last year's EBITDA was an extraordinary situation in which some one-off events boosted Gener's results. These
extraordinary episodes included positive results from Colombia due to an increase in some PPA prices and enhanced
generation that resulted from more favorable hydrology conditions, an increase in the power price in Argentina, and
higher margins given lower fuel costs. From Chile, the higher EBITDA was thanks to higher margins from the supply of
previously executed contracts and minor fixed costs associated with a restructuring plan and scheduled maintenance.

Peer comparison
As peers for Gener, we selected other Latin American companies in the power generation segment, such as Colbun
S.A. (3,884 MW of installed capacity; BBB/Stable/--), Engie Energia Chile S.A. (Engie; 2,346 MW of installed capacity;
BBB/Stable/--) and Enel Americas S.A. (BBB/Stable/--), located in Chile. In addition, we also consider as peers Isagen
S.A. E.S.P. (3,003 MW of installed capacity; BBB-/Stable/--) in Colombia and Nautilus Inkia Holdings LLC (1,618 MW
of installed capacity; BB/Stable/--) in Peru.
From a business perspective, the main characteristics all the peer companies shares is that they own and operate a
portfolio of assets rather than a single one, are vertically integrated, and participate in the generation and transmission
businesses in more than one country in most cases. Enel Americas is the only entity among selected peers that
operates in Brazil, that currently has a non-investment grade rating. In addition, all of these peers have satisfactory
business profiles reflecting certain country risks, adequate competitive position scores that reflect generally solid
records of regulation, good competitive positions, and geographic and asset diversity.
From a financial perspective, Gener compares well with Colbun, Engie, and Enel Americas given that we expect all of
those to post adjusted debt to EBITDA below 2.5x in the next two to three years. However, AES Gener, Colbun, and
Engie are focusing investments for the upcoming years in their generation businesses, mainly by developing new
renewable capacity, whereas we expect Enel Americas will devote most of its resources to the distribution business
that is by nature more stable and predictable.

AES Gener S.A.

However, because most of these new projects have started operating and because Gener has been executing a
deleveraging strategy since 2017, its main adjusted credit metrics have improved in the past two years. The deleverage
strategy included selling non-strategic assets such as Sociedad Electrica Santiago (not rated) and a portion of its
transmission business, plus refinancing debt, such as the hybrid bond issued in March this year, in more convenient
cost conditions.
Moreover, the company has recently announced the issuance of new junior subordinated notes for up to $450 million
that it will use to cancel existing financial debt for about $300 million, to finance the wind farm and power station it
agreed to acquire from EPM, and for general corporate purposes. We categorize the proposed notes as having minimal
equity content because they're subordinated in liquidation to all of AES Gener's senior debt obligations, can't be called
for at least five years, and are not subject to features that could discourage or materially delay deferral. Even though
the proposed issuance's terms and conditions are substantially similar to the existing $550 million hybrid bond the
company issued in March, which we assess as having intermediate equity content, Gener's adjusted capitalization
already reached our maximum threshold for hybrid instruments of 15%. As such, we assess the proposed notes as
having minimal equity content, meaning they will be treated as financial debt in full. However, if in the following years,
we observe that adjusted capitalization improves, for instance with the incorporation of additional assets under the
expansionary renewable plan that the company is developing, we could revise the equity content of the new
subordinated issuance. Our analysis of Gener's adjusted senior debt excludes the project financing debt of Alto Maipo,
Angamos, and Cochrane because we don't envision financial support from Gener to these entities in case of financial
distress.
In this context, and even assuming some additional debt to finance the new renewable capacity, we expect Gener to
post a conservative adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio below 2.0x. Nevertheless, we anticipate the FOCF-to-debt ratio
could be somewhat volatile given the capex plan, which will be about $380 million in 2019 and $430 million in 2020.

Adjusted ratios:

Liquidity: Adequate
We assess Gener's liquidity as adequate because its ratio of sources over uses of funds will exceed 1.2x in the next 12
months, and the sources of cash would remain higher than its uses even if EBITDA were to decline by 15%. In
addition, we incorporate the company's solid financial flexibility and access
to capital markets, as seen in the pool of loans currently in its portfolio and the uncommitted and committed credit
facilities.
Principal Liquidity Sources:

Principal Liquidity Uses:

• Cash balance of $86.2 million as of June 30, 2019
(excluding the cash held at Angamos, Cochrane, and
Alto Maipo);

• Short-term maturities of $79 million on a recourse
basis;

• A long-term committed bank line of $250 million
due 2021; and
• Funds from operations of approximately $400
million in the next 12 months (excluding
nonrecourse projects).

• Maintenance capex approaching $100 million;
• Working capital outflows of about $75 million; and
• Dividends of $270 million that represent 100% of the
expected net income for the next 12 months, which
Gener will pay in 2020.
In our view, because Gener will use the funds from the
expected issuance mostly to cancel existing debt and
finance the acquisition of EPM's renewable assets, we
see it as neutral for the liquidity analysis.

Debt maturities
Chart 5

Covenant Analysis
As of June 30, 2019, Gener was in compliance with its financial covenants on its local bonds (maximum net leverage of
1.2x, excluding non-recourse debt; minimum interest coverage of 2.5x; and minimum net worth of $1.575 billion), and
we expect a cushion of about 30%.

Group Influence
U.S.-based The AES Corp. (BB+/Stable/--), which we rate one notch below Gener, indirectly owns 66.7% of the
company. The remaining stake is floating.
Structural protections and enhancements for Gener, along with certain legal insulation features provided by Chilean
bankruptcy laws, allow for the current rating discrepancy. Specifically, under the company's bylaws, Gener can't make
loans to its shareholders. In addition, the company can distribute dividends in excess of $160 million annually (a
maximum quarterly dividend of $40 million) only if it keeps an investment-grade credit rating from two rating
agencies. If the rating drops to a speculative level, Gener can distribute dividends of up to $160 million annually only if
its FFO interest coverage exceeds 2.4x. Therefore, we view Gener as an insulated subsidiary.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
The 'BB' issue-level ratings on the existing and proposed junior subordinated notes reflect their subordinated nature to
the senior debt (senior only to the common shares) and to all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt
and other liabilities of the company's operating subsidiaries. The ratings also reflect the embedded interest deferral
feature, which is at the sole discretion of the company's management, and unpaid interest is capitalized.
