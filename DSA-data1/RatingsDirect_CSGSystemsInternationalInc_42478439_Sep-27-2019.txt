Credit Highlights
Overview
Key strengths

Key risks

Strong market share within the North American cable and satellite
markets.

High degree of customer and sector concentration.

Largely recurring revenue base under long-term contracts.

Possible large acquisitions or investments to adapt to the evolving
telecommunications industry.

Strong liquidity.
Sizable leverage headroom, as the 'BB+' rating incorporates the ability to
increase leverage to the high-2x area.

More than 50% of the company's revenues comes from three key customers. CSG Systems International Inc. generates
most of its revenue from long-term North American cable and direct broadcast satellite contracts, which average three
to five years. The company has revenue concentration with three key customers; Comcast Corp.(23%), Charter
Communications Inc.(20%), and DISH Network Corp.(<10%). We believe this customer concentration leaves CSG
vulnerable to price concessions or service cutbacks by customers when contracts are renewed. The company could
also be vulnerable to further consolidation among its customers, as companies gradually migrate to one billing
platform. However, cable industry concentration makes this unlikely unless regulatory restrictions are loosened, as
Comcast and Charter account for about 85% of U.S. cable broadband subscribers.

CSG Systems International Inc.

The company has sizable leverage headroom at the 'BB+' rating level. Adjusted leverage was 1.5x as of June 30, 2019,
which is well within the thresholds that we've set for the 'BB+' rating. We expect leverage to decline to 1x or less by
2020. While normally this low level of debt would result in a higher credit rating, our assessment of financial policy has
a one-notch negative impact on the rating. CSG has been acquisitive, and we believe that any debt-financed
acquisitions could result in more debt than is in our base case, with leverage increasing to 1.5x to 2.5x.

Outlook: Stable

S&P Global Ratings' outlook on CSG is stable. Under our base-case scenario, we believe CSG's revenues will
continue to grow at a low-single-digit percent organic rate for the foreseeable future. Absent debt-financed
acquisitions, we expect the company to continue maintaining adjusted leverage, net of cash, of less than 1.5x, and
strong liquidity given CSG's steady free operating cash flow (FOCF).

Downside scenario
We could lower the rating if adjusted leverage is sustained in the high-2x area or greater, which would most likely
happen because of significant debt-financed acquisitions or increased shareholder returns. We could also lower the
rating if CSG lost a major customer or was seriously hurt by further cable consolidation—although we see the latter
possibility as less likely given the current regulatory views of the Federal Communications Commission.

Upside scenario
We do not view an upgrade as likely over the next year given the potential for higher leverage to support an
acquisition or more shareholder returns. An upgrade would require sustained recovery and improving trends in
profitability, continued customer and geographic diversification, and evidence of sustainable growth for the
company's cable and satellite TV customers. An upgrade would also entail the company maintaining fully adjusted
leverage of less than 1.5x.

Our Base-Case Scenario
Our base-case scenario is based upon U.S. economic strength continuing for the near term, with GDP growth of 2.2%
in 2019, and 1.7% in 2020 and 2021. We do not expect the economy to have a major impact on CSG's financial
performance over the next few years, as operating performance is tied more closely to contract terms with key
customers.

Assumptions

• Low-teen percent organic revenue growth in 2019
due to 2%-3% growth in cloud solutions and the first
full-year contributions from the Business Ink and
Forte Payment acquisitions. Revenues will grow
despite declines in CSG's software and services
segment. That decline reflects the transition of
historical software and services revenues to the
managed services revenue category, which is now in
the Cloud and related solutions revenue category.
• Revenue growth in 2020 to normalize to 2%-3%.
• Cost growth will match revenue growth.

Company Description
CSG provides business support solutions (BSS) to the communications industry, including three of the four largest U.S.
video operators (Comcast Corp., Charter Communications Inc., and DISH Network Corp.). While CSG's heritage is in
serving the communications markets, the company has expanded its solutions to utilities, healthcare, home security,
financial services, and content distribution industries. CSG generates about 60% of revenues from cable and satellite,
and 40% from other segments. About 85% of revenues are generated in the U.S. CSG was founded in 1994 and its
headquarters is in Greenwood Village, Colo.

Business Risk: Fair
CSG's business profile assessment reflects its significant customer concentration and operations in a highly
competitive landscape, which is partly offset by the company's largely recurring revenue base under long-term
contracts. Moreover, customer contracts have high switching costs because of the integrated nature of CSG's offerings.
Contract renewal price discounts for its key clients remain an ongoing threat to revenue growth. These discounts have
historically ranged from 10%-15%, and it typically takes CSG about four quarters to generate enough ancillary revenue
to offset the effects of these price reductions. CSG has been able to mitigate some revenue loss by selling additional
products and services to its customers. CSG's contracts with its major customers runs through 2020 (Comcast—June
2020, Charter—December 2021, and DISH—December 2021), which provides some revenue visibility from these
customers.
In addition, the company and industry as a whole face new challenges with the continued adoption of over-the-top
(OTT) services, which have made it easier for consumers to receive and pay for those services. To meet these
challenges and provide more delivery and payment options to consumers, the company has CSG Ascendon (formerly
known as Content Direct), a cloud-based platform that offers consumers payment options on any digital device. We
believe the company's leadership in the emerging OTT segment should allow it to maintain growth in line with its
traditional services.

Peer comparison
We consider Amdocs Ltd. as CSG's strongest rating peer. Although both Amdocs and CSG enjoy a high recurring
revenue base under long-term contracts, we view Amdocs as having a stronger business profile. We believe Amdocs
has greater growth potential because of its long-term relationships with its base of wireless and telecom company
clients and its expertise in the telecommunication industry. In addition, Amdocs' customer concentration is modestly
lower, with AT&T accounting for 27% of revenues (as of fiscal year 2018) and its ten largest customers representing
66% of revenues. Although Amdocs' revenues and cash flows are significantly larger than CSG's, CSG's weighted
average margin, in the mid-20% area, is higher than Amdocs', which is the low-20% area. Moreover, CSG has
historically had a reputation for being a more efficient operator, which is reflected in its return on capital as well as its
margins.

Financial Risk: Minimal
The company's adjusted leverage was 1.5x as of June 30, 2019, still well within the thresholds that we've set for the
'BB+' rating. Barring any additional debt-financed acquisitions, we expect the company to reduce adjusted leverage,
net of 100% of cash, to around 1x over the next few years. The company's sizable cash balance has a big impact on its
leverage and debt payback ratios. A depletion of cash balances for acquisitions or shareholder returns, however, could
increase leverage above our base case. Assuming relatively stable cash balances, we expect that over the next few
years most of CSG's debt reduction will happen as the company amortizes its bank loan.
The company's capital allocation strategy is to return half its FOCF to shareholders and invest the rest in its business.
Assuming the company sticks to its plan, we expect it to return to leverage of 1x or less by 2020, while maintaining
strong liquidity. This low level of debt would typically result in a higher credit rating. However, we have lowered our
assessment of the company's financial policy by one-notch because CSG has been acquisitive, and we think that
further debt-financed acquisitions could push leverage to 1.5x-2.5x.
In addition, CSG can redeem its 2016 convertible notes for cash, shares of its common stock, or some combination
thereof beginning in March 2020. (Holders can force conversion beginning on Dec. 15, 2021.) Depending on its stock
price, we believe CSG may issue debt to redeem the notes, which are already included in our debt calculation.

Liquidity: Strong
We consider CSG's liquidity to be strong. We expect sources of liquidity to exceed uses by 7x over the next 12 to 24
months and net sources to remain positive, even with a 30% drop in forecast EBITDA. We view CSG's bank
relationships as sound, its credit market standing as satisfactory, and its risk management as prudent. Although certain
quantitative measures reflect characteristics that we normally associate with an exceptional liquidity assessment, we
do not believe the company will take necessary actions to maintain continued exceptional liquidity over the longer
term because it may make acquisitions or increase shareholder returns.

Principal Liquidity Sources
• Cash and short-term investments of $114 million as of June 30, 2019;
• Full availability under the company's $200 million revolving credit facility due 2023; and
• Funds from operations of roughly $150 million to $160 million.

Principal Liquidity Uses
• Capital expenditures of about $30 million-$40 million;
• Modest annual debt amortization of $9 million;
• Expected dividend payments of $30 million-$35 million annually; and
• Working capital outflow $10 million.

Debt maturities
• 2019: $7.5 million
• 2020: $10.3 million
• 2021: $14.1 million
• 2022: $15.0 million

Covenant Analysis
Compliance expectations
We expect company to maintain at least 30% EBITDA cushion over the next couple of years.

Requirements
The company has maximum consolidated net leverage covenant of 4.0x and interest coverage covenant of 2.0x.

Issue Ratings - Recovery Analysis
Key analytical factors
• Our simulated default scenario contemplates a decline in revenue and margins because of a material drop in
subscribers, the loss of key customers and contracts, and mounting competitive pressures. This would cause the
company's cash flow to decline to the point that it is unable to cover its fixed charges (interest expense, required
amortization, and minimum maintenance capital expenditures), and would default in 2023.
• We have valued the company on a going-concern basis using a 5x multiple of our projected emergence EBITDA.
We use an emergence EBITDA multiple of 5x, which is lower than many rated telecom and cable peers, due to the
asset-light nature of the customer service business. The company's fixed charges, which includes interest expenses,
maintenance capital spending, and debt amortization, drive EBITDA at emergence level in the year of default.
• Other default assumptions include an 85% draw on the revolving credit facility; LIBOR rises to 2.5%; the spread on
the revolving credit facility rises to 5% as covenant amendments are obtained; and all debt includes six months of
prepetition interest.

Simulated default assumptions

Simplified waterfall

• Simulated year of default: 2023

• Net enterprise value (after 5% administrative costs):
$263 million

• EBITDA at emergence: $55 million
• EBITDA multiple: 5x

• Valuation split in % (obligors/nonobligors): 100/0
• Collateral value available to secured creditors: $263
million
• Secured first-lien debt claims: $277 million
• —Recovery expectations: 90% to 100%; rounded
estimate: 90%
All debt amounts include six months of prepetition
interest.
