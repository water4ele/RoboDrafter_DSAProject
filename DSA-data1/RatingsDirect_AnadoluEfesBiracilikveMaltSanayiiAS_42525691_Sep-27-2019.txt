The Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV deal in Russia is credit positive. S&P Global Ratings views positively Anadolu Efes
Biracilik ve Malt Sanayii AS' (AEFES') beer joint venture with Belgium-based Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV in Russia
and Ukraine, which started in 2018. AEFES is now co-leader in this region, head to head with Carlsberg (not rated), has
a strong portfolio of brands, and a large footprint. The Anheuser-Busch InBev partnership also furthers earnings
diversification outside Turkey, taking into account that beer has higher profitability then soft drinks and that
profitability in Turkey beer has been declining.
The expansion strategy is likely to remain prudent.AEFES' ventures into new territories via a Coke license are limited
because they would depend on a decision from The Coca-Cola Company (A+/Stable/A-1). That said, AEFES could
grow through bolt-on acquisitions of local brands. We think it is unlikely that AEFES would acquire a significant beer
player in its current market-leading status. We think its joint venture with Anheuser-Busch InBev in Russia and Ukraine
effectively mitigates operational risks in these large territories.
Group profitability should gradually stabilize by 2020. The decreasing operating margin in the Turkish beer market
due to unfavorable economic conditions will likely continue to weigh on AEFES' profitability. We also think
profitability should remain flat to slightly negative in soft drinks due to less favorable market conditions in Turkey and
Pakistan. That said, the operating margin in international beer, notably Russia, should increase thanks to economies of
scale, cost synergies, and a larger product portfolio with more premium offering.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on AEFES reflects our view that the group should be able to continue generating stable free
operating cash flow (FOCF) and maintain moderate debt leverage over the next two years, despite the difficult
macroeconomic conditions in Turkey.
The business should remain supported by the positive volume growth prospects in the soft drinks market, its larger
scale, and market position in the Russian beer market following the tie-up with Anheuser-Busch InBev, and its
focus on cost controls in Turkey to offset high foreign exchange volatility and continued volume decline in the beer
market.
We also believe that, given the volatile operating environment in Turkey, AEFES is likely to maintain a prudent
financial policy toward debt-financed acquisitions and shareholder remuneration.
We believe AEFES should maintain adjusted debt to EBITDA well within 2x-3x and funds from operations (FFO)
to debt of 30%-45%, is in line with the current rating.

Downside scenario
We could take a negative rating action if we saw a weakening operating performance over the next two years. This
could arise from a decrease in volume growth in soft drinks combined with a decline in volume growth and
profitability in beer in Russia. Slowing growth in soft drinks could come from slowing demand in large markets
such as Pakistan, and price pressure from competitors. A setback in volumes and profitability from beer operations
in Russia could arise from negative consumption trends and pricing pressures, together with an inability to achieve
planned cost synergies.
We could also take a negative rating action if adjusted debt to EBITDA rose on a sustained basis to between
2.5x-3.0x and funds from operations (FFO) to debt declined to about 30%. This could come from AEFES' inability
to manage cash flow generation and debt leverage in the current high currency-exchange volatility in Turkey, or it
could reflect a more aggressive financial policy.
We would lower the ratings if we lowered the foreign currency rating on Turkey to 'B' from 'B+'. We would also
view negatively a weakening of AEFES' liquidity position, for example due to a lower share of hard
currency-denominated cash balances and cash flow generation.

Upside scenario
An upgrade appears remote at this time given that we already rate AEFES four notches above our 'B+' foreign
currency sovereign rating on Turkey. This is the maximum allowed under our criteria.
We also note that AEFES continues to experience operational challenges in Turkey, notably in the beer operations,
which faces volume decline and lower profitability.
We think it likely that the group's cash flow generation and debt metrics will continue to face high foreign currency
volatility over at least the next 12 months, which does not support the case for improved credit metrics compared

to 2017.

Our Base-Case Scenario
Assumptions

• We assume the Turkish economy will contract by
0.5% in 2019 but rebound to +3.0% in 2020. We
assume the Turkish lira (TRY) to weaken slightly
against U.S. dollar in 2019 and 2020.
• Revenue growth of about 20% in 2019 and about
10%-15% in 2020. This is mostly due to high price
inflation in Turkey despite volume decline due to
affordability pressures, positive currency exchange,
price increases, and higher volumes in international
beer based on the wider product offering, relatively
high price inflation (Turkey and Pakistan) but
low-single-digit volume growth in soft drinks.

• Adjusted EBITDA margin of about 15.0%-16.0%,
derived mostly from the large and increasing share
of earnings from soft drinks (which is lower margin
than beer), higher margin in international beer
thanks to cost synergies and product range and
lower profitability in beer in Turkey due to higher
raw materials costs and currency-exchange
movements despite strong hedging coverage.
• FFO of about TRY2.2 billion-TRY2.7 billion, driven
by a higher EBITDA, offset by higher interest
expenses.
• FOCF of about TRY850 million-TRY950 million
annually, assuming capital expenditure (capex) of
8.5% of revenue.
• Adjusted net debt of about TRY7 billion-TRY8
billion, assuming negative transaction effects from
the large level of debt in U.S. dollars and euros,
annual cash dividends of TRY300 million-TRY400
million, but no acquisitions. We evaluate restricted
cash at about TRY950 million at Dec. 31, 2018.

Base-Case Assumptions
Long track record of positive free cash flow. Despite some pressure on profitability, high financing costs in lira, and
taking into account the working capital and capex intensity of the business, AEFES has developed a sound track record
of generating positive FOCF over the past five years. For the coming two years, we forecast AEFES will generate
about TRY850 million-TRY950 million annually, slightly lower than in 2018 due to higher interest costs.
Disciplined financial policy supports debt leverage of about 2.0x-2.3x. AEFES has been very prudent in recent years
regarding debt-financed acquisitions. We note that the recent link-up with Anheuser-Busch InBev in Russia and
Ukraine did not weigh on AEFES' credit quality, thanks to limited cash outflows or new debt being issued. Dividends
have often been cut (as we observed in 2016 and 2019) or suspended (2014) when the group had to conserve cash.

Company Description
AEFES is a beer and soft drinks bottling group based in Turkey. The group owns and operates 21 breweries and 26 soft
drinks bottling plants across 16 countries. In 2018, AEFES generated revenues of TRY18.7 billion (approximately €3.1
billion) and adjusted EBITDA of TRY2.9 billion (about €480 million). Beer volume sales amounted to 31.8 million
hectoliters (pro forma) in 2018; soft drinks volumes sales, to 1,315 million unit cases.
AEFES is 43% owned by Anadolu Group Holding, a Turkish conglomerate, and 24% owned by AB InBev Harmony
Ltd., a holding company 100% owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev S.A./N.V. (A-/Negative/A-2). The remaining 33% of
AEFES' shares are free float on Borsa Istanbul.
We believe that AEFES benefits from a supportive corporate governance structure and good transparency in terms of
financial disclosure.

Based on 2018 pro forma figures, beer operations accounted for 43% of group revenue and 40% of group EBITDA.

There are two main beer businesses: Turkey (AEFES' home market), and international operations (through
Netherlands-based subsidiary EBI). The beer operations encompass Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Georgia, and
Moldova. Russia is now the group's largest beer market, ahead of Turkey.
In 2018, soft drinks accounted for 57% of the group's revenue and 60% of its reported EBITDA. The soft drinks
business is run by Coca-Cola Icecek (CCI), a separate legal entity that is also listed, in which AEFES holds a majority
50.3% stake. CCI's other main shareholder is The Coca-Cola Company (A+/Stable/A-1), with 20% of shares. Free float
shares account for 26.7% of the total. CCI is the sixth-largest Coca-Cola bottler worldwide by volume and covers
Turkey, Pakistan, Central Asia, and part of the Middle East.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
AEFES' business model benefits from the low cyclicality of beverage manufacturing. The portfolio is overall well
balanced between soft drinks operations, which are steady but lower-margin (38.5% gross margin in H1 2019), and the
more volatile but higher-margin beer business (34% gross margin in first-half 2019).
AEFES holds leading positions in several large consumer markets (notably Turkey, Russia, and Pakistan). In the beer
segment, the group remains clear market leader in Turkey (60% market share by volume in 2018), and is the co-leader
in Russia, the world's fifth-largest beer market, with 29% market share. The group is also the No. 1 player in beer in a
number of countries in Central Asia (notably Kazakhstan).
Its affiliate CCI is the largest soft drinks bottler in Turkey (65% market share by sales volume) and is No. 2 in Pakistan
(42% market share) behind PepsiCo Inc. (A+/Stable/A-1). We continue to think that volume sales growth prospects
appear stronger in soft drinks than in beer given the large, underpenetrated markets and lower level of regulation
compared with alcoholic beverages. Revenue visibility is supported by the 10-year extension on the bottling agreement
with The Coca-Cola Company signed in 2017.
The group benefits from a portfolio of over 100 own or licensed international and local beverage brands (including
Coca-Cola, Fanta, Sprite, Efes, Bud, and Kozel), which enables it to maintain a price premium in most markets. In
Russia, where the beer market has been stabilizing after years of decline, the group strategically uses its high-end
brands to expand in the higher-margin premium beer market and stabilize profitability.
AEFES has strengthened its market position in Russia and Ukraine following the combination of its beer operations
with those of Anheuser-Busch InBev in April 2018. We estimate that Russia now accounts for the majority of revenue
and earnings in beer, sailing ahead of Turkey. The joint venture is a solid player, with 29% market share in value in
2018, and is now on par with Carlsberg's 29% market share. We believe earnings growth in 2019-2020 should benefit
from cost synergies in production, sales, and distribution. It should also benefit from stronger pricing power thanks to
its larger range of premium brands in the portfolio. We think this should compensate for what we see as a lack of
long-term volume growth prospects in Russia.
Business weaknesses include large exposures to Turkey, Russia, and Pakistan, which carry a high operating risk. We
view positively that following the Anheuser-Busch joint venture, AEFES' country exposure to Turkey has decreased to

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 24, 2019 8

Anadolu Efes Biracilik ve Malt Sanayii AS

about 30%-35% of EBITDA versus 45% in 2017. We believe this somewhat mitigates the impact of the sharp
devaluation of the lira and weak consumer trends in Turkey.
In our view, volume growth prospects in the Turkish beer market remain constrained by the higher excise taxes, strict
regulation, and lower consumer affordability despite improved tourism inflow. We also note higher level of
competition. AEFES has responded by reorganizing its production and distribution, and repositioning its product
portfolio toward value products.
The Russian beer market rebounded last year thanks to the FIFA World Cup and continues to grow in 2019. AEFES's
market share has risen to close to 30%, but the group faces price pressure from retailers and competitors. Also the risk
of higher excise tax rises and stricter regulations like restrictions on PET plastic bottles will likely persist, constraining
growth prospects in Russia.
AEFES is exposed to volatile commodity costs (such as barley, resins, aluminum, and sugar), some of which are priced
in U.S. dollars. Raw material costs will thus increase in 2019-2020, especially in Turkey. However, this should be partly
contained with the large hedging coverage and ability to raise prices to protect margins. That said, strong price rises
can hinder volume sales.
Finally, we see the business as relatively capital-intensive due to the level of capex (8.5% of revenue). In addition, there
are some large swings in working capital throughout the year because of the inventory build-up in preparation for the
summer selling season.

Peer comparison
We compare AEFES with Saudi Arabia-based food and beverage producer Almarai Company (BBB-/Stable/A-3),
Turkey-based appliances manufacturer Arcelik A.S. (BB+/Negative/--), and Switzerland-based soft drinks bottler
Coca-Cola HBC (AG).
Almarai has similar revenue and free cash flow base compared with AEFES. However, the business is more diversified
owing to the Saudi company's divisions in dairy products, baked goods, poultry, and juices. Also, Almarai's profitability
is much higher, with EBITDA margin of about 30% versus AEFES' 15%-16%. That said, revenue growth prospects
have receded for Almarai, which has flat revenue growth, and it is geographically concentrated to Saudi Arabia, where
it generates two-thirds of its revenue, and small countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council. Furthermore, Almarai is
more leveraged, with S&P Global Ratings-adjusted debt to EBITDA of more than 3x, against about 2x for AEFES, due
to its large capex program in the past.
CCH is bigger than AEFES by revenue and EBITDA base due to the large production and distribution scale across
parts of Europe, Russia, and Nigeria. Profitability levels are similar to the soft drinks operations of CCI (subsidiary of
AEFES). CCH results can also suffer from the high foreign exchange volatility in high-risk countries like Nigeria and
Russia, are two of its largest markets. That said, overall CCH has good geographical diversity in mature European
markets like Italy or Poland. Debt leverage was very low in 2018 but we forecast it to increase to about 2.0x in 2019
due to increasing shareholder remuneration.
Like AEFES, Arcelik is a Turkey-based consumer group and has similar revenue and EBITDA base to AEFES. Arcelik

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 24, 2019 9

Anadolu Efes Biracilik ve Malt Sanayii AS

also has a significant portion of its debt in hard currencies. Arcelik operates in a less profitable consumer segment than
bottling with a larger working capital intensity due to the dealership network in Turkey. Arcelik has more exposure to
Western Europe, which generates a significant amount of earnings in hard currency. Still, its credit metrics are weaker
than those of AEFES. In particular, we note our estimate of Arcelik's EBITDA interest coverage of 2.0x-2.5x in 2019
due to the large amount of lira-denominated debt bearing high interest rate, that helps fund the working capital.

refinancing risks over the next three years. In our view, this offsets the large translational currency-exchange volatility
affecting its mostly U.S. dollar-denominated debt.
For 2019-2020, we forecast AEFES to generate free cash flow of about TRY800 million-TRY925 million annually,
driven mostly by higher earnings from the international beer segment (notably from the Anheuser-Busch InBev joint
venture and slightly higher earnings in soft drinks offset by flat earnings from the beer operations in Turkey. We also
account for higher interest expenses in countries like Turkey and rising capex of about TRY2 billion annually. We note
that working capital has tightened in both the beer and soft drinks businesses, supporting internal cash flows. Capex
should increase slightly, with expansion capex mostly at CCI level in countries like Pakistan.
Despite our assumption that the profitability of beer operations in Turkey will continue to decline in 2019-2020, due
notably to adverse currency-exchange movements, we believe that the cash flow profile is now better diversified. We
estimate that the Turkey operations (beer and soft drinks) now generates about 30%-35% of the group EBITDA while
the international beer operations (Russia, Ukraine, and Central Asia) equally generate about 30%-35% of group
EBITDA. The rest being the soft drinks business in Pakistan and other territories outside Turkey. In the international
beer revenues are mostly in local currencies (the largest being the Russian ruble) but cash balances are then partly
converted to U.S. dollars and held outside Turkey.
We forecast credit metrics to weaken slightly in 2019 versus 2018 and stabilize in 2020. Negative currency-exchange
movements due to the weak lira is the main reason. At end-June 2019, AEFES had 85% of its debt denominated in U.S.
dollars and euros, while about 30%-35% its EBITDA is generated in Turkey in local currency. We also note that the
ruble has been steady versus hard currencies but that foreign exchange risk could also materialize on earnings from
Central Asian markets and Pakistan. In our base case, we see adjusted debt leverage rising to 2.0x-2.2x in 2019 (versus
1.9x in 2018) and FFO to debt lowering to 30%-35% (versus 38% in 2017).
Near-term refinancing risks appear limited with only the $500 million of senior notes in November 2022 at AEFES level
being significant. We also note that both the beer and soft drinks operations, which are managed autonomously, are
free cash flow positive. Interest-rate risk is limited by more than 80% of the debt being fixed or hedged.
We view positively AEFES' very prudent financial policy on acquisitions and its stable but flexible dividend policy. In a
challenging environment in Turkey, AEFES has protected its financial ratios by lowering its dividend in 2019 compared
with 2018. This is in line with past measures, such as a dividend freeze in 2014 and cutting dividends in half in 2016.

Liquidity: Adequate
We assess AEFES' liquidity as adequate. We forecast that the ratio of liquidity sources to uses will exceed 1.2x over the
next 12 months.
We note that both the beer and the soft drinks businesses are free cash flow positive and can thereby service their own
debt independently. In addition, AEFES maintains large cash balances in hard currencies (67% of total cash at
June-end 2019) to match operating needs for raw materials and upcoming debt maturities, as 84% of the debt at
June-end 2019 is in USD or EUR. We also note that the majority of cash balances are held outside Turkey. The next
large debt maturity (greater than 20% of total debt) being the $500 million senior notes of AEFES due November 2022.
We also factor into our liquidity assessment the group's well-established relationships with a large pool of local and
international banks, prudent risk management, and broadly satisfactory standing in the credit markets as demonstrated
by the recent bond issuance at CCI's level. We note that AEFES and CCI had significant headroom (more than 30%)
under their financial covenants on June 30, 2019.
AEFES has no long-term undrawn committed credit lines, but has access to uncommitted undrawn credit lines from
various banks. We understand that this is market practice in Turkey and that AEFES has been able to draw under these
credit lines to meet its short-term funding needs.

Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Cash balances and short-term investments of
TRY4.8 billion on June 30, 2019.

• Debt repayments of TRY3.2 billion within one year
from June 30, 2019. About TRY460 million at the
debt due are shareholder loans to Anheuser-Busch
InBev.

• Our forecast of cash FFO of about TRY2.8 billion in
the next 12 months.

• Our estimate of maintenance capex of about TRY1.3
billion in the next 12 months.
• Our forecast of cash dividends of about TRY300
million in the next 12 months.

Debt maturities
As at June 30, 2019 (mil. US$):
• 2019: 325
• 2020: 222
• 2021: 16
• 2022: 519 (including $500 million of senior notes issued by Anadolu Efes)
• 2023 and after: 663

Covenant Analysis
Compliance expectations
AEFES and affiliate CCI have significant (greater than 30%) headroom under their respective financial covenants.

Requirements
CCI has two maintenance financial covenants: Maximum net debt to EBITDA less than 3.25x (was 1.67x at June-end
2019) and net interest coverage greater than 4x (was at 9.8x at June-end 2019).
AEFES has only maintenance financial covenants (debt leverage on subsidiary EBI and interest coverage) on a small
bank loan maturing early 2020.

Rating Above The Sovereign
We rate AEFES four notches above our 'B+' foreign currency sovereign credit rating on Turkey, which is the maximum
allowed under our criteria, and above our 'BB-' transfer and convertibility assessment on Turkey. The hypothetical
scenario of sovereign default assumes a 50% devaluation of the Turkish lira against hard currencies. We believe that
AEFES will be able to meet its debt obligations in such a stress scenario.
In our analysis, we take into account that AEFES operates in the beverages manufacturing sector, which we consider

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 24, 2019 13

Anadolu Efes Biracilik ve Malt Sanayii AS

has moderate sensitivity to country risk. We note that the business is relatively noncyclical, AEFES does not depend
on government contracts or subsidies, and the group is free to price its products in Turkey.
In addition, AEFES maintains large cash balances in hard currencies (67% at end-June 2019) at all times, holding most
of its cash outside Turkey. We also estimate that the group now generates 70%-75% of its EBITDA from outside
Turkey. There are no large debt maturities (greater than 20% of total debt) until 2022. Liquidity sources sufficiently
cover short-term debt, working capital, and capex needs under a stressed economic scenario reflecting a hypothetical
sovereign default.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
Most of the debt is senior unsecured and held at holding companies level: Either Anadolu Efes (beer business) or at
Coca-Cola Icecek A.S. (soft drinks business). We note that the interest on AEFES' $500 million senior notes due
November 2022 is serviced mostly by the positive cash flows from the beer operations and by the dividends received
from affiliate holding company Coca-Cola Icecek A.S. (not rated).

Analytical conclusions
We rate AEFES' long-term senior unsecured notes issued 'BBB-', in line with the issuer credit rating. This is because we
see limited structural subordination in the capital structure.
