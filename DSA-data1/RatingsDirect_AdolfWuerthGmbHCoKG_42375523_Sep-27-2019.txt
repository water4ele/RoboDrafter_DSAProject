Overview
Key Strengths

Key Risks

Leading provider of low ticket items for the global repair and
construction industry, with a strong brand.

High concentration in mature and fragmented Western European markets
(57% of 2018 sales including Germany), where economic growth is slowing
down.

Wide product diversity and extensive distribution network, with
diversified customer and supplier base.

Some exposure to cyclical industries like construction, automotive, and
electronics, the latter two of which are facing declining market demand.

Cautious financial policy, with a solid track record in preserving
balance sheet strength and maintaining stable credit metrics
with adjusted funds from operations (FFO) to debt around 50%
(weighted five-year average).

Weakening free operating cash flow (FOCF) generation in past two years due
to high capital expenditure (capex) and working capital outflow, which has led
to a continued increase in net debt. However, the impact on leverage has been
more than offset by higher earnings.

We expect revenue and EBITDA will continue to grow, but at a slower pace. Amid increased economic headwinds,
especially declining market demand in the automotive and electronics sectors, Wuerth's revenue growth will slow
down. Softening market conditions and intense competition in an inflationary cost environment will lead to slightly
lower margins. As a result, we expect flat-to-modest growth in EBITDA in 2019.
FOCF generation is set to improve thanks to lower working capital outflows. Despite subdued earnings growth, FOCF
will strengthen and net debt will remain on par with 2018 mainly because of much lower working capital outflows, in
line with lower sales growth, and more-efficient inventory management.
Leverage ratios will remain reasonably stable.Wuerth's leverage ratios will be slightly weaker than the previous two
years, but still reasonably stable with S&P Global Ratings-adjusted FFO to debt of 45%-50% and S&P Global
Ratings-adjusted debt to EBITDA of 1.5x-1.8x in 2019-2020.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on Germany-based Wuerth reflects our view that the group's profitability will remain at about
current levels, with an S&P Global Ratings-adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.5%-11.0%, underpinned by a continued
focus on efficiency. The stable outlook also reflects our view that management's cautious financial policy should
enable the group to maintain modest leverage levels. We forecast that S&P Global Ratings-adjusted debt to
EBITDA will remain 1.5x-2.0x and FFO to debt will stay about 45%-50% in the next 24 months. The outlook also
assumes that the group's liquidity will remain at least adequate.

Downside scenario
We could lower the ratings if the group implemented a more aggressive financial policy than we currently expect,
including materially higher shareholder returns, or larger-than-expected debt-funded acquisitions, leading to a
material and prolonged weakening of credit metrics such that adjusted debt to EBITDA exceeded 2x and FFO to
debt was below 40%. A lasting deterioration in margins could also weigh on the ratings.

Upside scenario
The potential for an upgrade is currently limited, in our view. However, we could consider raising the ratings if we
believed that the group could sustain stronger leverage metrics, with adjusted debt to EBITDA of about 1.5x and
adjusted FFO to debt approaching 60%, with a financial policy that supports such credit measures over the long
term.

Company Description
Headquartered in Kunzelsau, Germany, the family trust-owned Wuerth group is the largest global distributor of
assembly products in the maintenance, repair, and operations industry, mainly selling to small and midsize industrial
companies. The group sells more than 125,000 different own-brand products in its core business to the automotive,
electrical components, metalworking, woodworking, and craft industries, which generated around 56% of group
revenues in 2018. Acquired entities that maintain their individual brand names are combined under allied companies,
contributing around 44% of revenues. In 2018, the Wuerth group generated sales of about €13.6 billion and reported
EBITDA of about €1.3 billion.

Business Risk: Strong
Wuerth's business risk reflects its large size and broad geographic presence; its leading market positions in highly
fragmented assembly products distribution markets; an extensive, multi-channel distribution network that is difficult to
replicate; and substantial product diversity coupled with well-diversified end-customer and supplier bases.

With sales of about €13.6 billion in 2018, Wuerth is one of the world's largest building materials distributors. The group
has a broad geographic presence with high exposure to mature markets in Western Europe. In 2018, it derived 81.0%
of revenues in Europe, of which 42.4% generated in Germany, followed by 14.4% in Western Europe. It mainly
operates in developed countries with mature and highly competitive markets, which somewhat limits potential for
organic sales growth and margin improvement. With this in mind, Wuerth has been gradually shifting its sales model
from predominantly direct sales to a more balanced multi-channel approach (through sales branch offices and
e-commerce). In addition, the group will continue undertaking small and midsize bolt-on acquisitions.
Chart 2

The group also benefits from a diverse customer and supplier base--it deals with more than 125,000 products, and
serves more than three million customers in industries ranging across metal and wood processing, auto manufacturing,
construction, and a wide range of industrial trades. The 10 largest customers are mainly large industrial corporations
and account for less than 4% of the group's sales.
Wuerth operates in a highly fragmented industry that is also subject to moderate cyclicality. We expect to see
continuous pressure on margins due to purchasing-costs inflation, high fragmentation, and competition in distribution
markets, as well as some negative mix effects from an increasing share of lower-margin e-business. However, this will
be somewhat offset by customers' perception that the group's products are low ticket and most of them are premium

products for the craft segment, supporting the track record of healthy and resilient profit margins. We also believe that
Wuerth's strong focus on operating efficiency should help it sustain potential pressure on margins over the next couple
of years.

Financial Risk: Modest
Our financial risk assessment reflects our expectation that Wuerth's key credit metrics weaken slightly compared to the
previous two years, but remain resilient, with adjusted FFO to debt of 45%-50% and adjusted debt to EBITDA of
1.5x-1.8x in 2019-2020. Due to increased economic headwinds, especially declining market demand in the automotive
and electronics sectors, Wuerth's revenue growth will slow down to 4%-5% in 2019-2020 from above 7% in 2017-2018.
Softening market conditions and intense competition in an inflationary cost environment will lead to slightly lower
margin of 10.5%-11.0%, versus 11.1% S&P Global Ratings-adjusted EBITDA margin in the past two years. As a result,
we anticipate flat to modest EBITDA growth in 2019.
Wuerth's operating performance in the first half of 2019 confirmed our expectation of a more difficult economic
environment with a slowdown in topline growth and increasing margin pressure. In the first six months of 2019, sales
growth moderated to 5.2% and the margin was lower than one year ago as the group could not fully pass rising
purchasing prices on to customers due to market competition.
Despite the subdued growth in EBITDA, we expect FOCF generation will strengthen and net debt will remain stable
compared to 2018, mainly driven by much lower working capital requirements in line with slower growth, and
benefiting from more efficient inventory management. Capex will remain high at €600 million-€650 million in
2019-2020 to support expansion. And net dividend distribution will remain unchanged in 2019. We also anticipate
management will remain committed to a cautious financial policy, and liquidity will remain at least adequate.
In 2018, Wuerth's operating performance remained strong and reported record sales and operating profits. Sales grew
by 7.1% to €13.6 billion. Robust revenue growth is attributed to positive fundamentals across almost all key markets
and business divisions, especially double-digit growth in Eastern and Southern Europe. It also reflects the group's
implementation of its multi-channel strategy, with e-business sales growing by 24.6%. The high revenue growth
coupled with a continuous focus on productivity and cost control has maintained profitability, with adjusted EBITDA
margin remaining stable at 11.1%. However, net debt continued to increase in 2018 mainly due to increasing capex
and high working capital outflows, driven by sales growth and high inventory levels (due to higher input costs and
some one-off effects). As a result, debt to EBITDA weakened slightly to 1.7x in 2018 from 1.6x one year ago and FFO
to debt to 49.9% from 50.6%.
In Wuerth's adjusted figures we deconsolidate the bank and leasing activities (for more details please see the
reconciliation table), because we do not view these as core business for Wuerth and deconsolidation will allow us to
better understand, analyze, and reflect the credit quality of Wuerth.
We expect the implementation of IFRS 16 will have a very limited impact on Wuerth's adjusted figures, given our
estimate of only a small gap between our operating lease adjustments and the impact of IFRS 16 as expected by
Wuerth.

Liquidity: Adequate
We view Wuerth's liquidity position as adequate, based on our forecast that the group's sources of liquidity will exceed
its uses by more than 1.2x over the next 12 months from July 1, 2019. We note that a €500 million bond is maturing in
May 2020--in less than 12 months. Given Wuerth's strong track record of refinancing and good standing in the capital
market, we view the refinancing risk for the bond due 2020 as limited.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

As a global distributor of assembly products in the building materials industry, Wuerth's exposure to environmental
risks is lower than for heavy building materials and cement companies. Although the chemicals business unit
accounts for only 3.9% of group sales in 2018, environmental issues could lead to supply bottlenecks and higher
purchasing prices for some commodities. For example, Chinese authorities have considerably tightened their
environmental controls in recent years, leading to shutdowns in some capacities. This has led to a tenser situation
on the Chinese procurement market and pushed up prices accordingly. However, we expect the solid growth in
sales will more than offset the increase in input costs.
We view governance as neutral to the rating. The Wuerth family remains heavily involved in the overall
development of the group and continues to have a strong say in key strategic decisions, as reflected in the fact that
supervisory board includes three family and two nonfamily members. However, we think the management
structure is effective and will appropriately balance all stakeholders' interests.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
Wuerth's capital structure consists of about €100 million of prior-ranked bank debt at operating subsidiaries, €175
million of unsecured U.S. private placement, and €1.6 billion senior unsecured notes issued by Wuerth Finance
International B.V. as of March 31, 2019.

Analytical conclusions
The issue rating on the senior unsecured notes issued by Wuerth Finance International B.V. and guaranteed by Wuerth
is 'A', in line with the issuer credit rating on Wuerth. The amount of prior-ranking liabilities is limited and does not
warrant notching down the ratings on the debt, given the group's diversity and the concentration of financial debt at
the finance subsidiary (about 85%).
