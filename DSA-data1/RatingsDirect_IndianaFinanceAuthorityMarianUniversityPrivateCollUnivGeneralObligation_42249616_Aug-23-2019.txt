Long Term Rating

Rationale
S&P Global Ratings assigned its 'BBB' rating to the series 2019A and 2019B educational facilities revenue bonds issued
by the Indiana Finance Authority on behalf of Marian University (Marian, or MU). At the same time, S&P Global
Ratings affirmed its 'BBB' rating on MU's series 2011 bonds, which will be refunded with the series 2019A and 2019B
issuance. The outlook is stable.
We assessed Marian's enterprise profile as strong, characterized by a growing number of academic programs that have
sustained continued enrollment growth, in addition to stable acceptance and matriculation rates. We assessed Marian's
financial profile as adequate, characterized by robust operating margins, sufficient available resources, and a
moderately high pro forma maximum annual debt service (MADS) burden. Combined, we believe these credit factors
lead to an indicative stand-alone credit profile of 'bbb', and a final rating of 'BBB'.
The 'BBB' rating reflects our assessment of Marian's strengths:
• Robust enrollment growth, with full-time-equivalent (FTE) enrollment increasing by nearly 25% over a five-year
period, combined with a generally stable demand profile, though we note enrollment appears to be stable in fall
2019 compared to the prior year;
• Strong operating margins, with fiscal 2018 achieving an impressive $12.3 million operating surplus, equivalent to a
10.7% operating margin, and with fiscal 2019 slated to produce a similarly robust margin; and
• A stable and experienced management team that has consistently executed the university's strategic plan that
included goals to grow enrollment and program offerings.
Our assessment of Marian's weaknesses include its:
• Highly student-dependent revenue base, with student-generated revenues accounting for 89% of total revenues as

AUGUST 15, 2019 2

of fiscal 2018;
• Modest declines in available resources and an increase in total debt though, though we note resources still remain
sufficient for the rating category and are expected to grow in fiscal 2019; and
• Moderately high pro forma MADS burden of 6.9% of fiscal 2018 operating expenses.
The series 2019A ($16 million) bonds comprise new money and will be issued to construct a new residence hall and
acquire an existing facility, renovate an existing residence hall, and fund the furnishing and deferred maintenance
needs of several other buildings on campus. The series 2019B ($104 million) bonds will be used to refund the existing
series 2011 bonds for savings. Securing the bonds is a general obligation of the university. Post-issuance, Marian
University's debt will total $119.5 million, consisting almost entirely of the series 2019 bonds. Debt service on the
bonds is relatively level for the first 20 years, with MADS of $8.01 million in 2021. We view debt service as manageable
and feel that the university can accommodate the additional debt.
MU is a private Catholic university established in 1851 by the Sisters of St. Francis, with a main campus in
Indianapolis. MU provides mainly traditional and degree completion programs for undergraduate students. It also
offers master's degrees in Education, Biomedical Sciences, and Counseling, and it established the College of
Osteopathic Medicine (COM) in August 2013. Marian graduated its first COM cohort in May 2017 and received full
accreditation from the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation. COM is the second medical school in the
state, other than Indiana University, which we believe adds strength to the university's demand profile. MU also offers
an accelerated online nursing program in conjunction with Ascension Health, which allows students with non-nursing
undergraduate degrees to obtain a Bachelor's of Science in nursing in 16 months, along with the Marian Adult
Programs, which is an undergraduate degree completion program for nontraditional students.

Outlook
The stable outlook reflects our expectation that the university will maintain or improve enrollment and will at least
maintain other demand-related metrics in line with its strategic plan. We anticipate continued growth across all
programs, including the COM. The stable outlook also reflects our expectation that operating results will remain robust
and available resource ratios will improve. We also do not expect any additional debt without commensurate growth
in available resources.

Upside scenario
We could consider a positive rating action during the outlook period if available resources strengthen, and if operating
margins remain robust. We also expect that the university will continue its trend of sustained enrollment growth across
academic programs, and will not see material declines to its demand profile, as measured by applications, selectivity,
or matriculation.

Downside scenario
We could consider a negative rating action during the outlook period if enrollment declines, if the university produces
financial deficits, or if available resource ratios decline significantly relative to the rating category and to those of
peers. We would also view additional debt without commensurate growth in available resources negatively, given

MU's already high debt burden.

Enterprise Profile
Industry risk
Industry risk addresses the higher education sector's overall cyclicality and competitive risk and growth by applying
various stress scenarios and evaluating barriers to entry, levels and trends of profitability, substitution risk, and growth
trends observed in the industry. We believe the higher education sector represents a low credit risk when compared
with other industries and sectors.

Economic fundamentals
In our view, the university has weak geographic diversity. About 73% of students are from Indiana. As a result, our
assessment of Marian's economic fundamentals is anchored by the GDP per capita.

Market position and demand
Enrollment has continually improved at MU over the past five years, increasing by nearly 25% over this period to
3,111 FTEs in fall 2018. Initial fall 2019 results indicate flat to modestly declining enrollment, with FTE enrollment for
fall 2019 currently at 3,060. We note that results may change once finalized. We view the enrollment stability in fall
2019 as adequate, and would view further growth in enrollment favorably. Management attributes the growth over the
past several years mostly to new programs (including its COM), and to recent partnerships with institutions of higher
education in the area. Although enrollment is flat for fall 2019, we expect it to continue to improve as management
increases graduate program offerings, adult program offerings, online offerings, "work and learn" offerings, and
expands recruiting efforts. Retention rates have been relatively stable at about 77% over the past five years, and
management indicates an initial retention rate of 80% for fall 2019. We note that part of the strategic plan is focused on
improving retention, with a goal of reaching 85% by 2025. We view this goal as achievable within this time frame, and
would view improvement in retention positively.
As part of the strategic plan, management announced a goal of increasing enrollment to 4,200 by 2024-2025, which
would include 750 additional graduate students and 500 additional undergraduate students. Management aims to
develop additional graduate programming, especially in the sciences. We believe the growth plan is moderately
aggressive on the graduate side, though we note the recent success of COM enrollment over the past several school
years.
Freshmen applications rose in fall 2018 to a new peak of 2,325, an increase of 12.5% over a five-year period. Fall 2019
initial results show 2,634 applications, and we view this growth favorably. We note that there is no cost to apply to
Marian University, and therefore we expect Marian's applicant pool to increase within the outlook period, thereby
allowing MU to select students from a broader base, which we view positively. We consider MU selective relative to
medians, with a 61.4% acceptance rate in fall 2018, a decline from 57.6% in fall 2014. Although selectivity rates are still
within the moderately selective range, we would view further deterioration in the selectivity rate negatively. Initial fall
2019 selectivity is 62.5%, essentially equivalent to the prior fall selectivity rate. Matriculation rates have improved
modestly as selectivity has remained flat; the fall 2018 matriculation rate was a good 29.8%, and can be attributed
partially to a broader base of applicants. Initial fall 2019 results anticipate matriculation of 25.2%. We would view

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

AUGUST 15, 2019 4

Indiana Finance Authority Marian University; Private Coll/Univ - General Obligation

increased matriculation positively, though we expect it to moderate to roughly its current level going forward.
Freshman student quality has typically been just under the national SAT average, with the Marian University average
SAT score of 1127 for the fall 2018 semester. We expect SAT scores to remain around the national average within the
outlook period. The six-year graduation rate is relatively weak, at 57.6%, though up from 52% in the prior year. MU's
student draw remains highly regional, although we note that MU has managed to attract more out-of-state and
international students recently. Still, about 75% of full-time undergraduate students come from Indiana.
Management has had some success fundraising in recent years, during fiscal 2017, management raised $17.5 million
out of a $20.0 million goal, and it reports that it is now in the public phase of a comprehensive campaign with a stated
goal of $150 million by 2021. As of May 31, 2019, over $116 million has been raised toward this objective. We expect
results from the campaign to be strong relative to fundraising results over the last several years. The university's
ultimate strategic goal is to grow available resources to $350 million by 2025, which we feel is aggressive and will
largely depend on the success of MU's comprehensive campaign. Alumni participation is low, at 19%, but has been
increasing from prior years, a trend that we view favorably.

Management and governance
Under MU's bylaws, its board of trustees must have at least seven members but no more than 50, seven of whom must
be members of Sisters of St. Francis of Oldenburg, and one of whom must be a practicing osteopathic physician.
Currently, the board has 47 members, and there have been no changes to the board aside from normal rotation due to
retirement and term limits. Senior management at the university also remains stable, with no major changes to the
senior management team or senior staff at the university.
MU operates under the guidance of a 10-year strategic plan, which includes five "power" goals focused on maintaining
the mission and identity of the school, improving academic quality, increasing enrollment, improving leadership, and
expanding available resources. We believe that progress is already being made with respect to enrollment, and that
MU will continue to move forward to achieve the various goals. MU budgets on a full-accrual basis, which we view
positively. MU also practices a modified zero-based budgeting system, which requires management to do a line-by-line
investigation of expenses.

Financial Profile
Financial management policies
The university has a formal policy for investments. It operates according to a 10-year strategic plan, and has an
informal liquidity and debt policy mostly centered on its bond covenants. The university meets standard annual
disclosure requirements. The financial policies assessment reflects our opinion that while there may be some areas of
risk, the organization's overall financial policies are not likely to negatively affect its future ability to pay debt service.
Our analysis of financial policies includes a review of the organization's financial reporting and disclosure, investment
allocation and liquidity, debt profile, contingent liabilities, legal structure, and a comparison of these policies with those
of comparable providers.

Financial performance
MU's financial operations on an unrestricted basis are robust. Additional tuition revenue from the COM has boosted
operating margins to new, very robust levels over the last two years, at 6.6% ($7.0 million surplus) in fiscal 2017, and
an even stronger 10.7% ($12.3 million surplus) in fiscal 2018. Prior to fiscal 2017, operating results were negative on a
full-accrual basis, as the university had operating costs associated with the COM without associated operating
revenues. Preliminary fiscal 2019 results indicate another robust operating surplus of about $9.1 million, which we
consider solid and in line with results from the recent past. Management expects to achieve similar levels of operating
success for the foreseeable future. We note that the COM is one of two medical schools in Indiana, which should keep
enrollment at the COM at full capacity, and help to maintain positive operating margins.
MU has historically been reliant on student charges and has shown increasing dependence on student-generated
revenues, which accounted for approximately 89% of revenues in fiscal 2018. Tuition for undergrads and the COM
students is expected to grow next year, and we note tuition at Marian University is in line with that of peers. The
overall discount rate has been declining and may drop further due to additional enrollment in new graduate and
doctoral programs, but the tuition discount rate for undergraduates is expected to increase slightly next year. With the
addition of the COM students and other graduate programming, net tuition revenue has grown 16% relative to fiscal
2017, and has grown in every year since we began rating the university's bonds.

Available resources
Available resources as measured by expendable resources deteriorated in fiscal 2018 to $76.5 million, down from $84.5
million in fiscal 2017. Initial results for fiscal 2019 show growth in unrestricted net assets; therefore, we expect
improvement in available resources for fiscal 2019. Expendable resources relative to fiscal 2018 adjusted operating
expenses equaled 66.3%, which is comparable with medians and higher than those of peers. At the end of fiscal 2018,
expendable resources equaled 76.6% of debt and 64% of pro forma debt, which was slightly lower than medians.
Unrestricted cash and investments are sufficient as of fiscal year-end 2018, totaling $83.5 million, equivalent to 72.3%
of operating expenses, 83.6% of debt, and 69.9% of pro forma debt. Cash and investment ratios are similar to those of
peers.
The endowment, which had a market value of $63.7 million as of fiscal 2018 remains largely liquid. The portfolio is a
mix of 55.8% equities (30.0% domestic equity and 25.8% international equity), 15.1% fixed income, 24.1% alternative
investments, and 5.0% real assets. Initial results for fiscal 2019 show the endowment reaching a new peak of $69.2
million. We note that Marian changed investment advisors over the past year, and expects modest changes to its asset
allocation going forward. Marian endowment returns in fiscal 2018 were approximately 6%. The endowment spending
policy is up to 5%, but the board approved spending policy is lower at 4% starting in fiscal 2018 and going forward. We
view this board-approved rate as sustainable.

Debt and contingent liabilities
Post-issuance total debt for Marian University will be $119.5 million, including $119.3 million of the series 2019A and
2019B bonds and the remainder comprising notes payable. The series 2019 bonds are fixed rate and will be the
university's only long-term debt, structured with level debt service of about $8 million per year. The bond documents
provide several financial covenants, including a debt service coverage covenant of 1.1x (for each rolling four-quarter
period, generally, the change in unrestricted net assets, plus interest and depreciation expense as adjusted for

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

AUGUST 15, 2019 6

Indiana Finance Authority Marian University; Private Coll/Univ - General Obligation

unrealized investment gains and losses). An additional bond covenant requires that the chief financial officer certify
that the university has met the above ratio immediately after it incurs additional debt. The MADS debt burden on the
series 2019A and 2019B bonds is moderately high, in our view, at 6.9% of fiscal 2018 operating expenses. We would
view additional debt, without additional growth in available resources to support the debt, as a pressuring credit factor.
Management reports that the university was in compliance with all financial covenants at fiscal year-end 2018, and it
expects to be in compliance for fiscal 2019 as well. In addition to the debt, the university has a $10 million revolving
bank line that it uses as working capital, and that does not have a balance as of July 2018. Management has no plans
to issue new debt over the next two years. Contingent liabilities are limited, in our opinion, given the university's fixed
rate debt structure and its retirement plan. The university operates under a defined contribution plan, which is fully
funded by definition; we view this lack of contingent liabilities favorably.
