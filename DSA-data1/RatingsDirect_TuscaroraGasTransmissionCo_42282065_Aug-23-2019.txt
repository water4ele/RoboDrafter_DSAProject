Credit Highlights
Overview
Key Strengths

Key Risks

Highly contracted through 2020.

Single-asset pipeline with limited size and scale.

Strong credit measures and predictable cash flows. Customer concentration with one shipper accounting for 75% of capacity.
Demand is strong in markets with few alternatives. Recontracting risk within 18 months.

Tuscarora serves markets with strong demand, which offsets the pipeline's limited size, scale, and short-term contracts.
The pipeline serves residential and industrial utility customers in northern California and Nevada that we believe have
limited alternative supply sources. We believe this mitigates the relatively short-term weighted average contract (about
three years) and customer concentration.
Tuscarora's credit ratios remain strong despite recent rate reductions. The company negotiated rate reductions in a
settlement with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in May 2019. We expect debt to EBITDA to be in
the 1.5x-1.6x range and funds from operations (FFO) to debt above 55%.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on Tuscarora reflects our outlook on parent TCP. Any rating action on TCP will flow through to
the rating on Tuscarora. The stable outlook on TCP reflects our view that the partnership will have stable cash
flows from a diversified portfolio of pipeline investments. TCP benefits from its strategic link to parent TC Energy,
which brings the 'bbb-' SACP up one notch. We expect the partnership to maintain a debt-to-EBITDA ratio
between 4.0x and 4.5x. We believe there is insufficient separation between TCP and Tuscarora to assess the latter
as an insulated subsidiary, which could have allowed for a rating above the GCP.

Downside scenario
We would lower the rating on TCP if we lowered the rating on TC Energy to 'BBB', unless we assessed TCP's
SACP at least 'bbb'. On a stand-alone basis, we would consider downgrading TCP if debt to EBITDA was above 5x,
which could result from weak volumes, reduced tolls on any of its pipeline assets, or a more aggressive financing
strategy to fund future growth initiatives.

Upside scenario
The most likely route to upgrading TCP would be an upgrade of TC Energy. Absent a TC Energy upgrade, higher
ratings on TCP would only occur if the partnership's SACP was 'bbb+', the rating on TC Energy was at least 'BBB+'
and TCP continued to increase its scale and geographic diversity, maintain a fee-based model, and keep debt to
EBITDA in the 4x area.

Base-case projections
We expect Tuscarora to maintain stable cash flow and strong credit measures in the next few years. We forecast
EBITDA of about $14 million, and financial leverage remains low at about 1.6x, funds from operations to debt above
55%, and interest coverage of at least 10x.

Company Description
Tuscarora is a 305-mile natural gas pipeline that sources gas from the Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN)
interconnect at Malin, Oregon and supplies the key demand markets of Northeast California and Northwest Nevada.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
We base our assessment of Tuscarora's business risk profile on its operations as a single-asset natural gas pipeline,
with limited size and scale and a somewhat captive investment-grade customer base. The company transports natural
gas it receives from Canada's Western Sedimentary Basin and Rocky-Mountain sourced areas via GTN to demand
centers in northern California and Nevada. The majority of Tuscarora's capacity of 230 million cubic feet per day is
contracted with firm reservation charges through 2020. While this raises the possibility of near-term recontracting risk,
we believe the pipeline's demand-pull nature and lack of alternate supply sources for its utility customers adequately
mitigates this risk. Tuscarora's two largest customers are local distribution companies, which are required to maintain
the capacity necessary to meet their peak day utility loads. Sierra Pacific Power Co. represents about 75% of
Tuscarora's firm contracted capacity, with Southwest Gas Corp. at 13% and Barrick Goldstrike Mines Inc. at 9%,
accounting for almost all of the pipeline's total capacity.

Financial Risk: Minimal
Tuscarora's stand-alone financial risk profile is minimal, reflecting strong credit ratios and low financial leverage. We
forecast the company's debt-to-EBITDA ratio will be in the 1.5x-1.6x area and FFO to debt will be between 55%-60%
for the next several years. Tuscarora's capital program is modest, consisting of maintenance spending of less than $1
million annually. We project all free cash flow of about $13.5 million will be distributed to parent TC PipeLines. We
expect scheduled amortization of $1 million per year could result in modest improvements to financial metrics, but we
believe Tuscarora will continue to have a modest amount of debt in its capital structure in consideration of the
rate-making process with the FERC.

Liquidity: Adequate
We view Tuscarora's stand-alone liquidity as adequate. Sources minus uses is positive, as the company can self-fund
its modest capital requirements. Tuscarora does not have a credit facility but will receive support from TCP if needed.
Tuscarora's FFO is forecast to be about $13 million-$15 million and uses include about $1 million of debt amortization,
minimal maintenance capital spending, and most of the remaining available cash distributed to TCP.

Covenant Analysis
Compliance expectations
We expect Tuscarora to have ample cushion under its term loan financial covenants.

Requirements
Tuscarora's $25 million term loan contains a covenant that requires it to maintain a debt service coverage ratio of 3x.
As of March 31, 2019, the ratio was 10.1x. The term loan also contains a maximum debt to capitalization covenant of
45%. As of March 31, 2019, the ratio was about 24%.

Group Influence
We view Tuscarora as core to TCP because we believe it is highly unlikely to be sold, its business is closely aligned
with that of TCP's, and in our view will likely receive support from the group under almost all circumstances. The
assessment, combined with the 'bbb' group credit profile, caps the rating at TCP's group profile. We believe there is
insufficient separation between TCP and Tuscarora to assess the latter as an insulated subsidiary, which could have
allowed for a rating above the GCP.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
Tuscarora's long-term debt consists of an unsecured $25 million term loan facility due 2020 (not rated). The term loan
amortizes $1 million annually and has $24 million outstanding at March 31, 2019.

Analytical conclusions
Tuscarora's term loan is structurally senior to TCP's $1.7 billion unsecured notes but does not affect the partnership's
issue-level rating of 'BBB'.
