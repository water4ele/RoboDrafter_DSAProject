Overview
Key Strengths

Key Risks

Solid operational performance, benefiting from improving mobile market
share in Bahrain coupled with a more favorable regulatory environment,
and No. 1 or No. 2 positions in most markets.

Smaller scale compared with global and regional peers, with
operations in the highly competitive three-player Bahraini telecom
market contributing 40%-45% of company revenues.

Normalization of performance in Bahrain and continued focus on cost
efficiencies supporting our expectation of consistent profitability (about
37% EBITDA margin on an S&P Global Ratings-adjusted basis).

Sizable capital expenditure (capex) due to network upgrades, fiber
rollouts, and license renewals, plus significant dividends (90%-100%
payout ratio), both weigh on discretionary cash flow generation.

Strong balance sheet, despite sizable capital investment (adjusted
debt-to-EBITDA expectation below 1.5x), though upcoming debt maturity
in 2020 will tighten the liquidity cushion significantly until refinanced.

Increased taxes in international portfolio, most noticeably in Jordan.

A very strong link to the Bahraini government (B+/Stable), which
could expose it to extraordinary negative intervention in times of
sovereign stress.

Despite sizable capex plans and dividends, we expect adjusted leverage (net debt to EBITDA) to remain below 1.5x
throughout our forecast period, supported by the company's strong balance sheet and resilient margins. We expect
Bahrain Telecommunications Co.'s (Batelco's) dividend payout will remain 90%-100% of net profit. Also, we anticipate
Batelco's capex requirements will peak in 2019 and 2020 before normalizing at around Bahraini dinar (BHD) 60 million
per year thereafter, due to mobile network and fiber upgrades in Bahrain, and mobile license renewals and spectrum
fees in Bahrain and Jordan. Nevertheless, we view the company's conservative financial policy, resilient EBITDA
margin (around 37%) and net cash position will help retain adjusted leverage below 1.5x (at least until 2021).

Outlook: Stable

S&P Global Ratings' stable outlook on Bahraini integrated telecom operator Batelco mirrors that on Bahrain. It also
reflects our view that Batelco is likely to maintain its operating performance and adjusted debt to EBITDA well
below 2.0x (0.9x for 2018), despite increased capex requirements and high dividends, and liquidity sources to uses
of at least 1x.

Downside scenario
We could lower our rating on Batelco if our liquidity forecast falls below 1x coverage, which could occur if Batelco
underperforms our cash generation forecast over the next quarter or increases spending on capex, and does not
refinance its May 2020 bond maturity or have a credible financing plan in place by November 2019. A downgrade
of Bahrain would also likely lead us to downgrade Batelco, provided our assessment of Batelco's relationship with
the government remains unchanged.

Upside scenario
We could raise our rating on Batelco if the rating on Bahrain was raised, provided our assessment of Batelco's
relationship with the government remains unchanged.

Our Base-Case Scenario

SEPTEMBER 12, 2019 4

Bahrain Telecommunications Co.

Assumptions

• Overall topline growth of 2%-3% for 2019-2020
(compared with 7% in 2018), mainly due to growth
in Bahrain, Jordan, and the Maldives.
• Growth of 3%-5% in Bahrain in 2019-2020,
supported by the company's efforts to grow its
market share and average revenue per user (ARPU)
levels in the mobile and broadband segments. More
specifically, we expect mobile revenues to benefit
from ARPU growth in prepaid due to successful
pricing and product packaging enhancements (such
as shifting from volume-driven packages), in
addition to pre-to-postpaid substitution resulting in
higher postpaid subscribers.

• We expect the company's major capex plans in
mobile network expansion and 5G rollout to fuel
broadband growth, and its upselling strategy to
further increase ARPU growth, in addition to
continued fiber rollout in fixed broadband.
• Stable EBITDA margin (about 37% on an S&P
Global Ratings-adjusted basis), supported by cost
containment initiatives in Bahrain and Jordan, but
partially offset by increasing competition.
• Capex of BHD120 million-BHD130 million in 2019
(compared to BHD48 million in 2018) due to
network and spectrum investments in Bahrain and
solar investment in Jordan. We expect capex will
peak in 2019 before declining to less than BHD70
million in 2020.
• Annual dividends of about BHD55 million,
translating into a a payout ratio of about 90%.
• Proceeds of BHD31.6 million from the 90% stake
sale in Qualitynet, which was completed in May
2019.

Base-case projections
EBITDA margin remaining around 37%, slightly above 2018 levels. This is mainly fueled by topline growth, in addition
to ongoing cost-optimization efforts and a focus on digitization translating into realized efficiencies. In Bahrain, we
expect profitability to decline to a reported 40% in 2019 (from about 43% in 2018), largely due to the costs associated
with the separation of the infrastructure and retail entities. In Jordan, we expect a 2%-3% decline in topline for
2020-2021 to reflect the new mobile termination rates (MTR), but we also anticipate a normalized reported EBITDA
margin at the 30% level. In the Maldives, we expect consistent topline growth of 3%-5% and stable reported margins

of about 50%-52%, supported by growth in subscriber acquisitions, and data and TV.
Capex to sales peaking in 2019 before tapering off to 15% by 2021. We expect the ratio of capex to sales to reach 30%
in 2019, before declining gradually to 15% by 2021. This view reflects the higher network investments in Bahrain due
to 5G rollouts and digitization of the network, fiber rollout in Bahrain, and spectrum and license renewals in Bahrain
and Jordan. We understand that a portion of this capex is discretionary, and could be delayed if there is pressure on
liquidity or budget.

Company Description
Batelco is a Bahrain-based integrated telecom operator providing mobile, fixed telephony, and broadband services
across Bahrain, Jordan, the Maldives, some British islands (including Guernsey, Jersey, and the Isle of Man), and
Yemen (through its 27% shareholding). In May 2019, Batelco announced the completion of the sale of its 90% stake in
Kuwait-based Qualitynet to VIVA Kuwait, a subsidiary of Saudi Telecom Co. Batelco's revenues reached BHD405.9
million ($1.08 billion) in fiscal year ended 31 Dec., 2018, with a total subscriber base of 8.4 million.
The Bahraini government, through three Bahraini-related entities, owns a 77% stake in the group, with the remaining
23% floated on the Bahrain Stock Exchange.

Business Risk: Fair
Batelco's business risk profile assessment primarily reflects our view of the company's solid operating performance and
resilient margins, but balanced by the group's limited scale compared to global and regional peers, and its exposure to
challenges in its international portfolio.
We note Batelco's improving mobile market share in Bahrain (37%), and leading No. 1 and No. 2 position across its
international portfolio. The main constraints on Batelco's business risk profile assessment are the company's fairly
small scale on a global basis, given that the majority of its operational markets have relatively small populations; the
evolving competitive landscape in Bahrain; increased taxes in the international portfolio (namely in Jordan); and its
exposure to country risk.

Batelco enjoys solid profitability (EBITDA margin of around 37%) with strong balance sheet position (adjusted net debt
to EBITDA at about 1.0x).
Compared with Turkish peers, Batelco has lower revenue growth and is much smaller in scale, but has a stronger
balance sheet.
Compared with GCC peers, we see Ooredoo as the closest peer in terms of the stand-alone rating position. We view

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 12, 2019 8

Bahrain Telecommunications Co.

Ooredoo as stronger, given its larger scale and slightly higher profitability, which is mainly a reflection of the
more-favorable competitive landscape in Qatar (a duopoly, compared with Bahrain's three-player market).
Nevertheless, we note that Batelco enjoys a stronger balance sheet (leverage below 1.0x versus Ooredoo's 2.4x-2.6x
ratio), which gives it a better financial standing to withstand the high capex needs and sizable dividends both operators
face.

Financial Risk: Modest
Batelco's financial risk profile is supported by the company's strong balance sheet, with adjusted debt to EBITDA at
less than 1.0x, despite sizable investments in networks, with capex set to reach close to 30% of sales in 2019, and high
dividends (90%-100% of earnings). We expect Batelco will maintain generous dividend distributions of BHD50 million
to BHD55 million. We also forecast negative discretionary cash flow generation, breaking even in 2020 mainly due to
high capex.

Liquidity: Strong
We assess Batelco's liquidity as adequate owing to the company's upcoming bond maturity (May 2020), which reduces
our ratio of liquidity sources to uses to well below 1.5x. Upon successful refinancing, we expect a return to the more
robust liquidity cushion the company has maintained in the past.
The 12-month sources-to-uses ratio starting July 1, 2019 (without bond refinancing, which is only planned for January
2020) is 1.2x. In our view, this is the minimum required for adequate liquidity, and this is achieved by Batelco
through two mitigating factors: we assume about 15% of Batelco's Bahraini dinar (BHD) 86 million capex is
discretionary and can be reduced; and we expect that the company can scale back its April 2020 dividend if needed to
support liquidity.
We understand that the company intends to launch refinancing of its bonds in early 2020. In our view, refinancing to
such a tight deadline could expose it to capital market conditions over a narrow window. Nevertheless, we view such
risk as manageable. This is because Batelco benefits from sizable cash balances (about BHD200 million at July 1,
2019), which can fully cover the May maturities; good bank relationships, especially with local banks; a prudent
balance sheet position with leverage of less than 1x; and a positive growth profile and operating trends. However, we
will likely reassess our view in November 2019, when the bond maturity falls to six months. If a credible refinancing
plan is not in place, and the company continues to invest in its current capex plans, we could lower our assessment to
less than adequate if the cushion falls below 1.2x, though additional tightening or any increase in refinancing risk could
further affect our view of liquidity.
Our 12-month liquidity view as of July 1, 2019 assuming no refinancing, is as follows:

Principal liquidity sources
• Consolidated cash and equivalents of about BHD202 million;
• Undrawn bank lines of about BHD9 million; and
• Funds from operations that we project will be about BHD136 million over the coming 12 months.

Principal liquidity uses
• Debt maturities in 2019 and 2020 of about BHD198 million;
• Annual capex of about BHD73 million for the 12-month period, with an implied haircut of 15% (discretionary capex
spending); and

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 12, 2019 10

Bahrain Telecommunications Co.

• Annual dividends of about BHD16.6 million.
The company is not subject to any financial covenants.
We do not account for share buyback plans announced by the company as it is not a contracted cash outflow, in line
with our criteria.
We are mindful that cash uses may be significantly higher than stated above if acquisition opportunities arise or there
are exceptional dividends, which are not factored into our base case.

Other Credit Considerations
We factor into the rating our negative view of Batelco compared with its rated peers, based on direct and indirect risks
posed by Bahrain's weak fiscal profile, and the company's significant headroom under its financial policy.

Government Influence
We consider Batelco to be a government-related entity (GRE) due to the sovereign's stake of about 77% in the
company. In accordance with our criteria for GREs, our view of a moderately high likelihood of extraordinary
government support is based on our assessment of Batelco's:
• Limited importance for the government, given that increased competition in the Bahraini telecoms market has
resulted in a meaningful market share decline for Batelco. It also reflects our view that the Bahraini telecoms
regulator is independent from the government, especially compared with the majority of other Gulf Cooperation
Council countries, where the introduction of competition has not significantly affected incumbent telecoms
operators. Therefore we believe that the Bahrain government might have less incentive to support Batelco; and
• Very strong link with the government, since the government owns about 77% of the company. Furthermore, the
majority of Batelco's board comprises members of the government.
Given Batelco's very strong link with the government, our rating on Bahrain caps the company's long-term rating
because we believe the government can influence Batelco's financial policy and strategy, as well as industry regulation
or taxation.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
Batelco's capital structure primarily comprises a bond of $473 million (BHD177 million). This represents around 80%
of gross debt, which is raised at parent level.

Analytical conclusions
Since 80% of gross debt is at parent level and Batelco has a strong balance sheet, this should help it offset
subordination risks. Consequently, we rate the bond in line with the issuer credit rating.
