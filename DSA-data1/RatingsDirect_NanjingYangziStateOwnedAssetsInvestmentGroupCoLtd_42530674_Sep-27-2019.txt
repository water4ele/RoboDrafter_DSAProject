Jiangbei District's infrastructure gap with Nanjing metropolitan area underpins Yangzi's continued mandate for sizable
investments. As the largest and most important infrastructure development platform of Jiangbei, the only state level
district in Jiangsu province established in 2015, Nanjing Yangzi State-Owned Assets Investment Group Co. Ltd. will
have significant future investment needs, in our view. Nanjing's recent dual city plan (metropolitan area and Jiangbei),
combined with Jiangbei's short history since 2016 establishment, means a meaningful amount of infrastructure catchup
is still needed to narrow Jiangbei's gap with the metropolitan area of Nanjing.
Nanjing municipal government continues to act as controller of Nanjing Yangzi despite the shareholder change. We
believe Nanjing municipal government remains the ultimate controlling party of Nanjing Yangzi. In our view, Jiangbei
administrative council acts as an extension of Nanjing municipal government, executing its economic and social
objectives, with city mayor and other senior members of the party taking various leadership roles in the council.
The credit profile of Nanjing municipal government continues to underpin that of Nanjing Yangzi. Our assessment of
the credit profile of the Nanjing city government is anchored by our view of the city's vibrant and growing economy.
Nanjing is one of the wealthiest cities in China. The strong economy supports the city's very strong budgetary
performance. Even though Nanjing lacks the flexibility to adjust its revenue generation mechanism like all other
Chinese local governments, this is mitigated by its above-average capability to generate revenues from asset sales.
Lastly, Nanjing has very high debt burden with large LGFV sector that carries out the infrastructure projects. Given the
central government's continued efforts to deleverage and focus on quality growth, we expect the city to stay vigilant in
controlling its debt accumulation going forward.

Nanjing Yangzi's deep involvement in the city's shanty town renovation program reflects its importance to the
government. As the only LGFV representing the Nanjing government for Shanty-town renovation borrowing, Nanjing
Yangzi takes loans from China Development Bank (CDB) for the entire city's shanty-town renovation program. As of
end 2018, the company has drawn down Chinese renminbi (RMB) 27.5 billion 25-year low cost debt from CDB, of
which RMB26.1 billion has been lent on to other LGFVs of Nanjing.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on Nanjing Yangzi reflects our view of the stable credit profile of the Nanjing municipal
government over the coming two years. We expect that Nanjing will maintain a solid and above-average economic
growth in the forecasted horizon, which will continue to be reflected on its budgetary performance.

Downside scenario
We could downgrade Nanjing Yangzi if the likelihood of receiving extraordinary government support significantly
weakens, possibly due to a change in the government's strategies or priorities. Loosened government control, the
company's expansion in non-infrastructure related businesses, or a significant reduction in the government's
ownership could indicate declining commitment of support. Heightened policy risk, which may prevent the
municipal government from providing extraordinary support in a timely manner, would also trigger a downward
rating action.
We could also lower the rating if the creditworthiness of the Nanjing municipal government materially deteriorates.
This could happen if:
• Nanjing's economy weakens materially from the current level, leading to structural and persistent deterioration
of the budgetary performance, or
• The government's contingent liability exposure rises notably or the SOEs' performances deteriorate
substantially, leading to heightened likelihood of risk materialization.

Upside scenario
We may upgrade Nanjing Yangzi if the creditworthiness of the Nanjing city government materially improves, in our
view. This could happen if the government is able to reduce its debt burden substantially from the current level in a
sustainable manner.

• Its EBITDA margin to be 15%-20% over 2019 and

• The company's capital expenditure and working
capital combined net outlays to remain elevated at
RMB15 billion–RMB20 billion each year in 2019 and
2020.
• The parent government's ongoing support in the
form of equity injection to be around RMB3
billion-RMB5 billion per year.
• No dividend payment.
• Weighted average cost of debt to be around 5.1%.

Base-case projections
Operating cash out flows are set to remain substantial driven by infrastructure spending and interest expense.Given
Nanjing Yangzi's long project pipelines, we expect the company to spend RMB15 billion-RMB20 billion each year on
infrastructure investments in 2019 and 2020. We also expect high interest expense of RMB6 billion-RMB7 billion per
year, given its sheer size of debt.
Infrastructure investment funds de facto borrowings are likely to remain high in the next 12-18 months.A sizable
portion of Nanjing Yangzi's minority shareholdings are accrued from its infrastructure investment funds. As of
end-2018, the total fund size has reached RMB21 billion, of which RMB17.8 billion was funded by various financial
institutions acting as limited partners. Such exposure is unlikely to shrink over the next two years, given Nanjing
Yangzi's significant investment needs.
Debt growth is set to outpace that of operating profits. We expect Nanjing Yangzi's leverage--measured as funds from
operations (FFO) in relation to debt--will remain negative, due to the not-for profit nature of the company's
investments.

Company Description
Nanjing Yangzi is a local government financing-vehicle (LGFV) focused on developing the Jiangbei New District of
Nanjing, Jiangsu, China. The company is the dominant platform in the district for infrastructure construction, primary
land development, affordable housing, and utility service. Nanjing Yangzi also serves as the only financing vehicle for

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 25, 2019 5

Nanjing Yangzi State-Owned Assets Investment Group Co. Ltd.

redevelopment of shanty towns in Nanjing city. It is 100% owned by the Nanjing city government.

Business Risk: Weak
In our opinion, Nanjing Yangzi's business is highly dependent on the government's infrastructure plan. Due to the
economic and political importance of Jiangbei district, the company has rapidly increased its infrastructure
investments over the past few years. Nanjing Yangzi has high geographical concentration, and a limited customer base
and product diversification. The reliance on the government also limits the company's working capital management.
The local government has a significant say in the settlement of receivables.
Nanjing Yangzi's not-for-profit position for public projects also anchors its weak profitability. The gross margin in
infrastructure investments is generally low at 10%-15%. For affordable housing, profit only comes from ancillary
commercial attachments, and the company is permitted to sell only a limited number of units to the market. In
addition, the price adjustments on Nanjing Yangzi's distributed electricity, water, and steam has been slow and under
the government's tight control. Lastly, despite the hike in Jiangbei's land premiums over the past three years, visibility
on the pace of land transactions is low due to macroeconomic and other unforeseeable reasons.
Nevertheless, we expect Nanjing Yangzi to remain the only dominant LGFV closely controlled by the Nanjing
municipal government within the district. The risk of it being replaced is therefore low. This status underpins the
company's monopoly in each of its major business sectors. Nanjing Yangzi has grown rapidly in the past few years and
was the largest LGFV in Nanjing as of end 2018.

We consider Changsha Pilot Investment Holdings Co. Ltd. and Jinan West City Investment and Development Group
Co. Ltd. as close peers of Nanjiang Yangzi. They are all China-based LGFVs and share similar business models in
provincial capitals.
All three companies' financial risk profiles are highly leveraged, burdened by sizable capital expenditure for expansion
and subdued operating cash flows. This largely reflects the respective governments' ambitious infrastructure
development plans and not-for-profit business nature.
We expect government support flow through from Jinan West City's parent to remain robust, as its key undertakings
still carry high level of policy importance. In our view, Changsha Pilot's extremely high likelihood of support is subject
to transitional weakening over time. This is because the company is likely to gradually transform its business to be
more market oriented.

Financial Risk: Highly leveraged
Nanjing Yangzi's financial risks are the main constraints to its credit profile. We anticipate that the company will incur
negative FFO of RMB5 billion-RMB6 billion per year due to its high interest expenses. Such outlay, together with the
high debt load in the absence of substantial asset sale, underpins Nanjing Yangzi's very high financial leverage.
We anticipate that infrastructure investments will continue to fuel growth in Nanjing Yangzi's financial leverage over
the next 24 months. Its key investments over the coming two years include S8 metro line, Jiangbei financial center,
high-speed rail train station area, and shanty town redevelopment. These projects require heavy upfront investments
but take a long to recover costs. In our view, the company has low control over its working capital, including
government related receivables and inventory accumulated from infrastructure projects that have yet to be settled.

Liquidity: Adequate
We assess Nanjing Yangzi's liquidity as adequate. The company's sources of liquidity is set to exceed uses by more
than 20% in 2019. In our view, the company has solid relationships with major state-owned banks, benefiting from its
status as the most important investment platform of Jiangbei district. The company also possesses strong access to the
capital market.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

We assess Nanjing Yangzi's carbon and land use footprint as moderate. Under the government mandate, the
company carries out sewage water treatment, water drainage upgrade, historical tourism site reservation, and
ecological protection forest projects in the Jiangbei area. We do not see material impact of land use issue on
Nanjing Yangzi's credit profile in the coming two years as the company's pace of primary land development has
been moderating.
In our view, Nanjing Yangzi's exposure to social factors is mainly associated with its role in shanty town
development and its operation in the Nanjing chemical park. The company acts as the financing platform for entire
city's shanty town redevelopment programs, and it also directly manages and constructs such program in the
Jiangbei area. While shanty town development benefits many low income households, the resettlement issue
sometimes might cause frictions with residents. Besides, Nanjing Yangzi manages a chemical park with established
safety track record and most tenants are large corporations compliant with environmental standards. That said, the
costs of operating the chemical park could increase as China raise its environmental protection standard.
The company's management and governance is fair, in our view. As a state-owned enterprise supervised by the
Nanjing State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), its government practice is
largely consistent with other SOE groups in China's major cities. Also similar to its peers, the transparency and
disclosure of Nanjing Yangzi is limited and insufficient.

Government Influence
We see an extremely high likelihood of extraordinary support from the Nanjing municipal government to Nanjing
Yangzi if the company comes under financial stress. Our view is based on the following company characteristics:
• Very important role. Jiangbei district has strong social, political, and economic importance to Nanjing. It's the only
state-level district of Jiangsu province and is considered the gateway for accelerating the development of north
Jiangsu. The district's administrative committee profile, which includes Nanjing party secretory, mayor, and
members of the provincial standing committee, reflects such importance. Nanjing Yangzi essentially operates on
behalf of the government in providing key public infrastructure investments for Jiangbei. It's also Nanjing's
centralized borrower for policy bank loans targeted for shanty-town redevelopment. Nanjing Yangzi's mandates are
unlikely to be undertaken by private entities due to their not-for profit nature.
• Integral link. The Nanjing municipal government, via the Administrative Committee of Jiangbei New District, fully
owns Nanjing Yangzi. The municipal government drives the company's development strategy, closely monitors its
operations, and appoints its senior management. We expect no dilution in government ownership over the next
several years. The government has a record of providing ongoing support to the company, including subsidies, asset
injections, and debt-for-bond swaps.
We expect a gradual strengthening of Nanjing Yangzi's role in supporting Nanjing to meet its economic, social, and

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 25, 2019 10

Nanjing Yangzi State-Owned Assets Investment Group Co. Ltd.

political objectives. This is reflected in the company's rapid growth in asset size, expansion of business scope, and
consolidation of assets of other SOEs in Jiangbei district. Moreover, Nanjing Yangzi has started taking the financing
role for tunnels, metro lines, and bridges, which are key projects that integrate Jiangbei with the Nanjing metropolitan
area.
Strong ongoing support from the government and the potential upside from monetizing Nanjing Yangzi's land holdings
support our assessment of a positive comparable rating analysis.
In our view, strong support from the Nanjing government benefits Nanjing Yangzi's credit standing. Such potential
support includes, but is not limited to, asset injections, preferential support in obtaining low cost finding, allocation of
special-purpose bond proceedings, and structuring hidden debt. Moreover, the price of Nanjing Yangzi's land obtained
from the shanty-town program has substantially appreciated amid the property upcycle over the past three years.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
As of end-2018, Nanjing Yangzi had RMB125 billion reported debt in total, of which 24% was secured debt.

Analytical conclusions
We rate Nanjing Yangzi's senior unsecured U.S. dollar denominated bond 'BBB+', equalized with the issuer credit
rating. This reflects our view of insignificant subordination risk on the U.S. dollar bond. In the event of debt
restructuring, the local government is likely to heavily intervene, so that the U.S. dollar bond holders will not be
necessarily disadvantaged compared with other creditors.
