Key Strengths

Key Risks

Monopolistic and vertically integrated electricity business in its core
market in Hong Kong.

Lower profitability for Hong Kong business due to reduction of
permitted return to 8% from 9.99%.

Longer term and more timely fuel-cost adjustment under new Scheme of
Control starting January 2019.

Higher business risks for unregulated power generation businesses
outside of Hong Kong.

Transparent and predictable regulations for the Hong Kong business.

Contribution from Australian business turned more volatile.

Goodwill impairment not affecting cash earnings. CLP Holdings Ltd. reported a goodwill impairment of about Hong
Kong dollar (HK$) 6 billion at EnergyAustralia Holdings Ltd. along with its 2019 interim results. Given the impairment
loss, the company had a net loss was HK$907 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, compared with net
profit of HK$7.4 billion in the same period last year. A noncash adjustment is required by the new federal government
policy, and has a limited impact on CLPH's financial ratio. We do not expect an additional impairment or
policy-related loss to be recognized beyond the amount reported in the first half.
Earnings from Australian market under near-term pressure. We anticipate that the returns from the Australia retail
market will be negatively affected due to the new regulation. The Australian federal government's default market offer
and the Victoria default offer, which took effect on July 1, 2019, will set a maximum default price that retailers can
charge for electricity in regions serviced by EnergyAustralia In addition, the Australian subsidiary's ongoing
maintenance at Yallourn plant and coal quality issues at its Mount Piper power plant may negatively affect its 2019
performance.
Lowered rate of return in Hong Kong. Under the new Scheme of Control Agreement (SCA) starting from January 2019,
the permitted return on assets was lowered to 8% from 9.99%. Profitability from Hong Kong business would be
negatively affected over the next one to two years. The lengthened term of the new SCA to 15 years provides higher
visibility to the company's cash generation and regulatory regime. In addition, the new scheme allows for timely
pass-through of actual fuel costs. This could help company to adjust fuel costs more frequently and is positive for its
working capital management.

Greener development for Greater China and other markets. CLPH is focusing on developing clean energy in
Asia-Pacific to achieve its "Climate Vision 2050." The company's construction of gas-fired power plants in Hong Kong
follows the government's target of reducing carbon intensity and increasing gas-fired power generation to 50% of the
fuel mix in 2020. In the mainland China market, all of the company's newly added capacity are renewable projects
such as wind and solar power. The operation of Unit 5 and 6 Yangjiang nuclear power plant in July 2018 and July
2019 will further contribute to dividends received from equity investment in 2019. The company is also exploring more
low-carbon emission projects in India after its introduction of Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec as a strategic
partner in 2018. In July 2019, CLP India entered into an agreement to buy 100% equity stake of three Indian
transmission and distribution assets.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our view that CLPH's focus on organic growth will stabilize its financial performance
over the next 24 months, and the company will maintain a steady debt level. We expect CLPH's ratio of funds from
operations (FFO) to debt to be 38%-43% during 2019-2021.
The outlook also reflects a minimal likelihood of material mergers and acquisitions by CLP Holdings over the next
two to three years.

Downside scenario
We could lower the rating if CLPH's ratio of FFO to debt approaches 30% with no prospect of recovery. The
deteriorating performance of the company's Australia and mainland China businesses could also lead to a
downgrade. In addition, we could lower the rating if CLPH makes material debt-funded acquisitions or
investments, or adopts a more aggressive financial policy that weakens its financial strength without prospects for
recovery.

Upside scenario
We could raise the rating if CLPH's ratio of FFO-to-debt is above 40% on a sustainable basis. This could occur if
leverage reduced faster than we expected because of the better performance of overseas operations or through
sale of assets.

Assumptions

Key Metrics

Our base case assumes the following:
Debt/EBITDA (x)

• Hong Kong's GDP will grow 2.2% in 2019 and 2.4%
in 2020 from 3.0% in 2018, leading to stable growth
in electricity demand.
• Australia's GDP will grow 2.2% in 2019 and 2.5% in
2020. However, we expect CLPH's revenues from
Australia to decline slightly due to new regulations
in the retail market.

• India's GDP will grow at 6.6% in 2019 and 7.8% in
2020. We expect double-digit decline for CLP India
due to lower thermal earnings and lower wind
generation.
• CLPH's overall EBITDA margin to decline slightly to
28%-29% during 2019-2021, compared with 30.7%
in 2018, mainly driven by the implementation of
new SoC in Hong Kong.
• The company will not make material acquisitions
over the next one to two years.

Base-case projections
• We assume capital expenditure of HK$11.0 billion-HK$11.5 billion in 2019 and HK$13.4 billion in 2020, mainly for
building assets under Scheme of Control.
• We assume a stable cash dividend of HK$8 billion-HK$9 billion during 2019-2020. There is no dividend policy, but
we expect slow growth of less than 10% each year in dividends, consistent with the past record.
• The dividends from joint ventures are also in line with the management expectations of HK$1.9 billion-HK$2.0
billion in 2019 and 2020, taking into consideration the full-year contribution from Unit 5 of the Yangjiang nuclear
project in 2019.
• We expect CLPH to grow by shifting its focus from fossil fuel-generated electricity to wind and solar power in
China.

Company Description
CLPH, via its 100%-owned subsidiary, CLP Power Hong Kong, is one of two vertically integrated power suppliers in
Hong Kong. It is also one of the largest power utilities in Asia-Pacific, with power assets in Australia, India, China,
Taiwan, and Southeast Asia.

Business Risk: Strong
We expect CLPH to maintain its de facto monopoly for electricity distribution in Kowloon and the New Territories in
Hong Kong. The Hong Kong business benefits from a transparent and predictable regulatory framework that allows the
company to generate highly visible and stable operating cash flows through a permitted rate of return and cost
pass-through mechanism. The core and regulated utility business in Hong Kong has stable power demand and good
operating efficiency.
In our view, the new SCA ensures CLPH a stable but lower permitted rate of return for longer term. Under the new
regime, permitted return has been lowered to 8% from 9.99%, which will weaken company's cash flow generation.
However, the new SCA extends term to 15 years, compared with 10 years in the previous regulatory cycle.
The new regime also allows more timely pass-through mechanism. Monthly adjustments to fuel costs is based on the
average price of the past three months, shortened from 12 months previously. The consistent and transparent
regulatory climate could protect CLPH's cash flow volatility.
Somewhat tempering these strengths are CLPH's exposure to unregulated generation operations outside Hong Kong.
These businesses are subject to uncertainty in power demand and supply, fuel availability, and cost pass-through, and
governments' environment policy.
We expect CLPH's 100%-owned subsidiary, EnergyAustralia, to decline slightly in 2019 as prices soften. The
contribution from Australia to CLP Holdings' EBITDA has steadily increased to 25% in 2018, from 21% in 2017.
Wholesale prices for electricity in Australia were high for most of the 2018 but heightened competition stimulated by
government intervention have led to declining mass-market customers. In addition, EnergyAustralia gas sales volume
to commercial and industrial customers has slowed due to reduced gas supply.

CLP Holdings Ltd.

In our view, CLPH's mainland China business will continue to grow in 2019. The company's stake in Yangjiang nuclear
power plant contributed to first full-year cash flows in 2018. Over the past year, the company continued to expand its
non-carbon energy portfolio and acquired Jinchang solar and Meizhou Solar. In addition, grid curtailment has reduced
for wind in the northeast and solar in the northwest.

CLPH's closest peer is Power Assets Holdings Ltd., which invests in another regulated utility, Hongkong Electric Co.
Ltd., in Hong Kong. Both CLPH and Power Assets have significant interests in Hong Kong's regulated business and
seek growth by expanding outside Hong Kong. However, they follow different investment strategies. Power Assets has

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 16, 2019 7

CLP Holdings Ltd.

focused on power and regulated utility assets in developed markets with stable regulatory regimes, whereas CLPH has
invested more in unregulated power generation assets in Asia-Pacific.
In our view, Power Assets has a stronger business risk profile and financial risk profile than CLPH. However, the rating
on Power Assets is capped at the 'a-' group credit profile of Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Ltd.

Financial Risk: Modest
We expect CLPH to continue to generate strong cash flow. This is despite negative policy and declining profit
contributions in Australia as well as lower regulated returns in Hong Kong from 2019 onwards.
We expect CLPH's stake in joint ventures and associates to contribute dividends of HK$1.9 billion in 2019 and HK$2
billion in 2020. This should temper the negative impact of the implementation of the new SCA between the company
and the Hong Kong government.
In our view, CLP Holdings' sound and stable regulated businesses in Hong Kong will underpin its financial
performance over the next two years. We have not assumed any material asset sales or unannounced acquisitions. We
expect the company to maintain its FFO-to-debt ratio at above 35% in 2019-2021, compared with 43% in 2018.

Liquidity: Adequate
We assess CLPH as having adequate liquidity. The company's liquidity sources should exceed its uses by more than
1.1x over the next 12 months. Net liquidity sources should remain positive even if EBITDA declines by 10%, and the
company would still be in compliance with its financial covenants.
CLPH has good financial flexibility, benefiting from its strong and cash-generative utility business in Hong Kong, and
the group's strong access to banking facilities.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Cash and cash equivalents of about HK$12.1 billion
as of Dec. 31, 2018.

• Debt of HK$13.5 billion maturing in 2019.

• Undrawn committed credit facilities of about HK$4
billion maturing beyond 12 months.
• FFO of about HK$21.8 billion for 2019.

• Net working capital outflow that we estimate at
HK$300 million–HK$320 million during the year.
• Committed capital expenditure of HK$11

Other Credit Considerations
We anticipate that the company's FFO-to-debt ratio will be at the weak end of the modest range over 2019-2020. We
reflect this in our negative comparable rating analysis, leading to a one-notch downward adjustment to the anchor in
deriving the stand-alone rating of CLPH.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

Environmental and social factors are the chief credit considerations for CLPH. As a vertically integrated electric
utility, CLP generates, transmits, and distributes electricity to over 80% of Hong Kong's population. Its generation
comprises 38% coal power, 26% gas power, and 35% nuclear power, which is imported from China. It's critical for
CLP to maintain a safe and reliable power supply in its service area, which is key to managing regulatory risks and
public opinion.
To support Hong Kong's initiative of having 75% of power sourced from clean energy by 2030, CLP will gradually
retire its coal-fired units with gas-fired power plants and will promote the usage of renewable energy such as
landfill gas power generation, distributed solar photovoltaics, and green certificates. The government approved
capital expenditures for new gas-fired generation units and landfill gas power generation project in the five-year
development plan, which earn 8.0% permitted returns. In addition, costs of purchasing renewables with higher
feed-in tariffs can be passed through. Outside Hong Kong, CLP also invests in power generation assets primarily in
Australia, India, and mainland China.
Traditional power is currently the dominant fuel type in its asset portfolio, but CLP is trying to add more renewable
energy according to its Climate Vision 2050, and comply with each market's local environmental and carbon
emissions policy.
The company generally maintains a satisfactory operational track record and keeps improving its service quality.
We assess CLP's management and governance as strong, reflecting management's strong strategic planning, risk
management, and expertise, experience, and operational effectiveness. In addition, as a listed company in Hong
Kong, the company maintains sound corporate governance practices and disclosures.
