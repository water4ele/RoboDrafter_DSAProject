Dominant market position with diverse assets and revenue streams.

Sensitivity to inherent cyclicality in the oil industry.

Large and highly integrated operations.
Extremely high likelihood of extraordinary support from the Chinese government.

Well-integrated operations with diverse assets help China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (Sinopec Corp.) maintain its
competitive advantage. Sinopec Corp. has good vertical integration with presence in upstream, refining,
petrochemical, and distribution operations. This helps mitigate cyclical risks in the industry and generate more stable
cash flows compared with pure upstream peers. In 2018, for example, the company's earnings in the refining and
downstream segments fell but it maintained steady operating cash flows as higher oil prices boosted its upstream
segment.
Sinopec Corp.'s dominant position in China's oil refining and marketing industry bolsters its business strength. Sinopec
Corp. is China's biggest producer of refined oil and petrochemical products and one of the largest globally. The
company processed 244 million tons of crude oil in 2018, accounting for 40% of China's total refinery throughput.
Sinopec Corp. has over 30,000 gas stations, or 30% of China's total, making it the largest distributor of refined products
in the country. Due to its well-located gas stations, Sinopec Corp. accounted for about 55% of China's oil product sales
volume in 2018. In addition, the company's refineries are located in China's more affluent coastal areas, which gives it
an edge in demand and transportation. Sinopec Corp.'s market leadership on the back of these characteristics has
enabled the company to maintain steady profitability.
Sinopec Corp.'s earnings will remain vulnerable to lower oil refining margins and crude oil price volatility. In 2018,
Sinopec Corp.'s operating profits in its refining, petrochemical, and marketing segments slumped due to the sizable
negative inventory impact as oil prices slumped in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, the company's overall earnings
remained steady because of considerably narrowed operating losses in its upstream business. However, we believe the
company's earnings will decline in 2019 and 2020 as upstream segment losses widen based on our assumption of
lower oil prices. In addition, we expect oil refining margins to be muted, weighed down by softer global demand amid

capacity expansions.

Significant capital outlay is expected to lead to negative discretionary cash flows. The Chinese government has called
for higher capital expenditure (capex) by the three national oil companies (NOCs) in domestic exploration and
production (E&P). We therefore expect Sinopec Corp.'s capex to increase in 2019 and remain high over the subsequent
years. Given that the capex will take time to translate into operating cash flow, we estimate Sinopec Corp.'s
discretionary cash flow will be negative in 2019 and 2020. That said, the company has considerable rating buffer and
can absorb the incremental spending.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on Sinopec Corp. reflects the outlook on the sovereign credit rating on China. The outlook also
reflects the extremely high likelihood of extraordinary support from the Chinese government to Sinopec Corp.,
given its strategic position as one of the largest NOCs in China. We also expect Sinopec Corp.'s financial
performance to remain relatively stable in the next 12-24 months given its integrated operations.

Downside scenario
We will downgrade Sinopec Corp. if we lower the sovereign credit rating.
We may also downgrade Sinopec Corp. if its ratio of debt to EBITDA rises above 2.5x, possibly due to: (1) higher
capex than we expect or large-scale debt-funded acquisitions; or (2) very low oil prices, leading to significant losses
in the upstream business, or a significant increase in oil price in a short period of time, leading to significant losses
in the refining business.

Upside scenario
We will upgrade Sinopec Corp. if we raise the sovereign credit rating.

Assumptions

• China's GDP growth to moderate to 6.2% in
2019-2020 from 6.6% in 2018. Slower economic
growth and China's shift toward a more
consumption-based economy will lower oil
consumption growth. This will result in falling diesel
demand, which is driven by industrial activities,
while gasoline and kerosene consumption will rise,
supported by a growing auto fleet, albeit at a slower
pace, and an increase in passenger and cargo flights.

• Brent oil price per barrel to average US$60 for the
rest of 2019 and in 2020, and US$55 in 2021, down
from US$72 in 2018. This is based on slower
demand growth and rising production, especially in
the U.S. However, oil prices could increase on
continued OPEC production cuts and geopolitical
events.
• Oil production to fall by 0.5% per year in 2019 and
2020, from 289 million barrels in 2018. Gas
production to grow by 4.5% in 2019 and 4.0% in
2020, from 977 billion cubic feet in 2018. We expect
faster growth for natural gas owing to constraints in
Sinopec Corp.'s oil reserves and the company's plan
to ramp up its gas production, especially in the
Sichuan basin.
• Refinery throughput to grow by 1.0% per annum in
2019 and 2020 from 244 million tons in 2018. This is
at a weaker pace than in prior years mainly because
of China's slowing demand growth for oil products.
• Gross refining margin of US$9 per barrel in 2019 and
2020, down from US$9.49 per barrel in 2018, due to
falling oil prices and rising supply versus demand.
We have not factored in any potential positive
impact from the implementation of the International
Maritime Organization's new sulfur restriction on
marine fuel from 2020.

Base-case projections
Sinopec Corp.'s revenue to decline by 10%-13% in 2019 and 3%-5% in 2020. The drop in revenue will be primarily
driven by lower Brent oil prices, which we estimate will fall by 12.5% in 2019 and 4.8% in 2020 on a full-year average
basis.

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 24, 2019 6

China Petroleum & Chemical Corp.

Adjusted EBITDA margins to increase to 8%-9% in the next 12-24 months from 7.9% in 2018, because of a lower
revenue base on lower oil prices. However, the company's absolute adjusted EBITDA will decrease to Chinese
renminbi (RMB) 210 billion-RMB220 billion in 2019 and 2020 from RMB228 billion in 2018, owing to our assumptions
of lower crude oil prices and refining margins.
Leverage to increase slightly as a result of higher capital spending over the next two years. We expect Sinopec Corp.'s
annual capex to increase to RMB130 billion-RMB140 billion over the next 12-24 months from RMB103 billion in 2018.
This is in response to the Chinese government's directive to increase domestic oil and gas production for energy
security. Consequently, we expect the company to generate negative discretionary cash flows, leading to an increase
in the debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 1.1x-1.3x in 2019 and 2020, from 0.9x in 2018.

Company Description
Sinopec Corp. is the key operating subsidiary of China Petrochemical Corp. (Sinopec Group). It accounted for about
99% of Sinopec Group's revenues and 78% of its reported assets in 2018. Sinopec Corp. operates in five business
segments: oil and gas exploration and production, refining, marketing, chemicals, and trading and research.
Given the strategic importance of the petroleum industry, we believe the Chinese government will continue to
maintain its majority ownership in Sinopec Corp., through parent Sinopec Group.

Business Risk: Strong
We believe Sinopec Corp.'s large and well-integrated operations with diverse assets and revenue streams, dominant
market position in the downstream segment, and well-established marketing and distribution network in China
underpin the company's strong business position. However, these benefits are partially offset by the cyclical risk in oil
and gas because the industry's performance is highly dependent on fluctuations in crude oil prices.
As one of China's three NOCs and the largest downstream operator, Sinopec Corp. contributes to about 40% of the
total crude oil processed in the country. However, Sinopec Corp.'s own crude oil production can only meet less than
one-fifth of its refining capacity. Hence, over the past few years, the company has increased its investments in the
upstream segment, mainly in cleaner natural gas, which is in line with China's national goal of increasing use of clean
energy compared to crude oil.
Losses at Sinopec Corp.'s E&P segment narrowed materially to RMB10 billion in 2018 from RMB46 billion in 2017 due
to the recovery in oil prices. Realized oil prices rose to US$65 per barrel in 2018 from US$49 per barrel in 2017, in line
with Brent oil prices. We expect operating losses at the company's E&P segment to widen to RMB20 billion-RMB 30
billion based on our assumption of declining oil prices in 2019 and 2020.
Profits at the company's downstream segment will remain under pressure over the next 12-24 months, in our view.
Operating profit at the company's refining business plummeted to RMB55 billion in 2018 from RMB65 billion in 2017,
due to the negative inventory impact triggered by a sharp fall in crude oil prices in the fourth quarter. We expect
refining earnings to remain relatively stable at RMB50 billion-RMB55 billion in 2019 and 2020 as incremental industry
supply growth will outpace demand.
Operating profits at Sinopec Corp.'s marketing segment plunged to RMB24 billion in 2018 from RMB32 billion in 2017
because of the sizable negative inventory impact along with stiff competition from independent refiners in China. In
our view, the lower margins were attributable to discounts offered in response to competition from independent
station operators. We anticipate this intense competition to weigh on the segment's performance, leading to flat
earnings of RMB24 billion-RMB 25 billion over the next two years.
Operating profits at the company's chemical segment remained flat at RMB27 billion in 2018 as increases in average
selling prices and sales volumes were offset by higher feedstock cost following the rise in crude oil prices. We expect
chemical spreads to remain flat over the next 12-24 months owing to rising global capacity and subdued demand. As
such, we forecast earnings to slow to RMB28 billion-RMB30 billion.

We have selected the other two Chinese NOCs, China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC) and China National Offshore
Oil Corp. (CNOOC), as Sinopec Corp.'s domestic peers. We have also chosen international oil companies BP PLC,
Exxon Mobil Corp., and Royal Dutch Shell PLC as the global peers.
We believe Sinopec Corp.'s business position is comparable to CNOOC's but weaker than CNPC's and its global peers'.
This is because Sinopec Corp. has a smaller reserve base and shorter reserve life. Sinopec Corp.'s total oil and gas
reserve was 2.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe), smaller than CNOOC's 5.0 billion boe and PetroChina Co. Ltd.'s
(CNPC's flagship subsidiary) 20.8 billion. Sinopec Corp.'s reserve life as of 2018 was 5.9 years, lower than PetroChina's

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 24, 2019 9

China Petroleum & Chemical Corp.

13.7 years and CNOOC's 10.5 years.
CNPC and CNOOC benefited from increasing oil prices in 2018 on the back of their large exposure to the upstream
segment. As a result, the two NOCs recorded strong net profit growth, while Sinopec Corp., being a downstream
major, reported much lower net profit growth in 2018. However, we believe Sinopec Corp.'s integrated business will
lead to relatively stable cash flows compared with the other NOCs over the next two years as we expect oil prices to
decline; this was demonstrated by Sinopec Corp.'s more resilient earnings in the last downturn in 2015-2016.
Sinopec Corp.'s financial strength is on par with the other two Chinese NOCs' and comparable to its international peers
due to its well-integrated operations and diverse assets. All major oil companies have been cautious about costs and
active in cutting capex and operating expenses in response to falling oil prices.
All the three NOCs--CNPC, Sinopec Corp., and CNOOC--are government-related entities as they are 100% owned by
the Chinese central government. BP and Shell are publicly traded private companies and do not receive government
support. We assess CNPC, Sinopec Corp., and CNOOC as having extremely high likelihood of receiving extraordinary
government support. This is because oil and gas are strategic reserves and these three companies are the only NOCs
with a dominant position in the oil and gas value chain. We apply a one-notch uplift to both CNOOC and Sinopec
Corp. in view of potential government support, while CNPC's issuer credit rating is constrained by the sovereign credit
rating on China given its 'aa-' stand-alone credit profile.

Financial Risk: Modest
We believe Sinopec Corp. will maintain its robust, albeit slightly increasing, leverage position on the back of its
significant cash balance over the next 12-24 months.
Sinopec Corp. has significantly improved its financial strength by aggressively reducing its operating costs and capex
since oil prices slumped in 2015. In view of the efforts, the company's leverage, determined by the debt-to-EBITDA
ratio, improved to 0.9x in 2018 from 2.6x in 2014, while its cash balance rose to RMB193 billion in 2018 from RMB10
billion in 2014.
Under our base case, we expect Sinopec Corp.'s capex to increase to RMB130 billion-RMB140 billion in 2019 and
2020, in line with management guidance, from about RMB103 billion in 2018. We also expect the company's dividend
payments to remain at RMB40 billion-RMB55 billion over that period. Given our view of declining oil prices over the
next two to three years, we believe the company's operating cash flows will be insufficient to fully accommodate its
capex requirements and dividend payments, resulting in negative discretionary cash flows and a mild increase in
leverage.

Having said that, we believe Sinopec Corp.'s strong cash balance will help the company sustain its robust, albeit
slightly deteriorating, credit metrics over the next two to three years. Given the company's cash balance of about
RMB193 billion as of the beginning of 2019, we expect adjusted debt to grow moderately and leverage to sustain at
healthy levels. As such, we expect the ratio of debt to EBITDA to remain at 1.1x-1.3x over the next two to three years,
compared to 0.9x in 2019.

Liquidity: Adequate
We assess Sinopec Corp.'s liquidity as adequate because we expect the company's liquidity sources to exceed its uses
by about 1.2x over the next 12 months. Net liquidity sources should remain positive even if EBITDA declines by 15%.
We expect the group to retain its strong access to banks and debt capital markets.
As of June 30, 2019, Sinopec Corp. had total banking facilities of RMB388 billion. Only RMB24 billion was used, while
RMB364 billion remains unused, demonstrating strong support from banks.
In addition, with about RMB180 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2019, we believe the company is
able to absorb high-impact, low-probability events.

Covenant Analysis
Sinopec Corp. does not have any major financial covenants in its bank loans and other borrowings.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

As one of China's three NOCs, Sinopec Corp. is responsible for meeting environmental protection targets set by the
Chinese government. Sinopec Corp. announced its Green Corporate Action Plan in April 2018, with the aim of
making the company a "clean, efficient, low-carbon, and recycling" green corporation by 2023. Specific targets
include energy conservation of 6 million tons of standard coal and an 18% reduction in sulfur dioxide. Sinopec
Corp. has not experienced very severe environmental issues since an oil pipeline exploded in Shandong province
in late 2013 because of a leak. There have been fires at refineries but the financial impact has been insignificant.
The company spent RMB7.9 billion (about US$1.2 billion) on environmental protection in 2017. It also supplied the
Chinese domestic market with national standard (NS) V (equivalent to Euro V) gasoline and diesel in 2017 and NS
VI in 28 cities in northern China from September 2017 as required by the government. At the same time, Sinopec
Corp. is promoting and developing biojet fuel and biodiesel in China. Sinopec's biojet fuel was put into commercial
use in 2017 and its B5 biodiesel was launched in Shanghai in October 2017.

Government Influence
Sinopec Corp. is the core and most valuable operating subsidiary of Sinopec Group, which is one of the three NOCs in
China fully owned by the government. We see an extremely high likelihood of extraordinary support from the Chinese
government directly to the company. Our view is based on the following assessments:
• Critical role to the government: Sinopec Corp. plays a key role in ensuring a secured supply of energy to meet
growing domestic demand. Limited private ownership in the oil and gas industry in China solidifies the company's
critical role.
• Very strong link with the government: The Chinese government owns 100% of Sinopec Group through the
State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC). Sinopec Group controlled about 68.31%
of Sinopec Corp. as of Dec. 31, 2018. We believe the government is able to exert a strong influence on the
company's strategy through the appointment of its senior executives and constant surveillance.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
As of Dec. 31, 2018, Sinopec Corp.'s capital structure consisted of about RMB154.6 billion in senior unsecured debt
issued by Sinopec Corp., of which RMB51.4 billion was issued at the subsidiary level.

Analytical conclusions
We rate the senior unsecured debt issued by Sinopec Corp. at 'A+', which is the same as our long-term issuer credit
rating on the company. This reflects our view that the company's capital structure does not constitute material
subordination risk because priority debt does not exceed our threshold of 50% of consolidated total debt.
With its extremely high likelihood of extraordinary government support, we believe the government is willing and able
to intervene so that structurally subordinated lenders would not have poorer recovery prospects than structurally
senior lenders in case of financial distress.
