Credit Highlights
Overview
Key strengths

Key risks

Relatively large installed base of systems and high customer retention rates provide
revenue visibility and opportunities for higher-margin and more stable after-sale
services.

Limited product diversity and small scale compared with
that of other rated capital goods companies.

Low capital intensity that contributes to positive annual free operating cash flow
generation.

Operates in the fragmented and competitive global
automation market.

Low net debt leverage that provides ample financial flexibility for future
acquisitions or share repurchases.

Exposure to cyclical fluctuations in demand for automation
systems in certain end markets.

Steady organic growth and modest improvement in adjusted EBITDA margins over
the next couple of years.

Sizable acquisition could result in increased integration risk
and considerably weaker than expected credit measures.

Strong operating performance is behind better than previously expected results. ATS Automation Tooling Systems Inc.
delivered strong operating results in fiscal 2019 with organic revenue growth of 11.0% and adjusted EBITDA margins
of 14.3%. This represents the second consecutive year of double-digit organic revenue growth and margin
improvement. Increased business from new and existing customers along with ATS gaining efficiencies from better
supply chain management and other initiatives contributed to this improvement, in S&P Global Ratings' opinion. These
results compared favorably to our expectations last year for organic revenue growth of 3.0%-4.0% and an adjusted
EBITDA margin of 12.5%-13.0%. ATS also had a solid start to fiscal 2020, reaching an order backlog of C$982 million
at June 30, 2019 (up 8.6% from March 31, 2019). This reflects strong organic growth in bookings, particularly in the life
sciences and transportation end markets, which represent about 84% of the company's backlog and supports our view
that annual organic revenue growth should be in the low-to-mid single-digit area over the next couple of years.
Ratings upside remains constrained by the likelihood of increased leverage should the company expand or repurchase
shares. Adjusted debt-to-EBITDA should increase over the next couple of years because ATS is likely to fund material
acquisitions or repurchase shares with cash on hand, free cash flow generation, and possibly additional debt. As a
result, we assume the company's adjusted debt-to-EBITDA will ultimately return to 2.0x-2.5x and adjusted funds from
operations (FFO)-to-debt to 30%-45% within the next couple of years. Our forecast for higher leverage is consistent
with our view of ATS' financial policies and growth strategy.

SEPTEMBER 10, 2019 2

ATS Automation Tooling Systems Inc.

Acquisitions completed in fiscal 2019 were consistent with our expectations and there will likely be more. During fiscal
2019, ATS completed two acquisitions, with a combined purchase price of close to C$200 million, that we believe
should augment the breadth of the company' service offerings and capabilities while increasing scale. KMW
Konstruktion, Maschinen & Werkzeugbau GmbH and Co. KG and KMW GmbH, acquired Oct. 31, 2018 (third-quarter
2019), for about C$25 million, is a German-based supplier of custom micro-assembly systems and test equipment
solutions. Comecer S.p.A., acquired Feb. 28, 2019 (fourth-quarter 2019), for about C$170 million, is an Italy-based
automation solutions provider focused on aseptic containment and processing systems for the nuclear medicine and
pharmaceutical industries. These acquisitions were consistent with our previous forecast and we assume ATS will
continue to deploy C$100 million–C$200 million for acquisitions annually to strengthen its competitive position, but
we recognize this is highly speculative. We also note that ATS has capacity, all else being equal, to make an acquisition
larger than C$200 million while remaining within our existing rating category, given the company's very low adjusted
debt balance.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects S&P Global Ratings' expectation for ATS to generate positive organic growth over the
next couple of years while modestly expanding adjusted EBITDA margins. The outlook also incorporates our
expectation that acquisitions or share repurchases should contribute to adjusted FFO-to-debt increasing to
30%-45% within the next couple of years.

Downside scenario
We could lower the ratings within the next 12 months if operating performance were to deteriorate significantly,
contributing to weaker EBITDA margins and cash flow generation. We could also lower the ratings if the company
pursues a more aggressive financial policy, possibly through debt-funded acquisitions, resulting in sustained
adjusted FFO-to-debt approaching 20%.

Upside scenario
We could raise our ratings on ATS within the next 12 months if the company's competitive position improves.
Specifically, if ATS were to increase its scale, most likely through an acquisition that we believe would contribute
to stronger profitability characteristics. An upgrade could also occur if we expect ATS to sustain adjusted
FFO-to-debt above 45%, which could result from a reduced likelihood for material acquisitions, share repurchases,
or distributions.

Business Risk: Fair
Our view of ATS' business reflects the company's large installed base of automation systems globally, with recurring
revenue from a long-standing customer base and services business. It also reflects ATS' limited product diversity, with
close to 75% of revenue derived from the company's life sciences and transportation divisions. Moreover, ATS is a
small-scale manufacturer relative to the broader capital goods industry. We believe the global automation market
within which ATS competes is highly fragmented and competitive, which limits material upside to its product pricing.
Furthermore, the demand for a meaningful share of the company's products is sensitive to prevailing levels of
industrial activity, which is cyclical and can increase the volatility of cash flow and profitability through the credit
cycle.
ATS has a leading position in most of its addressable markets for automation systems. Close to half the company's
revenue is generated from customers in the relatively stable life sciences market. We also view life sciences to be one
of the key drivers of ATS' organic growth over the next few years. Contributing factors include the favorable
demographic trends driving demand for medical devices and pharmaceutical products, as well as the opportunity for
further automation investments. The company's second-largest market exposure is transportation, which is highly
cyclical and competitive. However, we believe ATS is well-positioned to benefit from the ongoing trend toward vehicle
electrification, which we expect will represent the majority of the transportation segment's growth.
ATS has demonstrated strong organic growth in recent years from the addition of new customers and the expansion of
long-term customer relationships with more than 90% of its bookings from repeat customers. We believe this reflects
the costs associated with switching systems providers and the quality of the company's products and services. In our
view, these long standing relationships provide some revenue visibility and opportunities for an increased share of

SEPTEMBER 10, 2019 5

ATS Automation Tooling Systems Inc.

higher-margin and more stable engineering and after-sale services (currently about one-third of revenue).
The company's profitability has been on an improving trend with adjusted EBITDA margin up 190 basis points to
14.3% in fiscal 2019. We believe adjusted EBITDA margins should improve modestly over the next few years due in
part to an increased mix of higher-margin service revenue, and efficiency gains. Increased scale from prospective
acquisitions and solid organic growth, supported in part by favorable macro-economic conditions, should also
contribute to stronger profitability over time. We estimate adjusted EBITDA margin to be 14.5%-15.0% over the next
couple of years, which we consider average for companies that manufacture and service industrial equipment and
systems.

Financial Risk: Intermediate
ATS currently has a low adjusted debt level at about C$265 million as of June 30, 2019, after S&P Global Ratings' debt
adjustments (see reconciliation table). We expect the company to continue to generate steady growth in earnings and
cash flow, led by organic annual revenue growth (2%-5%) and modest margin expansion due in part to an increased
mix of higher-margin service revenue, operating leverage, and efficiency gains. We also expect relatively stable capital
expenditures beyond fiscal 2020, which should facilitate positive annual free operating cash flow generation, estimated
at C$60 million-C$90 million.
Despite our expectation for higher earnings and cash flow generation, we believe adjusted debt-to-EBITDA should
increase over the next couple of years. This reflects our view that ATS is likely to fund material acquisitions or share
repurchases with cash on hand, free cash flow generation, and possibly additional debt. As a result, we assume the
company's adjusted debt-to-EBITDA will ultimately return to 2.0x-2.5x and adjusted FFO-to-debt to 30%-45% within
the next couple of years. Our forecast for higher debt leverage is consistent with our view of ATS' financial policies and
growth strategy as the company has stated it expects to employ moderate debt leverage to expand operations and is
comfortable operating with debt leverage (as per the company's definition) of 2.0x-2.5x.

Liquidity: Strong
Our liquidity assessment reflects our expectation that ATS should generate annual reported FFO of more than C$100
million. When combined with about C$608 million available under its revolving credit facility and about C$155 million
of cash as of June 30, 2019, we believe the company can easily cover its uses of cash in the next 24 months by over 6x.
We also believe that sources minus uses of cash would remain positive in a stress scenario, whereby our forecast
EBITDA declines by 50%. Despite these exceptional characteristics of liquidity, we believe a stronger assessment is
not warranted at this time, because of ATS' limited scale and our view that liquidity could decline meaningfully from
possible acquisitions or share repurchases.

Covenant Analysis
Compliance expectations
We expect ATS to continue complying with its covenants over the next couple of years, even in a stress scenario

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 10, 2019 9

ATS Automation Tooling Systems Inc.

whereby EBITDA is 50% lower or debt is 30% higher than our forecast.

Requirements
ATS has two covenants related to its secured credit revolver, a maximum net funded debt-to-EBITDA, and minimum
interest coverage.

Other Credit Considerations
We apply a negative comparable ratings analysis (CRA) modifier to reflect our view that ATS' business risk profile is at
the weaker end of our assessment. This view takes into account risks related to demand volatility and potential order
cancellations that could materially affect the company's business given the relatively modest scale and high operating
leverage.

Issue Ratings - Recovery Analysis
Key analytical factors
• The '6' recovery rating on the company's secured debt indicates our expectation for negligible (0%-10%; rounded
estimate: 0%) recovery in the event of default.
• Our simulated default scenario contemplates a default in 2024, stemming from increased competitive pressures and
a major economic downturn that forces customers to delay or cancel capital expenditures on automation systems.
• We assume these factors could pressure ATS' ability to meet its financial obligations, prompting the need for a
bankruptcy filing or restructuring.
• Our recovery analysis assumes a reorganization value for the company of about C$425 million, reflecting
emergence EBITDA of about C$85 million and a 5x multiple.
• We assume that, in a hypothetical bankruptcy scenario, the C$750 million revolving credit facility is 85% drawn.

Simulated default assumptions
• EBITDA at emergence: C$85 million
• EBITDA multiple: 5x

Simplified waterfall
• Net enterprise value (after administrative costs): C$403 million
• Valuation split % (obligors/nonobligors): 85/15
• Collateral value available to secured creditors: C$382 million
• Secured first-lien debt: C$679 million
• Total value available to unsecured claims: C$21 million
• Senior unsecured debt and pari passu claims: C$630 million
• --Recovery expectations: 0%-10%
