Overview
Key strengths

Key risks

Demonstrated ability to consistently generate 5% revenue growth or
more and to gain market share in competitive markets such as German
Do-It-Yourself (DIY) retailing sector where it boasts a No. 3 position.

Stiff competition in the less consolidated home-market Germany
compared to markets such as U.K. or France resulting in limited room
to transfer increasing costs to customer and persistent gross margin
pressure.

Track record of strong year-on-year sales growth on a comparable store
basis supported by well-established omni-channel capabilities, very
competitive pricing strategy, and strong customer satisfaction rates.

Meaningful earnings volatility in DIY sector given seasonality of
products offerings and discretionary nature of product spending that
could be scaled back from consumers in times of economic stress.

Meaningful geographic diversity with 65% of EBITDA generated outside
Germany and presence in less saturated and competitive DIY markets
such as Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Romania.

Increasing total adjusted debt burden following elevated investments
in the business, weak results in 2018, and highly capitalized lease
commitments despite real estate ownership.

Substantial real estate ownership--roughly 60% of total stores are freehold Limited ability to generate excess cash flows to repay debt given
assets providing for additional reserves.
meaningful capex spending and sticky dividends.

Well-established omni-channel capabilities and superior pricing strategy drive market share gains in competitive DIY
sector. Hornbach Baumarkt AG's consistent competitive pricing strategy with all-time low prices rather than
discounting and well-developed online capabilities, including available online offers in all relevant markets that support
majority of merchandise for home delivery and in-store pick-up, is a catalyst for increasing its share in the competitive
DIY market.
Year-to-date trading in fiscal 2019 supports our view of improving earnings generation following a weak fiscal 2018.
Strong year-on-year sales growth on a comparable store basis of 8.3% in first half of fiscal 2019 (ending Feb. 28, 2020)
helped by an early start in this year's spring season and our estimation of about 50 basis points (bps) improvement in
EBITDA margin (on a pre-IFRS basis) supports our view of improving earnings generation in fiscal 2019 compared
with the rather weak fiscal 2018. Hence, we see margin erosion in 2018 as partly driven by especially stiff competition
amid increasing intake prices and temporary elevated fix costs given roll-out of online channel in remaining markets
and overemphasis of projects supporting topline development.
Limited margin upside and no material excess cash generation results only in moderate deleveraging. While we expect
a stabilization in operating margins in fiscal 2019, we believe that strong competition from existing DIY players,
internet pure player, and discount formats increasingly selling DIY products limit any larger upside on operating

margins. In view of the company's very limited excess cash generated after capex and dividends, we expect only
moderate deleveraging mainly driven by sales growth.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our expectation that, despite a highly challenging trading environment, the group's
established market position will enable it to withstand the strong market competition, implement its plan to stem
its profitability decline, and achieve robust year-on-year sales growth on a comparable store basis. We anticipate
that debt will not increase further, given strong expected earnings generation and less capex investments, resulting
in--pro forma IFRS 16 accounting--S&P Global Ratings-adjusted funds from operations (FFO) to debt of 20%-22%,
adjusted debt to EBITDA of 3.6x-3.8x and adjusted discretionary cash flow (DCF) to debt of 4%-5% over the next
12 months. The stable outlook factors in timely refinancing of the 2020 maturing bullet bond.

Downside scenario
We could downgrade Hornbach over the next 12 months if reported free operating cash flow after all lease related
payments remains materially negative, for example as a result of higher-than-expected investments in working
capital or real estate, or earnings do not improve due to intensifying pressure in the competitive home market,
resulting in S&P Global Ratings-adjusted EBITDA margin falling below 7%. We would also downgrade Hornbach if
our adjusted FFO-to-debt ratio approached 15% and adjusted debt to EBITDA approached 4.5x.

Upside scenario
Owing to margin pressure, the high level of adjusted debt, and our forecast of low free cash flow generation, we
consider an upgrade as unlikely over the next year. The group continues to invest, which will likely curtail any
meaningful improvement in its credit metrics.
We could consider raising the rating if profitability improves sustainably while sales continue to increase
year-on-year on a comparable store basis. Coupled with lower spending on discretionary capex and substantial
positive free operating cash flow, this should translate into a FFO-to-debt ratio of at least 30% and DCF-to-debt
ratio approaching 10%.

Our Base-Case Scenario

Hornbach Baumarkt AG

Assumptions

• Economic scenarios for mainly Germany,
Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland, and Czech
Republic, which together have accounted for the
majority of Hornbach's EBITDA in the last fiscal
year.
• Real GDP growth in Germany of 0.6% in 2019,
followed by 1.1%-1.2% in 2020 and 2021, with the
eurozone only slightly higher at about 1.1% in 2019
and 1.3% in the two years thereafter, which
represents a slowdown in economic activity versus
2018 with 1.5% growth in Germany and 1.9% in the
eurozone.
• With unemployment remaining low in Germany and
the eurozone and consumer price inflation below
long-term average at 1.2%-1.7%, we expect real
private consumption of about 1.5% in Germany and
the eurozone to remain somewhat above GDP
growth, resulting in moderately beneficial
macro-environment for the DIY sector.

• Hornbach's revenues to increase by 6.5%-7.5% in
fiscal 2019 versus 5.3% in 2018, while revenue
growth will moderate to 4% to 5% in 2020 and 2021,
which is still above the market average and
supported by Hornbach's well-developed online
capabilities, and consistently more competitive
product prices compared with peers.
• Stabilizing adjusted EBITDA margin at
approximately 7.6% in fiscal 2019, helped by
operating efficiency measures and remaining at
7.4%-7.6% in fiscals 2020 and 2021 following a
100bps drop in margin to 7.4% in 2018 due to
continuously strong competition and further
required investments in omni-channel capabilities.
• Working capital related annual cash outflow of €30
million-€40 million for fiscals 2019 and 2020, in line
with sales growth and ramp-up of inventory of two
to three new stores per year.
• Moderating capex to €125 million-€145 million in
2019 compared with €195 million in 2018, which
was elevated due to real estate projects, but growing
again toward €140 million-€160 million in fiscal
2020.

• Dividends of about €30 million per year, in line with
previous years.
• No major acquisitions.

Base-case projections
We expect revenue growth and operating efficiency measures implemented to improve earnings from last year.
Improving operating performance in fiscal 2019, from 2018, given omni-channel capabilities, competitive pricing
strategy, and two to three net store openings per year should facilitate sales growth above sector average. This is
further supported by the earlier start in this year's spring season compared to last year. Operating efficiency measures
implemented by the group should also stabilize margins, mitigating the erosion observed last year. At the same time,
we expect no larger margin upside after fiscal 2019, given the fierce competition in DIY with new formats such as
internet pure player and discounter selling more DIY products.
Lower planned capex and improving operating performance support free operating cash generation compared with
fiscal 2018. We expect capex to moderate in fiscal 2019 from levels seen in 2018, which was elevated following two
store buybacks in Berlin for €40 million-€50 million and the purchase of development land in Switzerland for about
€30 million. In addition, stronger operating performance will also help to generate positive reported free operating
cash flow (FOCF) in fiscals 2019 and 2020 following material negative FOCF in fiscal 2018.
Ramp-up of inventory, still material capex planned and comparably sticky dividends constrain excess cash generation
for debt repayment in fiscals 2019 and 2020. While we expect free operating cash generation to improve, investments
into inventory to support strong topline development and still material capex for ongoing investments needs for IT,
logistics, about three store openings per year, and selected real estate projects will limit stronger upside for reported
FOCF. In combination with relatively sticky dividends planned over the forecast horizon, we believe that the group will
not generate material excess cash for debt redemption.

Company Description
DIY and home improvement operator Hornbach Baumarkt AG is present across Germany and eight other European
countries: Austria, Netherlands, Czech Republic, Switzerland, Sweden, Slovakia, Romania, and Luxembourg. It
provides customers a range of around 50,000 high-quality DIY and gardening articles at everyday low prices through a
network of 157 large format retail outlets, including 96 in Germany and 61 in other European countries as of August
2019.
Hornbach Baumarkt is part of the larger Hornbach Holding AG & Co. KGaA and is a material subsidiary of the larger
group. Apart from Hornbach Baumarkt, Hornbach Holding group has two other entities. Hornbach Baustoff Union
GmbH (HBU) operates a builders' merchant business and mainly has commercial customers. Hornbach Immobilien
AG is the real estate holding company of the group. The group's strategic decision of owning about half of the sales
areas on which the company has retail operations has resulted in Hornbach Immobilien holding about 30% of the
group's retail space while Hornbach Baumarkt holds about 30% of retail space itself.

Business Risk: Fair
We estimate that Hornbach Holding derives more than 90% of its sales and 75%-80% of S&P adjusted EBITDA in
2019 through its key operating subsidiary Hornbach Baumarkt AG. We view Hornbach Baumarkt as a core subsidiary
of the Hornbach Holding group and a key driver of the group credit profile. As such, Hornbach Holding's business risk
largely reflects our view of Hornbach Baumarkt's business risk profile.
We see the group's business profile supported by a well-established presence in the DIY market and sustained position
among the largest five players in Europe. This assessment incorporates the group's record of increasing market share
over a 15-year period. Hornbach is the fifth-largest DIY player in Europe. The group's strategic focus on larger stores,
which have floor space of greater than 10,000 square meters, provides the group with one of the broadest product
offerings in German DIY retailing with comparably high level of customer service such as professional advice for main
product categories. Customer satisfaction is high in its home market of Germany compared with peers.
At the same time, the large scale formats enables the group to competitively price its products. The price policy is
attractive for customers and a benchmark for competitors in the industry. In addition, the group has meaningful

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 26, 2019 10

Hornbach Baumarkt AG

geographic diversification--about 45% of its sales and 60% of reported EBITDA comes from outside Germany. We also
see Hornbach's well-established omni-channel offer with home delivery and in-store pick-up of ordered items as
leading among existing DIY players in its relevant markets. While online platforms have already rolled out in all
markets, we expect investments to continue in the omni-channel segment as volumes increase.
These factors are tempered by the high seasonality and cyclicality of the DIY sector, which exhibits a strong
dependence on weather and sensitivity to consumer sentiment, particularly for stores offering gardening products. We
view the German DIY sector as a saturated and highly competitive market, which has an increasing market share of
internet pure player and discounting formats that increasingly sell selected products such as power tools. In addition,
the German market has a number of equally large existing DIY retailers, thus limiting Hornbach's scale advantage for
supplier negotiations when compared to larger rated peers such as Kingfisher, which hosts a clear market leader
position in the U.K., for instance.
Going forward, we expect moderate net store expansion outside Germany, such as the Netherlands or Eastern Europe,
which helps Hornbach to expand into less saturated and competitive DIY markets compared to Germany. In this
respect, we also appreciate management initiatives to further expand the higher-margin private label offer toward 30%
over the mid-term, from about 24% in fiscal 2018, which we regards as typical for the industry. Both will help to offset
gross margin pressure from stiff competition.

*Issuer credit rating and outlook of Hornbach Baumarkt AG.

Financial Risk: Aggressive
Although results were weaker than we had expected in fiscal 2018, we note improving earnings due to strong topline
growth and implemented efficiency measures in the first half of 2019. We expect Hornbach Holding, relevant reporting
entity for our rating, to achieve a S&P-adjusted FFO-to-debt ratio of 22%-24% following only 19.5% last year (before
IFRS16 implementation), which establishes headroom under the current rating.
Pursuant to the new accounting standard IFRS 16 on leases, which Hornbach implemented starting first quarter 2019,
Hornbach Holding expects to capitalize an additional lease liability of €690 million to the already capitalized finance
leases as of fiscal 2019. This represents €200 million more than our operating lease debt that we capitalized previously
under our standard adjustment for operating leases. That said, there was no material impact on our credit metrics or
expectations given rent adjustments that are also added back to EBITDA. Pro forma IFRS 16, we expect Hornbach's
FFO-to-debt ratio of 20%-22% in fiscal 2019. This is roughly in line with our prior expectations for leverage and has no
effect on Hornbach's underlying creditworthiness or the ratings.
We also expect lower expansionary capex spending on real estate and ramp-up of omni-channel capabilities to support
free operating cash generation this year compared with last year. This will result in sufficient free operating cash
generation to cover dividends over the next two years. However, planned store openings, selective real estate projects,
and ongoing IT investments will still require material capex, topline growth also requires investments in inventory.
Thus, we believe the adjusted DCF-to-debt ratio of just below 5% over the next two years is still comparably low for
the rating.

Liquidity: Adequate
Hornbach Holding's adequate liquidity benefits, in our view, from the undrawn revolving credit facility and ample cash
accumulated in recent quarters in preparation for the repayment of the €250 million bullet bond due in early 2020,
which constrains our liquidity assessment. Sources of liquidity cover uses by about 1.4x over the next 12 months. We
estimate that headroom under the financial covenants should be comfortably above 50% over the same period. In our
base case, we anticipate that the group will successfully refinance its bullet bond, which will likely raise the coverage.
At the same time, the seasonal and discretionary nature of home improvement spending related to overall economic
activity amid ongoing margin pressure constrain our assessment. This limits Hornbach's ability to withstand
unexpected high-impact, low probability events without refinancing. We see the group's standing in credit market as
generally satisfactory and only constrained by our view about its ability to raise material funds at short notice because

Principal Liquidity Uses

We calculate total sources of liquidity of €900
million-€950 million, consisting of:

We estimate uses of liquidity at €650 million-€700
million over the same period, consisting of:

• Available cash and equivalents of about €350 million
as of May 31, 2019.

• Maturities of financial debt of €300 million-€350
million.

• Undrawn bank lines and liquidity facilities of about
€350 million.

• Working capital needs of €30 million-€40 million.

• FFO of €190 million-€210 million.

• Seasonal working capital requirement of €140
million.
• Capex of €130 million-€145 million.
• Dividend payments of about €30 million

Debt maturities
Maturing financial debt (excl. finance leases) as of Feb. 28, 2019:
• 2019: €332 million
• 2020: €16 million
• 2021: €80 million
• 2022: €21 million
• 2023: €188 million
• Thereafter: €137 million

Covenant Analysis
Compliance expectations
We estimate that headroom under the financial covenants should be very comfortably about 50% under the equity
covenant and about 70% under the EBITDA interest coverage over the next two years.

Requirements
The sub-group of Hornbach Baumarkt AG is required to comply with quarterly tested financial covenants in its €350
million revolving credit facility. These include a minimum equity ratio of 25% and an EBITDA interest coverage ratio
of at least 2.25x.

Group Influence
Our ratings on Hornbach continue to reflect our view of the credit profile of its parent Hornbach Holding on a
combined basis. This is because we consider Hornbach Baumarkt as an integral part of the group, which generates the
vast majority of Hornbach Holding's earnings and is the main source of the parent company's cash flow and liquidity.
Hornbach Baumarkt also benefits from shared functions and executive management team, which includes similar
individuals. Therefore, our rating on Hornbach is based on Hornbach Holding's consolidated group accounts, which,
among other factors, allow us to capture the benefit of relatively moderate share of rented stores in the overall group.

Issue Ratings - Recovery Analysis
Key analytical factors
• We rate the €250 million unsecured notes at 'BB'. The recovery rating is unchanged at '3', reflecting our expectation
of meaningful (50%-70%, rounded estimate: 65%) recovery prospects in the event of payment default.
• Although the numerical recovery outcome exceeds 65%, our criteria caps the recovery rating of the notes at '3' due
to their unsecured nature. This accounts for the risk that additional prior- or same-ranking debt could be raised on
the path to default.
• The recovery rating on the notes is support by the substantial value of real estate assets directly held at Hornbach
Baumarkt AG, resulting in our higher valuation at default compared with some retail sector peers whose real asset
base is mainly made up of inventories. In addition, the notes benefit from a guarantee of Hornbach International
GmbH, which is not guaranteeing any of the promissory notes.
• The recovery rating is constrained by prior-ranking liabilities of €154 million, made up mainly of about €95 million
in promissory notes issued at the Dutch operating subsidiary. Moreover, we consider material equally ranking debt
to the notes consisting of the €350 million revolving credit facility (RCF) that we expect to be 85% drawn at
hypothetical default, the €250 million unsecured bond itself and about €200 million promissory notes issued at
Hornbach Baumarkt AG.
• Our hypothetical default scenario assumes an economic slowdown and increased competition resulting in
deteriorating sales growth and profitability.
• We value the group as a going concern given its market position in the German DIY retail market with an increasing
presence in ecommerce and in other European countries.
• We note that only the documentation of the €350 million unsecured RCF includes a financial covenant. As a result,
there is a risk that the group might grant additional security or guarantees to the RCF lenders on the path to default
in exchange for a covenant waiver, which could lead to lower recovery prospects than anticipated for the unsecured
bondholders.

Simulated default assumptions
• Year of default: 2024
• EBITDA at emergence: €125 million
• Implied enterprise value multiple: 6.0x compared with a sector median of 5.0x given comparably high freehold share
in store real estate compared with other retailers, well-developed e-commerce capabilities allowing for above-sector

average growth and presence in international markets such as less saturated Eastern European DIY markets.
• Jurisdiction: Germany

Simplified waterfall
• Gross enterprise value at default: €750 million
• Net value available to creditors post 5% administrative costs: €710 million
• Priority claims: €154 million (1)
• Senior unsecured debt claims: €777 million (1) (2)
• Recovery expectation: 50%-70% (rounded estimate: 65%)
All debt amounts include six months' prepetition interest.
Includes €350 million RCF assumed to be drawn at 85%.
