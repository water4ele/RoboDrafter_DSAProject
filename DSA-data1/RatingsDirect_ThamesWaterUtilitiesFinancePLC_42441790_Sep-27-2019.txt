Key strengths

Key risks

Focus on low-risk regulated water and wastewater monopoly activities
in Greater London and the Thames Valley, two of the most affluent and
economically stable regions in the U.K.

Very limited financial headroom and flexibility owing to high debt
leverage.

Transparent, credit-supportive U.K. water regulatory framework ruled
by the regulator Ofwat results in relatively high predictability during
regulatory periods.

High regulatory reset risk from 2020, as the cost of capital is likely to be
lower, and earnings will increasingly depend on operating performance,
where Thames lags peers.

Various structural features designed to increase cash flow certainty for
debt holders.

Below-sector-average operating performance in recent years, and high
regulatory scrutiny.

Largest water company in the U.K.

The company faces a high regulatory reset risk following assessment by the U.K regulator. Thames Water Utilities
Finance PLC (Thames Water) is in the U.K. Water Services Regulation Authority's (Ofwat's) "significant scrutiny"
category, as part of Ofwat's initial assessment of the company's business plan for the 2019 price review (PR19). Ofwat
believes that Thames Water's plan falls considerably short in terms of cost efficiency, resilience, and delivery track
record. The regulator published a draft PR19 determination in July 2019, which is due to be finalized in December
2019. Thames Water has submitted its response to the draft determination, in which it disagrees with a number of
elements in the regulator's proposed plan, including the costs of capital, total expenditure (totex) allowance, and
several performance commitments. Thames Water also expressed its concern about the implications of the draft plan
for the company, its customers, and other stakeholders, and has proposed alternative inputs which it believes to be
well balanced.
We anticipate a challenge for Thames Water in meeting Ofwat's targets amid reduced allowed costs. In its draft
determination, Ofwat has set high targets on operating parameters, while lowering allowed costs. We think it would be
challenging for Thames to meet new targets with costs lower than previously proposed, particularly because it already
lags peers.
In the draft determination, Ofwat has:
• Set the likely range of returns from the outcome delivery incentive package equal to a return on regulatory equity
range of -3.27% to +0.53%. We view the skew toward the downside as material risk, given the below-average
operating performance in the current asset management period (AMP);
• Updated the cost of capital to 2.1% (based on a 3% retail price index [RPI]), a reduction of 0.21% from the early
guidance that was set out in the PR19 methodology;
• Cut average bills by 9.8% in real terms in the 2020-2025 period, compared with the company's proposed 2.4%
reduction;

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 12, 2019 3

Thames Water Utilities Finance PLC

• Reduced Thames Water's total expenditure costs by 15.7% (around £1.73 billion) compared with the previous
regulatory period; and
• Stretched targets for key performance commitments, such as a 25% reduction in the annual level of leakage by 2025
from the 2019-2020 level, and a 30% reduction in pollution incidents by 2024-2025.
Thames Water has incurred penalties following below-sector-average operating performance in recent years.The
company's performance in terms of customer service and belowground asset maintenance has led to extensive
regulatory penalties, partly due to extraordinary weather conditions. Thames Water also missed targets on leakage and
asset health indicators. Overall, in fiscal 2018-2019, the company has incurred a penalty of £51.6 million. As chart 1
shows, Thames Water has had penalties every year in recent years.
Chart 1

Financial results for 2018-2019 were hit by lower consumption volumes, steeper employee costs and penalties. Thames
Water reported lower margins than our expectations, generally reflecting higher employee costs. The results were also
affected by Thames Water's decision on an early return of £40.3 million of Outcome Delivery Incentive (ODI) penalties
to customers. Dividends and capital expenditure (capex) spend for 2018-2019 was in line with our expectations.
Overall, credit metrics remain subdued, with the ratio of funds from operations (FFO) to debt at 4% on a consolidated
basis (class A plus class B debt) and 4.7% for class A only, compared with our target of about 6% based on senior debt
only, and about 5% based on senior and subordinated debt.

Outlook

Our negative outlook on debt issued by Thames Water Utilities Finance PLC reflects our concern that the
company will struggle to maintain the FFO-to-debt levels we view as commensurate with the ratings (about 6%
based on senior debt only, and about 5% based on senior and subordinated debt), given the below-average
operational performance and recurring operational failures. The negative outlook also reflects a very high
regulatory reset risk and our expectations of further pressure as the company enters the next regulatory period in
April 2020, in light of a lack of financial headroom today.

Downside scenario
We could lower the ratings if FFO to debt remains below the level we see as commensurate with the current
ratings (about 5% for class B and about 6% for class A debt) and/or deterioration in EBITDA to interest cover ratio
to below 1.5x. A downgrade could also come from adverse impact from regulatory intervention and/or a
challenging outcome from the new regulatory review if we felt the company would not be able to maintain
sufficient headroom under its financial covenants.

Upside scenario
We would revise the outlook on the ratings to stable if Thames Water financial risk profile successfully recovers
more headroom and continues to improve its operational performance, and if we anticipate that Thames Water
can sustain a weighted average FFO-to-debt ratio of about 5% on average for its consolidated debt and about 6%
on its class A debt. The group could achieve this through supportive regulatory outcome, modification of its
financial policy, cost outperformance, and by improving profitability.

Assumptions

• RPI assumptions as per our in-house projections.
We forecast RPI inflation in the U.K. of 2.7% in
2020, 3.1% in 2021 and 3.6% in 2022.
• Low-single-digit growth in revenues for 2020 and in
AMP7 (starting April 2020). This is driven by a
combination of real price declines and our RPI
assumption.
• EBITDA margins of 50%-55% in our projected
period as compared with 48% in the year ending
March 31, 2019, reflecting ongoing efficiency
measures.

• Focus on the improvement of key performance
areas such as leakage, metering, and strengthening
of the network, with capex of about £800
million-£900 million per year in 2020, and £1,300
million per year in AMP7.
• Reduced dividend payments of about £50
million-£60 million for the rest of the regulatory
period.

Base-Case Projections
• Average FFO to debt of 5% on a consolidated level, and 5.5% for class A debt in our projected period.
• EBITDA-to-interest ratio of 1.9x-2.3x in our projected period.
• Reduction in overall leverage so that unadjusted debt to regulatory capital value (RCV) reduces below 80% at the
end of the next regulatory period.
• Negative free operating cash flow due to high capex until the end of AMP7.

Company Description
Thames Water is the U.K.'s largest water and sewerage company, with RCV of £14.3 billion on March 31, 2019.
Thames Water serves 15 million customers and about 25% of the population of England and Wales, generating
EBITDA of around £1 billion annually. We rate the debt issued by Thames Water. Thames Water has implemented a
process whereby it closed its offshore finance subsidiaries and replaced them with a U.K.-based entity.

Business Risk
The U.K. regulatory framework supports cash flow predictability and stability.
Our assessment of Thames Water's business risk as excellent reflects the stable and predictable revenue and cash flow
streams from the low-risk regulated water and waste water businesses, its natural monopoly position in its service
area--Greater London and the Thames Valley--and a generally supportive and transparent regulatory framework. We
consider that the U.K. water regulatory framework, which is designed and monitored by Ofwat, supports the industry,
given its transparency and stability (see
Why We See The Regulatory Frameworks For U.K. Utilities As Supportive
, published Sept. 26, 2017).

Thames Water lags peers in operating performance.
Although the company benefits from a stable and predictable regulatory framework, its operational performance was
below industry average over the past few years. The poor operating performance of its belowground water assets led

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 12, 2019 7

Thames Water Utilities Finance PLC

to the company failing its leakage target for 2019 and to a number of consumer interruptions, resulting in overall
penalties of £51.7 million in 2018-2019. Customer service measures also remain below the sector average, while recent
operating issues led to exceptional negative public comments by Ofwat. We note that recent performance was affected
by extraordinary weather conditions.

AMP7 brings a high regulatory reset risk and tougher operating conditions.
Like all U.K. water companies, Thames Water is exposed to regulatory reset risk every five years, as well as occasional
policy updates proposed by the regulator or the government. Reset risk is currently very high as the end of AMP6
nears and Ofwat's review process for the next regulatory period reaches its final stages. In its final methodology
publication, Ofwat revealed that although it proposes to offer companies greater scope to increase earnings through
incentives, it also intends to impose greater penalties on inefficient operators (see
New Ofwat Regulations Will Keep U.K. Water Utilities On Their Toes
, published Jan. 30, 2018). The proposed shift could represent an opportunity for higher rewards, but also brings the
risk of higher penalties. Looking at the current operating performance of Thames Water, higher penalties could impair
its financials.
Chart 3

Peer comparison
Thames Water is the biggest water and sewerage utility among all the peers based on RCV as of March 31, 2019. We
mainly compare Thames Water with other structurally enhanced debt companies that operate in England and Wales.
Thames Water's senior debt and subordinated debt tranches are rated one notch below those of these peers (namely at
'BBB+' and 'BBB-' against typically 'A-' and 'BBB'). These peers also have excellent business risk profiles, but tend to
have better operational performance than Thames Water, particularly in terms of customer services. Thames Water's
operating issues lead to lower profitability, as a result of which it maintains a financial risk profile weaker than its peers.
Debt to RCV of Thames Water on a consolidated level is one of the highest in the sector.

Financial Risk
The company has limited financial headroom and flexibility due to its high debt leverage. Over the past few years,
Thames Water's management has taken measures to improve its operations and meet regulatory standards over the
remainder of the current regulatory period (ending March 31, 2020), which will require additional investment and
operating expenses. The group is cutting its dividend payments to finance the additional operating expense and capital
expenditure. As a result, cash flow metrics will remain weak in 2020, and we expect that Thames Water's FFO-to-debt
ratios will remain at about 4%-5% based on consolidated class A (senior) and class B debt (subordinated), and 5%-6%
based on class A debt only.
We distinguish between the financing group's senior debt and subordinated debt, because we think that the
subordinated debt has a higher probability of default than the senior debt. This is due to its lower ranking in the
payment waterfall and the deferral of interest and principal in case of insufficient funds (please refer to the Structural
Features section below for more details).
We expect to see further pressure when the company enters the next regulatory period in April 2020. Ofwat's most
recent guidance indicates that from April 2020, water companies' allowed cost of capital will reduce from about 3.6%
in real terms to 2.1%, at an assumed RPI rate of 3%. This reflects Ofwat's recent lowering of its weighted average cost
of capital guidance compared with its initial guidance in December 2017 with indication for a further reduction at final
determination. In addition, Ofwat is introducing more rigorous benchmarks on cost efficiencies and service
performance. We note that in the response it published, Thames Water has proposed a weighted average cost of
capital of about 40 basis points higher compared with the guidance by the regulator under the draft determination.
Potentially offsetting the current tight headroom, we note Thames Water's commitment to reducing leverage over the
current and the next regulatory period. Thames Water's business plan includes reducing gearing toward 77% by 2025,
thanks to lower dividends and better operational performance. This should alleviate the pressure on Thames Water's
financial profile to some extent.

Significant increase in capex owing mostly to environmental factors:
Thames Water had planned totex of £10.99 billion, but Ofwat has reduced this to £9.26 billion in its draft
determination. In the response to the draft determination, Thames Water has adjusted totex program to about £10
billion, removing significant amounts of longer-term resilience spend.
In addition, Thames Water was allowed up to £179 million by Ofwat to evaluate potential strategic regional water
resource solutions, in partnership with others, including the River Severn to River Thames transfer scheme and the
strategic Abingdon Reservoir.

• Restrictions on mergers, acquisitions, and asset disposals, and share pledges in the operating and holding
company's assets (to the extent allowed by legislation) and shares;
• Dividend-restricted and debt-restricted payment conditions and dedicated liquidity facilities that should, in our
opinion, allow the financing group to manage temporary cash flow shocks; and
• The implementation of an automatic 18-month standstill period after breaching a debt restriction covenant
(commonly called event of default). During this period, secured creditors are (with certain limited exceptions)
prevented from taking any enforcement action or accelerate liabilities. However, they are allowed to enforce their
pledge (subject to a vote by majority of the class A creditors or class B if no class A debt is outstanding) of the 100%
of the shares in TWUL held through Thames Water Utilities Holding Ltd. (TWUHL) through a sale.
In particular, financial covenants include:
• A distribution lock-up, which would be triggered if the class A regulated asset-to-debt ratio were greater than 75%
and 85% (consolidated) or if drawings under the DSR or operating and maintenance facilities occur.
• An event of default, if the operating company's senior debt-to-RCV ratio reaches 95% or if the adjusted interest
coverage ratio based on consolidated debt is below 1.1x. Once an event of default has occurred, an automatic
standstill of claims takes effect, and no enforcement action can be taken by creditors for 18 months.
We expect that the financing group will remain compliant with its financial covenants. The class A debt-to-RCV ratio is
expected to decline toward 70% at the end of the next regulatory period, and consolidated debt to RCV towards 77%.
Interest cover ratios are also expected to remain well above covenant levels.

Other Credit Considerations
We consider that the class A stand-alone credit profile (SACP) benefits from stronger cash flow coverage ratios
(1.0%-1.5%) for senior debt only, compared with consolidated metrics due to the cushion of subordinated debt and the
better positioning of senior creditors in terms of security enforcement and decision-making power. This leads to an
uplift to Thames Water's senior SACP.

Structural Features
The financing group operates under a number of financial and nonfinancial covenants that support the group's overall
credit quality. We rate the debt issued by TWUF with our criteria Rating Structurally Enhanced Debt Issued By
Regulated Utilities And Transportation Infrastructure Businesses, published on Feb. 24, 2016. TWUF issues two types
of debt, senior (class A) and subordinated (class B). We analyze the group in two steps because we assess the
subordinated debt as having a greater risk of default than the senior debt. This is because the subordinated debt would
be paid after the senior debt, has no claim on the security until the senior debt is paid, and its default could not cause
the senior debt to default.
• Class A debt is rated 'BBB+' based on credit metrics excluding the subordinated debt, and including one notch of
uplift for various structural features, in particular the additional protection from the deferral of the subordinated debt
interest and principal if the financing group had insufficient cash to make the payments due.
• Class B debt is rated 'BBB-' based on credit metrics including senior and subordinated debt.
The various structural features of the transaction are designed to increase cash flow certainty for debtholders,
including restricted payment conditions and a covenanted liquidity structure that should, in our opinion, enable TWUF
to manage temporary cash flow shocks. In particular, debtholders benefit from:
• Ring-fencing of the group, which is achieved through TWUF's special-purpose status, significant independent
representation on the Thames Water Utilities PLC board (five of the 14 members), and some business, legal, and
regulatory restrictions;
• Three levels of financial covenants (a restricted payment condition, trigger events, and events of default) and an
automatic 18-month standstill period after an event of default. These provide creditors with significant control of
TWUF at an early stage of financial or operational difficulty or following material changes in business
circumstances. The covenants minimize the probability of default and create an additional credit cushion;
• Liquidity facilities of £550 million available to cover a standstill, provided by suitably rated counterparties. These
facilities are sufficient to cover finance charges, and dedicated to drawings if the company enters a standstill. The
facilities remain undrawn; and
• A strong covenant package, including limitations on additional debt, a defined cash waterfall of payments giving
senior debt priority, a minimum level of financial performance, and restrictions on distributions.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

Thames Water, along with other water companies in the U.K., has historically come under public pressure for
mishandling environmental, social, and governance-related risks by underinvesting in aging assets and paying
perceived excessive dividends, ultimately underperforming in its key social duty of providing quality water
services. In response to ongoing political pressure and negative press coverage, Thames Water has closed its
Cayman finance subsidiaries and replaced them with a U.K.-based entity. While we believe this is neutral to the
company's overall credit quality, we expect it to reduce the complexity of its capital structure and enhance
organization and reporting transparency. In addition, Thames Water has taken many proactive steps recently
including strengthening its board's independence and significantly cutting dividends, mitigating some governance
risks.
The U.K. water regulatory framework incorporates operational guidance for including environmental efforts. Our
negative outlook on Thames Water reflects to some extent that, despite its substantial proactive measures to
improve operating performance, the company has continued to miss several of its regulatory targets. These relate
to leakages, belowground water-asset health, supply interruptions, and security of supply. In this respect, we
believe Thames Water's operating performance lags those of other U.K.-regulated water companies.

Reconciliation
Thames Water reports under International Financial Reporting Standards. We make a number of adjustments to
Thames Water's reported figures. The main adjustments in the year ending March 31, 2019 are as follows:
• Deconsolidation: We deduct £47.5 million from revenues and £47.2 million from EBITDA and operating income
related to costs to Bazalgette Tunnel Ltd. to fund construction of the Thames Tideway Tunnel.
• Surplus cash: We deduct from debt £154.4 million cash that we consider unrestricted and surplus as defined by our
criteria.

• Operating leases: We add £72.2 million to debt, representing the present value of future minimum lease payments,
using a discount factor of 7%.
• Postretirement benefit obligations: We add to debt £251.5 million of postretirement benefit obligations.
