National CineMedia Inc. (NCM) has favorable contract terms with its founders.NCM has long-term exclusive contracts
with its founders--AMC, Regal, and Cinemark--the three largest movie exhibitors in the U.S. and pays its founders a
theater access fee instead of a revenue sharing agreement. Because of its cheaper theater access fees, NCM has a
considerably higher EBITDA margin than its key competitor Screenvision LLC.
NCM's operating agreement requires it to distribute substantially all free operating cash flow (FOCF) to its owners.
NCM LLC (the operating subsidiary) distributes nearly all of its FOCF to its founding members and to the public
holding company, as long as leverage remains below 6.5x. We expect NCM to generate healthy annual FOCF of
around $130 million, but its leverage is more than two turns below the 6.5x threshold and we anticipate that
distributions to its shareholders will result in minimal discretionary cash flow (DCF) and modest cash balances at the
operating subsidiary.
Changes in consumer behavior at the theater could reduce NCM's value to advertisers.Theater advertising isn't
exposed to the ad-skipping technology that hurts TV ad-viewing. However, changes in theaters' operating strategies,
such as reserved seating and placing bars in the theater lobby, may lead to customers taking their seats closer to the
published show time, which could reduce the number of viewers in their seats when preshow advertising is displayed.
While there has not yet been a significant decline in pre-show ratings, this shift could potentially affect NCM's
performance because national advertisers pay the company based on a cost per thousand (CPM) advertising pricing
metric.

SEPTEMBER 16, 2019 2

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our expectation that the company's pricing will continue to face pressure relative to
alternative media, despite our expectations for improved utilization and attendance growth over the next 12
months. We expect this to result in adjusted leverage remaining in the low-4x area.

Downside scenario
We could lower the rating if the company's leverage increases above 5x on a sustained basis. This scenario could
occur if operating performance deteriorates faster than expected due to pricing pressure or further declines in
utilization rates, which could occur if structural changes in theater operations reduces the attractiveness of
in-theater advertising.

Upside scenario
While unlikely at this time, we could raise the rating if we expect the company will be able to reduce and maintain
leverage below 4x. An upgrade would likely require improvements in utilization or pricing, leading to stable
revenue growth that more than offsets increases in theater access fees, as well as a change to its financial policy of
distributing almost all of its FOCF as distributions to shareholders.

National CineMedia Inc.

Assumptions

Key Metrics

• U.S. GDP growth of 2.3% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020;
• Revenue increases 2%-3% in 2019 due to increased
national advertising revenue related to a strong
second-half box office. We expect minimal revenue
growth in 2020 due to a weaker film slate and
continued weakness in local advertising.
• EBITDA increases at a lower rate than revenue in
2019 as increased expenses related to investments
in digital offerings offset some of the revenue
growth. We expect EBITDA to remain roughly flat in
2020.
• The company generates healthy FOCF, adjusted for
integration payments, of roughly $150 million in
2019 and 2020, but we expect that materially all of
its FOCF will be distributed to shareholders and
DCF will be minimal.

Note: All figures are S&P Global Ratings-adjusted.

The leverage ratio includes $27 million in aggregate
adjustments to as-reported debt (operating leases) and
a $33.9 million increase in EBITDA (theater integration
payments, operating lease rent and stock
compensation). We expect these amounts to remain
relatively unchanged in 2019 and 2020.

• Leverage modestly improves due to EBITDA growth
but remain in the low-4x area.

Base-case projections
NCM's revenue is more tied to movie theater attendance than GDP growth. While national advertising spending in the
U.S. correlates with GDP, the company's revenue growth is mostly determined by the attractiveness of the current and
upcoming film release slate, the timing of ad campaigns at its largest content partners, and trends in the national
advertising scatter market.

Company Description
NCM is the larger of the two competing digital in-theater media networks in North America. The company offers an
advertising and entertainment pre-show on theater screens and advertising programming on its lobby entertainment
network, as well as on its online network and mobile apps. NCM has long-term contracts with over 40 leading national
and regional theater companies. NCM Inc. is publicly traded but it only owns roughly 50% of the operating company,
with nearly all of the remainder held by Cineworld Group LLC and Cinemark Holdings Inc.

Business Risk: Fair
Over 70% of NCM's revenue is generated from national advertising, which tends to be highly cyclical.The company's
advertising revenue can be significantly affected by the timing of campaigns in its largest advertising categories and by
trends in the scatter market. NCM also has multiyear contractual revenue associated with its pre-show content
partners, public service announcement sponsors, and beverage concessionaires, which account for over 25% of total

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 16, 2019 4

National CineMedia Inc.

revenue and offset some of the cyclicality. While the company's revenue grew during the last recession, we believe
that advertising spending would decline in a future recession, which could lead to a significant deterioration in NCM's
revenue and credit metrics.
National Cinemedia is exposed to volatile box office attendance. Once NCM sells all or nearly all of its ad inventory,
declines in theater attendance could hurt performance because national advertisers buy inventory based on forecast
box office attendance. If performance is weaker than expected, NCM will have to use future scatter inventory to make
advertisers whole, foregoing additional revenue.
Revenue growth is tied to NCM's ability to maintain its pricing. We believe there is limited pricing upside, given
in-theater advertising's already high rates, which are roughly comparable to those of primetime broadcast television.
However, we expect the revenue mix to continue shifting toward the later portions of the preshow, which are more
expensive, increasing average CPMs. Unlike most other advertising media, NCM has limited ability to expand its ad
inventory and will therefore primarily rely on increasing inventory utilization and ad rate increases to generate revenue
growth.

Peer comparison
We view NCM's business favorably compared to Screenvision mainly due to its larger scale and its exhibitor services
agreement (ESA) that runs through 2037 with the three largest theater circuits in the U.S. Screenvision negotiates
contracts with individual theater circuits, with costs based on revenue-sharing agreements. Its contracts tend to be
much shorter than NCM's ESAs and the company faces much higher renewal risks. While NCM has the three largest
exhibitors, Screenvison has seven of the top 10 and 13 of the top 25.
NCM's founders account for roughly 80% of its screens and we believe that some midsize exhibitors that compete
directly with NCM's exhibitor founders likely do not want their larger competitors to profit from their attendance,
which provides Screenvision with a competitive advantage in securing their business. While the ESA is a competitive
advantage for NCM it does limit its flexibility compared to Screenvision. In some cases, Screenvision has negotiated
the rights to place advertising after the scheduled show time, which is less likely to be affected by reserved seating and
can be sold at a premium CPM. NCM would not be able to offer something similar in the vast majority of its theaters
due to its ESA.
While NCM has a much higher EBITDA margin than Screenvision because of its ESA, its operating agreement requires
it to distribute nearly all of its cash flow if leverage is below 6.5x. This limits NCMs ability to reduce leverage through
cash flow and offsets some of the advantage that the higher EBITDA margin provides.

Financial Risk: Aggressive
We expect NCM to generate healthy FOCF, but distributions to shareholders will result in minimal DCF and modest
cash balances. In addition, the company's dividend policy limits its ability to repay debt, requiring the company to
reduce leverage through EBITDA growth. While we expect modest EBITDA growth in 2019 and 2020, we expect
leverage to remain in the low-4x area.

Liquidity: Adequate
We expect liquidity sources will exceed uses by at least 2.0x over the next 12 months and net liquidity sources will be
positive, even if forecast EBITDA drops by 15%. However, we do not believe the company has generally prudent
financial risk management due to its dividend policy. The company's requirement to distribute almost all of its excess
cash flow to its shareholders results in a small cash balance at NCM LLC. We do not include the cash balance at NCM
Inc. in our liquidity analysis because the operating company would have no claim on that cash in a stress scenario.

Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Cash balances of $4.5 million as of June 27, 2019, at
NCM LLC;

• Capital spending of about $15 million annually; and

• Availability of $143 million under the $175 million
revolving credit facility; and
• Cash flow from operations of roughly $150
million-$160 million over the next 12 months.

• Virtually all FOCF is distributed as dividends
(roughly $130 million); and
• Mandatory amortization payments of $2.7 million
annually.

Debt maturities
• 2022: $400 million
• 2025: $268 million
• 2026: $230 million
If the $400 million of notes due in 2022 are not refinanced before Oct. 31, 2021, the entire balance of the senior
secured credit facility becomes due on Dec. 30, 2021.

Covenant Analysis
The senior secured credit facility has a 4.5x net senior secured leverage covenant that is in effect if the revolver has an
outstanding balance and a 6.25x total net leverage covenant. As of June 30, 2019, the company had roughly a 30%
cushion of compliance with both covenants. We expect the company to maintain covenant headroom of over 25%
over the next 12 months.

Issue Ratings - Recovery Analysis
Key analytical factors
• NCM's capital structure includes a $175 million senior secured revolving credit facility maturing in 2023, a $268
million senior secured term loan maturing in 2025, $400 million of senior secured notes due in 2022, and $235
million of senior unsecured notes due in 2026. NCM LLC is the borrower of the debt and owns substantially all of
the company's assets.
• National CineMedia Inc. (the public holding company) is not a guarantor to any of the debt and we do not expect
debtholders to have any claim on its cash or assets.
• The senior secured credit facility and senior secured notes rank pari passu and are secured by substantially all of
NCM LLC's material assets. The unsecured debt is subordinated to the secured debt.

Simulated default assumptions
• Our simulated default scenario contemplates a payment default in 2023, as a result of reduced cinema
advertisement spending and an attendance decline, either from a streak of unappealing films or audiences favoring

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 16, 2019 7

National CineMedia Inc.

entertainment alternatives.
• Other default assumptions include an 85% draw on the revolving credit facility, LIBOR is 2.5%, the spread on the
revolving credit facility and term loan rise to 5% as covenant amendments are obtained, and all debt includes six
months of prepetition interest.
• We expect NCM would reorganize in the event of a default, given its good market position, limited competition, and
key relationships with leading U.S. cinema exhibitors.

Simplified waterfall
• EBITDA at emergence: $90 million
• EBITDA multiple: 6x
• Net enterprise value (after 5% administrative costs): $540 million
• ----------------------------------------------• Estimated senior secured debt claims: $827 million
• --Recovery expectation: 50%-70% (rounded estimate: 60%)
• Estimated senior unsecured debt claims: $242 million
• --Recovery expectation: 0%-10% (rounded estimate: 0%)
