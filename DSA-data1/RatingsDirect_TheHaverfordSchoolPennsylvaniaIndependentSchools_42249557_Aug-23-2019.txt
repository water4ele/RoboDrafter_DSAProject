Haverford Sch (The) Issuer Credit Rating
Long Term Rating

Rationale
S&P Global Ratings raised its issuer credit rating to 'A' from 'A-' on The Haverford School, Penn. At the same time,
S&P Global Ratings assigned its 'A' long-term rating to the Montgomery County Industrial Development Authority,
Penn.'s series 2019 revenue bonds, issued for The Haverford School. The outlook is stable.
The raised rating reflects our opinion the school's robust operating performance and continued growth in financial
resources in recent years. Furthermore, we believe risk associated with the school's debt portfolio will be reduced
following the refunding of the series 2010 privately placed debt with the series 2019 fixed rate public issuance;
eliminating the potential risk of immediate acceleration and streamlining the school's debt structure, which we view
favorably.
The rating reflects our opinion of Haverford's robust financial operating performance on a generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP; full-accrual) basis, sound governance and management, improving financial resources,
and relatively stable enrollment that is currently experiencing some pressure in lower grades. The rating also reflects
our view of Haverford's moderate debt, with a modest pro forma debt service burden and higher, but still manageable,
pro forma smoothed MADS burden when taking into account the school's bullet payment.
The rating reflects our opinion of Haverford's:
• History of robust and consistent financial operating surpluses on a generally accepted accounting principles basis;
• Solid and growing endowment;
• Successful fundraising history; and
• No additional debt plans.
We believe the following credit factors weaken somewhat the preceding credit strengths:
• Softening headcount in the lower grades, reflecting the high competition for students, though other demand metrics
characteristics have remained relatively steady, with improving matriculation rates and good student quality;
• Use of reserves over the near term of approximately $8 million ($3 million to terminate existing swaps and $5
million toward its middle school project) though we anticipate available resources will remain consistent with the

The Haverford School, Pennsylvania; Independent Schools

rating category; and
• A trend of flat to slightly pressured net tuition revenue since fiscal 2016 and a concentrated revenue base, with
approximately 70% of adjusted revenue coming from tuition.
Proceeds from the $25.68 million (par) series 2019 revenue bonds will be used for the current refunding of the school's
series 2010 privately placed bonds, toward the payment of (or reimbursement to the School for) a portion of
construction costs for a new middle school building or other capital expenditures on the school's campus, and costs of
issuance. The bonds will be structured as interest only until 2049, when the full $25.68 million is due. Pro forma debt
service is approximately 3.2% of fiscal 2019 adjusted operating expenses, which we view as manageable. If we were to
smooth the debt service over the life of the bonds, the smoothed maximum annual debt service (MADS) burden would
be approximately $2 million, or 5.4% of adjusted operating expenses. Securing the bonds is a general obligation of the
school.
Total long-term debt outstanding as of fiscal year-end 2019, was $27 million, comprising the series 2010 bonds. We
believe the elimination of the event-driven liquidity risk with refunding the 2010 debt into public, fixed rate bonds
reduces the risk associated with the school's debt portfolio. The 2010 bonds are privately placed, and contain
covenants, that if triggered could cause immediate acceleration, though THS has solidly met these covenants in the
past. Additionally, two swaps fix approximately 67% of the 2010 debt. Pro forma, with this transaction, management
plans to terminate the swaps using internal reserves (approximately $3 million). At this time, management reports that
there are no additional debt plans.
The middle school project has a budget of approximately $18 million, with approximately $10 million to come from
fundraising, $3 million from proceeds of the series 2019 bonds, and the remaining $5 million from reserves. The new
middle school is expected to open in fall 2020.
The Haverford School is an independent, nonsectarian, college preparatory day school that educates boys in
prekindergarten through 12th grade (pre-K-12). The school, established in 1884 as the Haverford College Grammar
School, adopted its current name in 1903. As of fall 2018, the school has a student enrollment of 962 and enrollment is
expected to remain steady for fall 2019. According to management, it offers a challenging curriculum and is known for
its small class sizes. The institution is located six miles west of Philadelphia in the Main Line community of Haverford.
It competes with both independent and public schools in the surrounding area, including Episcopal Academy,
Germantown Friends School, and Shipley School.

Outlook
The stable outlook reflects our expectation that during the two-year outlook period, the school's enrollment and
demand profile will remain stable and solid operating margins will continue. While the school plans to draw on its
reserves for a capital project and to terminate its swaps, we anticipate that financial resources will remain consistent
with the rating. Management does not anticipate issuing additional debt during the two-year outlook horizon.
Successful navigation of its middle school project is also assumed.

Downside scenario
In our opinion, factors that could result in a negative rating action include significantly weaker operating margins,
material deterioration of financial resources, above what is expected, or if the school issues a significant amount of
additional debt without a commensurate growth in financial resources. Weaker demand and declining enrollment
could also have a negative effect on the rating.

Upside scenario
With this upgrade, we consider a positive rating action over the two-year outlook period unlikely.

Enterprise Profile
Demand and enrollment
Haverford's enrollment has historically been stable at about 1,000 students, but it is currently experiencing some
softening in its lower grades, a trend that is consistent with other independent schools. Total headcount in fall 2018
was 962, down from 978 in fall 2017. Management states that it will likely maintain headcount at or near current levels
during the next few years and anticipates meeting its budgeted goal of 960 for fall 2019. During the past few years, the
school has adjusted its recruiting strategy and is now focusing on targeted marketing. As a result, applications have
fluctuated--decreasing by approximately 10% in fall of 2016, increasing by about 11% in fall 2017, and subsequently
decreasing 11% in fall 2018. We understand applications are also up about 10% for fall 2019 compared to the previous
year. The school's demand profile remains adequate for the rating, characterized by moderate selectivity (which has
improved over time), adequate matriculation, and good student quality. Selectivity was approximately 58% in fall 2018;
slightly improved from 55% in fall 2017. Matriculation also improved in fall 2018 to 78%, from 70% in fall 2017, which
we view as adequate for the rating. In our view, student quality remains strong with an SAT score of 1331 for
graduating seniors in 2018. Preliminary enrollment indicators for fall 2019 include an increase in applications by about
10% and an acceptance rate around 52%, slightly weaker than the previous year.

Management
We are of the opinion that Haverford's governance and management are sound with good stability, which we consider
a credit strength. A 30-member board of trustees governs the school and there is a Haverford Leadership Council,
which acts like a farm system to attract and groom potential future board members. In addition, the senior
management team has good tenure and is talented. Haverford welcomed its ninth headmaster in July 2013, Dr. John
A. Nagl, who is a former United States Military Academy at West Point graduate, a decorated military officer, and a
recognized scholar and author. The school's chief financial officer has been in place for 18 years, which we believe
lends stability to the school's overall credit profile. In our opinion, the school's prudent fiscal management and
budgetary practices has led to consistently strong margins, which we view as a positive credit factor. We understand
the school hired new heads of school for both its upper and lower schools; effective summer 2018. The changes were
due to normal turnover, and we understand the transition for both roles has been smooth. We view management as
stable and do not anticipate any other changes over the outlook period.

Financial Profile
Operations
Haverford has consistently generated robust full-accrual based operating surpluses over the past several fiscal years--a
key credit strength. While net tuition revenue has increased historically, it has been flat since fiscal 2016. Based on
draft financials for fiscal 2019 (unaudited), THS generated another robust operating surplus of approximately $8.3
million, a margin of approximately 20.5%. However, if we were to strip out the approximately $2.8 million of net assets
released from restriction for capital in 2019, the operating margin would moderate to a still solid, $5,491 (13.6%
margin). Operations in fiscal 2018 were comparable to previous years with a sizable $5.4 million surplus, or a 13.5%
margin. Management reports financial operations remain positive due to cost-containment efforts and conservative
budgeting practices. The 2020 budget, based on enrollment of 960, is comparable to 2019. Management indicates that
the slight pressure on the tuition discount rate and that softening of enrollment in the lower grades could moderate
operating performance in subsequent years; however, given the history of conservative budgeting and tight expense
management, we anticipate that positive operating performance will continue.
While management is projecting the discount rate will remain pressured again in fiscal 2020, we believe Haverford's
prudent fiscal management policies will likely lead to the continued generation of full-accrual surpluses. The school
budgets for full depreciation expense, which we consider a best practice. In our view, revenue diversity remains
limited, with tuition and auxiliary income accounting for 74% of revenue in fiscal 2019 (unaudited) followed by gifts at
12% and endowment income at 7%. We consider endowment spending a manageable $3.2 million in fiscal 2019,
which represents a spending rate of 3.8% of the past three-year market value moving average. The school does not
expect to make any changes to its endowment spending policy within the next two years.

Financial resources
In our opinion, Haverford's financial resources have improved over the past several years. As of June 30, 2019, the
school had expendable resources of $63.6 million or 157.0% of adjusted operating expenses and 248% of pro forma
debt (corresponding median ratios for the rating category are 136.6% and 235.4%, respectively). Cash and
investments, including restricted assets, were a stronger $95 million, or 235% of fiscal 2019 adjusted operating
expenses and 352% of debt. We view resources as sufficient for the rating category. In summer 2019, the school broke
ground on the construction of a replacement middle school, which it expects will be completed in September 2020.
The project's budget is anticipated to be around $18 million, with $10 million expected to be fundraised, $5 million to
come from the school's reserves, and $3 million in proceeds from the series 2019 bonds. Since the school may use
some of its reserves to fund the project as well as $3 million to go toward terminating its swaps, it is possible that
resources will soften slightly over the outlook period. If we were to consider cash and investments lighter by about $8
million, cash and investments to adjusted operating expenses and pro forma debt would equal 215%, and 339%,
respectively, which we consider consistent with the rating.

Endowment
Total endowment market value was approximately $83.4 million at fiscal year-end 2019, which, in our view, is
comparable with its peer institutions. During fiscal 2017, the school used approximately $5.0 million of its endowment
funds to pay off its series 2007 bonds. Because of strong market returns, even with this one-time draw, the endowment

AUGUST 15, 2019 5

The Haverford School, Pennsylvania; Independent Schools

ended higher than its value as of the end of fiscal 2016 ($67.6 million). Management transitioned management of its
endowment funds to a different money manager in 2018. Under the new money manager, approximately $37 million
was not liquid for the first year of the investment, but as of Nov. 1, 2018, is now available for redemption on a quarterly
basis. Management notes that another $38 million of its endowment funds remain liquid on a daily basis. Endowment
funds are currently invested in 53% equity, 28% fixed income, 12% absolute return and 7% real assets.

Fundraising
Haverford is in currently in the public phase of a capital campaign, which includes goals for capital projects, operating
funds, and the endowment. The campaign includes funds for a middle school rebuild, which began in summer 2019.
The school plans to fundraise about $10 million toward the approximately $18 million project, with about $9.5 raised
to date. The project is expected to be completed in September 2020, which also corresponds with the anticipated
conclusion of the campaign.
Haverford successfully completed a comprehensive campaign in 2011, and it achieved its $60.0 million goal. Annual
fund giving has remained stable with annual fund raising totaling $3.3 million in fiscal 2019, up from $2.6 million in
2017 and $3.0 million in fiscal 2018. Management has conservatively budgeted to raise about $3 million toward its
annual fund in fiscal 2020, which includes The Haverford Fund and other gifts.
