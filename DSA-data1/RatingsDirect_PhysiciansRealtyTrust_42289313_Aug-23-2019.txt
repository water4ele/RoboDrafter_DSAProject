Key Risks

Above-average asset quality, coupled with positive industry
tailwinds, should continue to support solid occupancy, favorable
re-leasing spreads, and stable cash flows.

Recent tenant issues (LifeCare and the El Paso Surgical Hospital) have
caused some minor disruptions to cash flows, although we expect the
long-term impact to be negliglbe.

Well-diversified portfolio by geography and tenant with no market
representing more than 8% of gross leasable area (GLA) and no
tenant accounting for more than 6% of annualized base rents
(ABR).

The company's exposure to properties that are off-campus/unaffiliated with
major health care systems is modestly higher than pure-play MOB rated
REIT peers, posing greater risk of vacancy upon lease expiration.

Well-staggered lease expiration schedule with a weighted average
remaining lease term of approximately 7.5 years.

We believe capital recycling initiatives and a lower cost of capital have helped improve Physicians Realty Trust's
(DOC's) portfolio quality by enabling the company to accretively acquire higher quality assets. Ongoing capital
recycling initiatives and a longer-term strategy to become a pure-play, medical office building (MOB)-focused health
care REIT, have greatly improved DOC's portfolio quality over the past several years. As of June 30, 2019, DOC
generated 88% cash net operating income from buildings that were either on-campus or affiliated with major health
care systems, a material increase from the 78% reported as of March 31, 2016. Over that same reporting period, DOC's
investment grade tenancy surged to 52.8% of GLA compared with 29%, while its average building size increased to
more than 54,000 sq. ft. (versus an average of slightly below 39,000 sq. ft.). We also consider DOC's portfolio to be
well-diversified geographically and by tenant, with no MSA representing more than 8% of GLA and no tenant
accounting for than 6% of ABR.

DOC is currently dealing with two tenant disruptions, but the longer-term impact to cash flows should be negligible.
Despite some recent tenant disruptions, we believe the impact to DOC's portfolio is manageable given the limited
amount of at-risk ABR. One tenant, LifeCare Holdings LLC (1.5% of ABR), filed for bankruptcy protection in May.
However, the master lease on DOC's three LifeCare assets is expected to be assumed by the winning bidder at a recent
auction, with no modifications to the existing lease terms. The other, the former Foundation El Paso Surgical Hospital
(1.3% of ABR), is still unresolved. While the physicians group has been delinquent on their rent since April, this facility
will likely be sold in the relatively near term and shouldn't cause any meaningful disruption to cash flows. DOC has
two additional "watch list" tenants that represent another 1.2% of ABR combined, but DOC expects to be fully repaid
by both tenants by year end. Furthermore, we view favorably DOC's longer term strategy to divest its long-term acute
care hospitals (LTACHs) and specialty hospitals as we view these facility types as more challenging to repurpose (or
re-tenant, should the existing tenant vacate for whatever reason) than MOBs.

Outlook

The stable outlook reflects our view that DOC will continue to grow at a healthy pace, largely financed by a
combination of equity issuance, non-core dispositions, and internally generated free cash flow. We anticipate the
company will generate stable growth in line with its 2%-3% same-store contractual rent increases. Furthermore, we
project the company's leverage will remain relatively stable with adjusted debt to EBITDA in the low-6x area over
the next two years, with debt/undepreciated capital in the mid- to high-30% area.

Upside scenario
We could raise the rating by one notch if the company successfully recycles capital to further strengthen its asset
quality to a level closer to that of key peers, continues to increase its scale in a prudent manner (sourced with
either non-core dispositions or significant equity issuance), while simultaneously maintaining strong performance
from its core portfolio. To receive strong consideration for an upgrade, DOC would also need to reduce leverage
such that S&P Global Ratings' adjusted debt to EBITDA approaches the mid-5x range.

Downside scenario
While highly unlikely over the next two years, we could lower the rating if DOC pursues significant debt-financed
expansion such that debt to EBITDA rises above 7.5x on a sustained basis. We could also lower the rating if DOC
faces meaningful tenant stress that results in prolonged poor operating performance.

Base-case projections
We expect same-property revenue growth in the 2%-3% range in both 2019 and 2020. We believe DOC is
well-positioned to benefit from favorable industry tailwinds such as an aging population and the significant increase in
outpatient care relative to care delivered at a hospital setting. Coupled with this favorable backdrop, DOC's long
weighted average lease term of approximately 7.5 years and minimal near-term lease expirations (only 5% of leases
expiring through 2020), should result in steady cash flows and continued solid occupancy.
The pace of acquisitions is expected to accelerate slightly in 2019, to a range of $200 million to $400 million. DOC has
historically relied on a significant equity component in its capital raising efforts, and as of June 30, 2019, debt was 32%
of the company's total enterprise value (equity was 68%). We expect DOC to utilize its $300 million ATM Program as
well as select asset sales and free cash flow to prudently fund its acquisitions pipeline over the next two years.
We expect credit protection measures to remain relatively stable over the next two years. As of June 30, 2019, DOC's
adjusted debt to EBITDA was 6.2x and its debt to undepreciated capital was 35.1%. We expect these ratios to remain
relatively stable over the next two years with adjusted debt to EBITDA in the low 6x area and debt to undepreciated
capital in the mid- to high-30% range. We believe DOC is committed to maintaining a relatively conservative financial
policy, and that it will continue to grow its portfolio in a leverage-neutral manner.

Company Description
DOC is a self-managed health care real estate company organized to acquire, selectively develop, own and manage
health care properties that are leased to physicians, hospitals, and health care delivery systems. The company's

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

AUGUST 21, 2019 6

Physicians Realty Trust

investment strategy is largely focused on acquiring off-market or lightly marketed MOBs that are affiliated with major
health care systems. DOC was formed as a Maryland corporation in 2013 around four health care real estate funds
managed by B.C. Ziegler & Co.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
As of June 30, 2019, DOC's portfolio consisted of 252 health care properties totaling 13.6 million square feet of gross
leasable area (GLA) in 30 states. Since the time of its IPO in 2013, DOC has increased its gross real estate investments
to nearly $4.5 billion (from $124 million at the time of its IPO).
The company derived 97% of total NOI from MOBs, with 2% from specialty hospitals, and 1% from LTACHs as of
June 30, 2019. Same-property MOB performance was solid, with the company generating same-store cash NOI of
3.5% in the second quarter of 2019. DOC's same-store (MOB) properties were 95.5% leased at June 30, 2019, among
the highest in the industry, and the retention rate is a solid 76%. Moreover, the company's lease expiration schedule is
well-staggered, with a weighted average lease term of approximately 7.5 years and only 5.0% of leases expiring before
year-end 2020. Tenants are relatively well diversified compared with other health care REITs, with the largest tenant
accounting for 5.7% of ABR and the top 10 accounting for 29.6% (of ABR) as of June 30, 2019.
Chart 4

Although the gap has closed considerably over the past few years, we think the quality of the company's assets
remains slightly below its closest MOB pure-play peers. As of June 30, 2019, 12% of cash NOI is off-campus and
unaffiliated to major health care systems. We acknowledge that DOC's off-campus properties aren't located in tertiary
markets and are likely less vulnerable than the nationwide pool of off-campus MOB properties. However, we view

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

AUGUST 21, 2019 7

Physicians Realty Trust

these properties as somewhat inferior to on-campus/affiliated properties. We believe there is a greater risk attached to
maintaining the tenants when leases are up for renewal, and there is additional competition from other office buildings
(so that even if tenants renew, the lessor may be forced to accept lower rates of rent growth). The company is
gradually tackling this issue with new acquisitions partially funded by the disposal of weaker-positioned MOBs.
Moreover, while we think tenant disruptions have remained manageable, they have occurred more frequently than
they have at DOC's closest peers. On May 6, 2019, LifeCare Holdings LLC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
and has not paid DOC contractually-owed rents for April and May 2019. In June 2019, DOC resumed the collection of
rents and has received full payments for June, July, and August 2019, and is expected to transition its existing lease
agreement to a new tenant with no lease modifications. DOC's exposure to its three other "watch list" tenants
represents 2.5% of ABR, although the company expects to collect full rent by year-end 2019 from two of those tenants
(representing 1.2% of ABR). Given the relatively limited amount of at-risk ABR, in conjunction with DOC's swift
response in addressing struggling tenants, we believe these tenant disruptions are manageable and will cause
negligible long-term disruption to cash flows.

Financial Risk: Intermediate
We believe DOC's prudent funding strategy and relatively low leverage are key strengths to its financial profile. We
view DOC's capital structure as relatively conservative given its largely unsecured and fixed-rate debt structure, along
with a well-laddered debt maturity schedule.
DOC has had a robust appetite for growth in the past, but its pace of acquisitions noticeably abated over the past
couple of years--it acquired just $271 million of assets in 2018 after exceeding $1.2 billion in both 2016 and 2017. Two
factors caused this slowdown. First, DOC's stock price declined in late 2017 and in early 2018, limiting the company's
ability to raise equity capital without materially diluting the existing shareholders. Second, a highly competitive market
for MOBs has led to lower cap rates, with fewer potential acquisitions exceeding DOC's investment return hurdles.
Year-to-date through Aug. 7, 2019, DOC's real estate investments (including development commitments) have totaled
$139.0 million; we expect a greater number of acquisitions to close over the last several months of 2019. We expect
DOC to fund its growth in a leverage-neutral manner, and for leverage metrics to remain relatively unchanged from
current levels. As of June 30, 2019, DOC's adjusted debt to EBITDA was 6.2x, with fixed-charge coverage at 3.7x and

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

AUGUST 21, 2019 9

Physicians Realty Trust

debt to undepreciated capital at 35.1%.
Additional factors we consider positives include the company's weighted average interest rate of 3.8% as of June 30,
2019, and the fact that DOC has no significant debt maturities until the company's credit facility comes due in
September 2022.

Liquidity: Adequate
We assess DOC's liquidity as adequate. Our assessment of the company's liquidity profile incorporates the following
expectations and assumptions:
• Liquidity sources will exceed uses by at least 1.2x over the next 12 months;
• Liquidity sources will be positive, even if forecasted EBITDA declines by 10% (a REIT specific threshold for
adequate liquidity);
• Sufficient covenant headroom for forecasted EBITDA to decline by 10% without the company breaching covenant
tests, and debt is at least 10% below covenant levels;
• A generally satisfactory standing in credit markets; and
• Sound relationships with banks.

Principal Liquidity Sources

Covenant Analysis
Compliance expectations
As of June 30, 2019, DOC was comfortably in compliance with the financial covenants under its credit facility and
senior unsecured notes. We believe the company will maintain sufficient covenant headroom over the next 12 to 24
months.

Other Credit Considerations
Additional potential sources of capital include access to secured debt. Given that DOC's secured leverage ratio was
2.3% as of June 30, 2019, we believe the company has some flexibility to pursue additional secured debt for

refinancing purposes without jeopardizing the current unsecured debt rating.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
For real estate companies, we typically rate the senior unsecured debt the same as the issuer credit rating unless the
percentage of secured debt exceeds 35% of total undepreciated assets (or 40% of the fair market value of assets).

Analytical conclusions
The majority of DOC's properties are unencumbered, and the ratio of secured debt to undepreciated assets was 2.3%
as of June 30, 2019, which is well below the threshold of 35%. Therefore, we rate the company's unsecured debt
'BBB-', the same as the issuer credit rating.
