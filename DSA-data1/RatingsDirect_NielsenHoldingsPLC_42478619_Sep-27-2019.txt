Nielsen Holdings PLC benefits from strong market positions in its two principal segments. The company is the leading
global provider of media measurement, retail sales data, and market share data and its Global Connect and Media
segments both have strong market positions. Nielsen's television audience measurement service is the industry
standard in the U.S. and its position as the accepted third-party independent arbitrator of audience measurement is
unlikely to be displaced over our forecast horizon. The Global Connect segment also benefits from a global footprint.
Further, the company has high proportion of its sales under multiyear contracts and has strong renewal rates with
more than 70% recurring revenues.
Nielsen must adapt to an evolving business landscape. Television consumption is experiencing audience fragmentation
as viewership shifts toward digital platforms and time-shifted viewing. These shifts require enhanced audience
measurement capabilities that unify measurement of linear and digital viewership toward a common platform allowing
for greater standardization in ad buying across distribution mediums. In our opinion, the environment in which Nielsen
operates is evolving faster than the company's response to the changes. On the Media side, the company hasn't been
able to establish itself as the de facto standard for measuring audiences on digital platforms, though no other company
has either. In addition, changing consumer data and privacy regulations (including General Data Protection Regulation
[GDPR]) are becoming increasingly important. On the Global Connect side, the business is exposed to weak end
markets, with continued softness in fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry. If the company fails to adapt and
compete effectively in the evolving media landscape, we would expect Nielsen's earnings to suffer.

Nielsen's strategic review could affect financial policy and credit measures.The company will announce the
conclusions of the strategic review of its business, including the Global Connect segment, when it announces
third-quarter 2019 earnings results. The outcome could affect our 'BB' issuer credit rating, especially if it decides to sell
or significantly shrink the business, reducing its scale and potentially some of the positive benefits that result from the
Media and Global Connect segments sharing common ownership. Additionally, even if the company remains intact,
we will assess its financial policy after the strategic review and its plans for managing shareholder returns and reducing
leverage. Historically, Nielsen has aggressively pursued debt-funded acquisitions and returned cash via share
repurchases to shareholders. However, Nielsen has been less aggressive over the past 18 months and over the past
three quarters has not repurchased any shares. In our view, we expect Nielsen to continue to prioritize de-leveraging
over share repurchases until it returns to historical leverage in the low to mid-4x area.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our expectation that Nielsen's adjusted leverage will modestly decline to the mid- to
high-4x area over the next year. While we continue to view the company as a leader in audience measurement,
data, and analytics, it faces intense competitive and secular pressures in its core markets due to secular shifts that
are hurting its major clients. Due to these pressures we expect growth to be remain challenged over the next year.

Downside scenario
We could lower our issuer credit rating on Nielsen if its adjusted leverage increases above 5x on a sustained basis,
which could occur if the company experiences greater operating pressure in both its watch and buy segments,
resulting in revenue and EBITDA declining and minimal discretionary cash flow generation. Alternatively, if the
outcome of the strategic review alters our view of the business' strength, we could reassess our view on the rating.

Upside scenario
While unlikely in our view over the next 12 months, we could raise the rating if our view of the company's
business/operating metrics improves and it lowers its adjusted leverage to below 4x on a sustained basis. This
would entail the company returning to growth in the buy segment and greater than mid-single-digit percent growth
in the watch business, leading to double-digit EBITDA growth and significant discretionary cash flow generation.

Assumptions

• U.S. GDP growth of 2.5% in 2019 and 1.8% in 2020,
eurozone GDP growth of 1.1% in 2019, and 1.3% in
2020, and U.K. GDP growth of 1.2% in 2019 and
1.4% in 2020.
• Flat to slightly lower revenue in 2019 despite GDP
growth due to competitive and regulatory
challenges. Revenue is more in line with GDP in
2020 at 1%-2%.
• Global Connect segment revenue declines 1%-2%
on a constant currency basis in 2019 because of
weakness in developed markets, partially offset by
moderating growth in emerging markets. Almost flat
revenue in 2020 as growth in emerging markets
stabilizes.
• Global Media segment revenue growth of 2%-3% in
2019 and 2020 due to growth in national TV and
digital businesses, new contract wins, and new
product launches as the negative impact of GDRP
subsides.

EBITDA (operating leases and share-based
compensation expenses). We expect debt adjustments
to increase to $485.6 million in 2019 and $640.5 million
in 2020 due to higher lease liabilities, with EBITDA
adjustments of about $160 million in 2019 and $186

points (bps) to 100 bps in 2019 and 2020 driven by
productivity initiatives and lower restructuring costs.
• The company generates $100 million to $125 million
in S&P adjusted discretionary cash flow (adjusted
free cash flow less dividends and share repurchases)
in 2019, improving to about $190 million-$215

Company Description
Headquartered in New York City (but incorporated in the U.K.), Nielsen is a leading global information and
measurement company that provides media and marketing information, analytics, and manufacturer and retailer
expertise about what and where consumers buy, read, watch, and listen. The company has presence in more than 100
countries. Starting in 2019, the company reorganized its segments and now reports under the following two segments:
• Nielsen Global Connect (48% of revenue as of the 12 months ending June 30, 2019): Provides retail transactional
measurement data, consumer behavior information, and analytics primarily to businesses in the consumer packaged

SEPTEMBER 16, 2019 4

Nielsen Holdings PLC

goods industry.
• Nielsen Global Media (52%): Provides viewership and listening data and analytics primarily to the media and
advertising industries for television, radio, print, online, and mobile viewing and listening platforms.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
As the leading global provider of media measurement and retail sales and market share data, Nielsen benefits from
strong market position in its two principal businesses. However, we also believe there is a modest risk this strong
market position could come under pressure in the long term. Nielsen's superior position in TV audience measurement
could become less important as audience fragmentation accelerates and smaller competitors develop innovative
audience measurement services. This risk could be tempered by how total audience measurement--and Nielsen's
platform to connect all of its audience measurement capabilities across devices and platforms to more
comprehensively measure viewership--develops. If the advertising industry's digital measurement methodology
remains fragmented it will likely continue to erode Nielsen's competitive position as viewership shifts to digital
consumption. However, Nielsen can benefit disproportionately if its digital measurement system were to become the
standard for advertisers similar to its television-based measurement system.
While Nielsen's core audience measurement business continues to grow modestly, the industry faces pressure due to
increasing regulations around data privacy, including European data and privacy regulations (GDPR). These
regulations are creating challenges because data providers need to implement privacy protections and ensure that data
is safeguarded. Nielsen relies on third parties to provide certain data and services in both of its segments. Due to these
regulations, suppliers may refuse to license data or charge higher prices, pressuring the company's profitability. We
expect growing data privacy laws will impede Nielsen's marketing effectiveness business because of reduced access to
third-party data, making it more difficult to monetize analytics sold to advertisers to measure the effectiveness of
various marketing campaigns. In addition to these growth challenges, Nielsen is increasing its investment spending in
both segments to keep pace with the changing business environment. Nielsen needs to continue investing heavily in its
technology and video measurement capabilities to maintain and grow its market position as viewer consumption
habits continue to evolve.
Despite the current challenges, we continue to believe that Nielsen benefits from its strong market positions. Nielsen's
high proportion of sales under multiyear contracts and strong renewal rates (over 70% contracted at the beginning of
the year) should help provide some stability to the overall business. The company also has significant geographic
diversification, with more than 40% of revenues generated outside of the U.S.

Peer comparison
Nielsen's closest peer in the audience ratings business is ComScore (not rated). However, it is significantly smaller than
Nielsen, lacks a global presence, and has had significant management turnover. Information Resources Inc. (IRI) is a
peer for Nielsen's Global Connect segment. While IRI is smaller and lacks geographic diversification, it is growing
much faster in developed markets than Nielsen. We also compare Nielsen to other information and media companies
that are not direct competitors but provide data analytics.

Financial Risk: Aggressive
The company's adjusted leverage was 5.0x as of June 30, 2019, up from 4.8x at year-end 2018 due to its challenging
operating environment. We expect leverage to decline to about 4.7x-4.8x by the end of 2019 before improving to the
mid-4x area in 2020. Historically, the company has had limited discretionary cash flow as it returned all its free
operating cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. However, as leverage has increased
over the past year the company has stopped its share buybacks in order to use excess cash flow to reduce leverage.
We expect the company to continue this financial policy until it reduces leverage back toward historical levels in the
low- to mid-4x area.

Liquidity: Adequate
We believe that Nielsen has adequate liquidity sources to cover its needs over the next 12 months, supported by its
significant cash balance, access to the $850 million revolving credit facility ($311 million drawn as of June 30, 2019),
and relatively low debt amortization. We expect the sources to exceed uses by about 1.8x and net sources to remain
positive, even if EBITDA declines by 15%. The company has a maximum net debt leverage covenant of 5.5x and we
expect the company will maintain more than 20% covenant headroom.
The company has an upcoming maturity of about $800 million 4.5% senior debentures maturing in October 2020. We
expect the company to address this maturity after it completes its strategic review. However, the company has
sufficient liquidity to address this maturity without accessing the capital markets.

Covenant Analysis
Nielsen is subject to a financial covenant requiring its consolidated total net debt ratio to not exceed 5.5x. We expect
Nielsen to maintain about 20% or more covenant headroom over the intermediate period.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

We believe that Nielsen faces social risks stemming from its focus on collecting and using personal and consumer
data in a variety of its businesses. As data collection becomes more pervasive and the digital economy continues to
grow, we expect increased regulatory and social pressure on companies to ensure high standards of data integrity
and privacy. The European Union enacted GDPR in 2018 and we expect other jurisdictions to introduce
regulations on how companies use consumer data. Nielsen, as a leading data analytics company, will need to
ensure that it is ahead of these evolving regulatory and consumer trends so that it does not face any negative
effects on its business.
While risks for data analytic companies will continue to increase, we believe Nielsen has a strong record of
maintaining data integrity and privacy. Nielsen has a long history of collecting and monetizing consumer data in its
media and consumer retail businesses. Over the years, it has built a reputation as a trusted third-party source for
data analytics, which we believe helps its position with consumers, customers, and regulators as data privacy and
integrity issues become more prominent.

Issue Ratings - Recovery Analysis
Key analytical factors
• Our default risk factors include the following: a shift in the competitive landscape stemming from the proliferation of
media outlets and increased audience fragmentation, intensifying competition in both of the company's principal
segments, pressure on the company's revenues as clients demand more information for the same price,
higher-than-expected capital expenditures to boost the company's technical capabilities to ensure customer
satisfaction and preserve its competitive position, and the company facing financial strain from underperforming,
debt-financed acquisitions.
• As of June 30, 2019, Nielsen's debt capitalization included about $4.9 billion of senior secured credit facilities and
$4.2 billion of senior unsecured notes. Nielsen Finance LLC, TNC (US) Holdings Inc. (unrated), and Nielsen Holding
and Finance B.V. (unrated) are co-borrowers under the credit facilities, and Nielsen Finance LLC, Nielsen Finance
Co., and Nielsen Co. (Luxembourg) S.ar.l. are issuers of the senior notes. The credit facilities are secured by a lien
on substantially all of the co-borrowers and guarantors' capital stock, and tangible and intangible property (subject
to 65% of the voting stock of first-tier foreign subsidiaries and other excluded assets). The first-lien debt benefits
from a priority claim on the collateral. We assume the first-lien collateral accounts for about 60% of our estimated
emergence value.
• Nielsen's foreign operating subsidiaries do not guarantee the company's secured and unsecured debt. Therefore, the

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 16, 2019 10

Nielsen Holdings PLC

debt and other liabilities (including trade payables) of foreign operating subsidiaries could be effectively senior to the
claim of secured or unsecured lenders. In our recovery analysis, we assumed that most foreign subsidiaries would
continue to operate outside of bankruptcy, and foreign subsidiary liabilities would be unimpaired.
• We value the company on a going-concern basis given our expectation that, in event of a bankruptcy, the
reorganized company would benefit from its large market presence in TV audience measurement and from the
