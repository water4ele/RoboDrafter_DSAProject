SIBUR has access to competitively priced hydrocarbon feedstock. SIBUR Holding PJSC's feedstock is priced based on
export netbacks and at a significant discount to international prices. The proximity of the company's key production
assets to the suppliers eliminates most of the feedstock transportation costs and export duties. This leads to SIBUR's
above-average margins versus Europe, Middle East, And Africa (EMEA) chemical producers that S&P Global Ratings
has ratings on.
ZapSib's completion will bolster cash flows. We believe this project will allow the company to process an increased
share of natural gas liquids (NGL) and convert it into highly profitable polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP),
nearly tripling SIBUR's basic polymer capacity. This should result in reducing the company's exposure to oil price
volatility and lead to higher and more stable long-term earnings.
Exposure to Russian economy remains a constraint to the ratings. SIBUR's heavy presence in Russia exposes the
company to high foreign exchange volatility and significant cost inflation related to wages, utility costs, and transport.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects S&P Global Ratings' view that, based on SIBUR's strong profitability and improved cash
generation following the upcoming commissioning of the ZapSib project, the company will maintain an adjusted
funds from operations (FFO)-to-debt ratio above 45% on average, which we view as commensurate with a 'BBB-'
rating.

Downside scenario
Pressure on the rating could arise if we believe that SIBUR's average adjusted FFO-to-debt is likely to fall below
45% without a prospect of a swift recovery, or if its free operating cash flow (FOCF) remained negative. This could
result from a major drop in petrochemical prices coinciding with the company's decision for a more aggressive
financial policy or a large-scale debt-financed project.

Upside scenario
Upside potential for the rating could result from an even-more conservative financial policy and deleveraging to
achieve and maintain adjusted FFO-to-debt sustainably above 60%. Upside for the rating could also materialize if
the company solidifies its position and track record as one of the most profitable and resilient companies in our
petrochemicals rating universe.

• A decrease in adjusted capital expenditures (capex)
in 2020 to RUB90 billion from RUB135 billion in
2019 due to the ZapSib project's completion. We
factor in an increase in capex to RUB110
billion-RUB130 billion in subsequent years, to fund
initial spending on the Amur GCC project. Due to
the backend-loaded nature of these projects and the
potential shared burden in a joint-venture (JV)
structure, we believe our assumptions are rather
conservative and include some cushion
• Dividends of RUB 40 billion-RUB50 billion per year
over the forecast period, reflecting the company's
increased payout ratio (not less than 35% of
adjusted net income)
• SIBUR is considering undertaking another
multibillion-ruble project of similar size as ZapSib
and related to Gazprom's planned gas-processing
plant in the Amur region. While we don't expect a
decision before year's end, the company has signed
final ethane supply contracts with Gazprom and
term sheets regarding a potential JV partnership
with China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (Sinopec).
Capex requirements for this project could be
substantial, but would follow a backend-loaded
pattern similar to that observed with ZapSib.
Therefore, the initial capex we factor into our
base-case only modestly affects credit metrics after
2020, when ZapSib should ramp up and
meaningfully contribute to the company's cash flow
generation.

Base-case projections

SEPTEMBER 25, 2019 4

SIBUR Holding PJSC

EBITDA will improve after commissioning of ZapSibNeftekhim. We believe ZapSib's ramp-up will add significant and
highly profitable volumes, which would lead to improved EBITDA as the company's exposure to olefins and
polyolefins market increases.
Leverage will remain stable, even following the Amur Gas Plant's potential commissioning. We anticipate the
FFO-to-debt ratio will remain above 45%, even with the potential commissioning of Amur Gas plant; as the ZapSib
project start contributing to cash flows.

Company Description
SIBUR is the largest integrated gas processing and petrochemical company in Russia, and is headquartered in
Moscow. Its midstream segment accounts for about more than half of the group's sales and it operates the largest
infrastructure for processing associated petroleum gas (APG) in Western Siberia. It owns eight of the 10 gas processing
plants in the region that separate natural gas from raw NGL (a mix of heavier liquid petroleum gas [LPG] and naphtha
fractions). The group also sources large volumes of raw NGL, for which it has an extensive 1,600 kilometer pipeline
network and three gas-fractioning units that process raw NGL. Additional 820 kilometers of pipelines relate to APG,
and about 250 kilometers to natural gas.
SIBUR also holds leading positions in the domestic market in key petrochemical products produced by its
petrochemicals segment. These range from intermediates to plastics and organic synthesis products such as glycols,

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 25, 2019 5

SIBUR Holding PJSC

alcohols, and polyethylene terephthalate, through synthetic rubbers to polyolefins such as PE and PP. With the
commissioning of the world-scale ZabSib project in 2019, which has capacity of 2 million metric tons per year, the
petrochemicals segment will gain importance and we estimate its share in the group's sales could exceed 60% the
coming years. In 2018, SIBUR'S EBITDA was about RUB205 billion (US$3.0 billion) on revenue of about RUB569
billion (US$8.2 billion).
Chart 2

Business Risk: Fair
Our assessment of SIBUR's business risk as fair incorporates the size and diversity of the group across energy and
chemical products and end markets, as well as its access to competitively priced hydrocarbon feedstock in Western
Siberia. The feedstock is priced based on netbacks, which are significantly cheaper than international prices, given
export taxation and transport costs. This translates into a highly profitable midstream segment and a favorable
position on the global cost curve for key petrochemical products. In addition, the above-average profitability of plastics
and elastomers production in Russia is underpinned by the prevailing domestic shortage, and the absence of export
taxation on polymers. We also see the group's US$8.9 billon ZapSib project as having a strong rationale because it will
allow SIBUR to process an increased share of NGL and convert it into highly profitable polyethylene (PE) and

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 25, 2019 6

SIBUR Holding PJSC

polypropylene (PP), nearly tripling the company's basic polymer capacity. Positively, ZapSib will be positioned very
favorably at the first quartile of the global ethylene cost curve. We estimate SIBUR's existing petrochemicals assets in
the Tobolsk region operate with EBITDA margins above 45%.
SIBUR's exposure to Russian country risk is a credit weakness and the largest constraint on the company's business
risk profile, including significant cost inflation for wages, utility costs, and transport. Its operations are geographically
concentrated, with about 55% of sales and 100% of assets in Russia.
Additional business weaknesses include the petrochemical industry's cyclical and capital-intensive nature and the
sensitivity of SIBUR's profitability to oil prices. The correlation of the price of oil and the Russian ruble, which is a
significant factor in the company's cost structure, offsets this somewhat. We anticipate that the ZapSib project could
help reduce this sensitivity somewhat, resulting in more resilient profit generation. A secondary risk factor, in our view,
is some supplier concentration in the sourcing of APG. Again, the company has made progress in diversifying its
feedstock base with NGLs, which in 2018 represented more than 40% of the company's feedstock, up from only 20% in
2012. Finally, large-scale petrochemicals projects involve some degree of execution risk. However, the company has
built a track record of successfully completing large-scale petrochemical investments with the Tobolsk Polymer Plant
in 2013 and ZapSib in 2019 (95% completed as of March) and that the Amur Gas Chemical Complex (GCC) project will
likely happen with a JV.

Financial Risk: Modest
SIBUR credit metrics have materially strengthened over the past three years, not least because of its very high
EBITDA margins of over 35% on average. While we expect modestly weaker results in 2019 owing to lower global
petrochemical prices, ZapSib's completion on time and on budget in 2019 will mark a milestone in the company's
development. We anticipate that ZapSib will add significant sales volumes and improve SIBUR's overall profitability,
thanks to its significant size and favorable position on the global cost curve, while reducing the company's exposure to
oil price volatility. Based on higher FOCF generation from 2020 of over RUB100 million per year, we anticipate the
company's ratio of adjusted FFO-to-debt from 2020 will comfortably exceed 50%, as the current capex program is
ending and the ZapSib project will start contributing. Accordingly, we assess SIBUR's financial risk profile as modest.
At the same time, we believe that the company has sufficient headroom for new expansion projects, and in recent
years has maintained leverage in line with is financial policy despite major expansion projects.
SIBUR's profitability, with EBITDA margins well above 30%, is among the highest of the EMEA chemical producers we
rate. According to our estimates and company information, ZapSib's ramp-up will add significant and highly profitable
volumes that should sustainably increase the company's profitability. We see SIBUR's competitive position as
sustainable, owing to the high barriers to entry based on the extensive feedstock, gas-processing, and pipeline
infrastructure, which would require heavy investments for oil and gas producers. In addition, the company has
multiyear contracts (with a weighted-average maturity of 13.6 years) with key suppliers of associated petroleum gas,

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

such as Rosneft, RussNeft, and GazpromNeft. SIBUR's NGL pipeline links Novatek's Purovskiy gas condensate plant
with its main Tobolsk petrochemical complex. About 90% of NGL supplies are guaranteed under multiyear contracts
with a weighted-average maturity of 15.4 years.

Covenant Analysis
The company has ample headroom under the maintenance financial covenants in its loan and bond documentations
over the next 12 months.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

We consider SIBUR's exposure to environmental risk factors as moderately high. The company is building an
environmental management system of international standards and alignin its code of conduct with best practices.
SIBUR allocated RUB3.9 billion to various environmental protection activities in 2018, and RUB1.1 billion on
improving health and safety standards, and reduce its incident rate.
