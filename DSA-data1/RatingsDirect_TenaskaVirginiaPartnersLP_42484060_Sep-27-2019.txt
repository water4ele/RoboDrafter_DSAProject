Project Description
Tenaska Virginia Partners L.P. (TVP) operates an 885-megawatt (MW) combined-cycle gas- and oil-fired power plant
in Fluvanna County, Va. The project sells capacity and energy under a 20-year tolling agreement with Shell Energy
North America (US) L.P. (SENA; A+/Stable/--). Shell Oil Co. (AA-/Stable/A1+) fully guarantees, albeit conditionally,
SENA's obligations under an energy conversion agreement (ECA), subject to a limit of $1.17 billion that amortizes in
line with the bonds' scheduled redemption profile. General Electric Co. (GE; BBB+/Stable/A-2) provides maintenance
services under a long-term service agreement (LTSA). The project's developer, Tenaska, is an experienced project
developer that has constructed over 10,000 MW of generation capacity.

Overview
Key strengths

Key risks

Strong contractual foundation with no exposure of offtaker's dispatch decisions
and fuel expenses.

Possibility of mechanical failures that could lead to
underperformance.

Presence of a strong revenue counterparty and long-term service agreement
with GE.
Improving operating performance.

TVP has a strong contractual foundation (under its 20-year ECA with SENA) with no exposure to the offtaker's dispatch
decisions and fuel expenses. The project's capacity revenues under the ECA, at more than 80% of total revenues, are
sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service, thereby limiting sensitivity to the offtaker's dispatch decisions.
Moreover, there is no exposure to fuel expenses under the ECA, limiting cost volatility.
The project benefits from the presence of a strong revenue counterparty and long-term service agreement with GE.TVP
derives its revenues from—SENA, which is currently rated 'A+' with a stable outlook. To avoid any availability
penalties, it is critical that the project meet its peak and off-peak availability targets (97% and 94%, respectively) under
the ECA with SENA. To protect itself from the potential revenue loss from--and the high costs of--mechanical failures,
the project has an LTSA with GE, which covers the majority of planned major maintenance, unexpected repairs, and
non-availability penalties. The project also benefits from business-interruption insurance.

Operating performance is improving. In the past, the project has had unplanned outages in the ECA contract years
ending in May 2014, May 2015, and May 2016. However, the debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) was not affected, as
the LTSA and business-interruption insurance covered the cost of repairs and penalty payments. The project's
operating performance improved in the ECA contract years ending in May 2017, May 2018 and May 2019, with its
on-peak and off-peak availability above the ECA targets and no major outages. We do not expect the lengthy outages
witnessed from contract years May 2014 to May 2016 to re-occur.
The key credit risk is primarily tied to mechanical failures that could lead to underperformance relative to the project's
contractual obligations under the ECA. If the plant fails to meet the availability targets that are required within the
ECA, financial penalties could apply, which if not passed on to GE (due to issues not covered under the LTSA), could
lead to reduced cash flow available for debt service. Furthermore, high repair costs required to bring the plant back
online may also have a negative effect on cash flows. The project's resilient performance and DSCR under our
downside scenario mitigate this risk.

Outlook

The stable outlook reflects our expectation for the project's steady operating and financial performance given its
strong contractual foundation, stable capacity payments under the ECA, and availability above the target levels.
We expect the project will have minimum and average DSCRs of 1.42x and 1.46x, respectively, through the debt
term. The rating is not constrained by the rating on any counterparties.

Downside scenario
We could lower the rating if the project's long-term DSCR falls to the middle of the 'bb' category range (1.2x-1.4x)
on a sustained basis. This can happen if the project's has to consistently absorb availability penalties in excess of
$5.0 million. Higher non-availability penalties could stem from outages from non-turbine-related events or turbine
events that generated costs above GE's annual payment cap ($5.6 million in 2019). We could also lower the rating
if the rating on a key counterparty is lowered below that on the project.

Upside scenario
We could raise the rating if financial performance under our base case results in minimum DSCR close to the
middle of the 'bbb' category range (1.4x-2x) on a sustained basis over the remaining debt term. This would most
likely occur through the combination of the project achieving the highest levels of availability and reduction in its
operating costs.

Performance Update
The project's dispatch factor for the year ended Dec. 31, 2018, was around 75% compared with 78% in 2017. The
capacity factor does not have a material impact on financial profile as it is not sensitive to dispatch variance, with
capacity payments received from the offtaker being the biggest source of the project's cash flows.
The project's on-peak availability of 98.4% and off-peak availability of 97.5% for the contract year ended May 31, 2018,
were above the required targets of 97% and 94%, respectively. Our forecast assumes the outages seen in the

SEPTEMBER 17, 2019 3

Tenaska Virginia Partners L.P.

2014-2016 ECA contract years won't re-occur. However, we have included in our base case the penalties paid to the
offtaker to account for the project's performance in the past. These penalties, however, do not have a material impact
on the project's credit metrics.
In 2018, the project's DSCR of 1.54x remained higher than our forecast of 1.46x. This is primarily due to
lower-than-expected operations and maintenance (O&M) expenses (we factor availability penalties in our base case
forecast) and slightly higher capacity factor. We have revised our capacity-factor assumptions to around 73% over the
2019-2024 period (compared with our earlier forecast of 67.0%) and expect the project to have minimum DSCR of
1.42x over the debt term.

Key Metrics

• Fixed operations and management stress of 12%
over base case

• Minimum DSCR: 1.27x

• Availability stress of 6% below base case
• Cost inflation rate of 3% for the first five years of
forecast

• Average DSCR: 1.30x
• The project's performance under our downside case
results in DSCRs consistent with the 'a' category,
leading to a one-notch uplift for the preliminary
SACP. The adjusted SACP is therefore 'bbb'.

Peer Comparison
The peers closest to TVP are Tenaska Alabama II Partners LP (TAP II) and Kiowa Power Partners LLC. Similar to this
project, all of the peer projects are gas-fired power plants and have tolling agreements that result in zero market
exposure. These projects also have long-term service agreements for their equipment-related issues. The higher rating
on Kiowa Power Partners LLC reflects its higher DSCRs.

Operations phase SACP
• Our operating phase business assessment (OPBA) of '5' reflects the project's asset class as a natural-gas
combined-cycle power plant, its operating history, and contractual revenues with very limited market exposure.
• The minimum debt service coverage (DSC) of 1.42x under our base case leads to a preliminary operations phase
stand-alone credit profile (SACP) of 'bbb-'.
• The plant performs well in our downside case, primarily because it operates under a tolling agreement. It is not
exposed to fuel prices and volatility in some operating costs. The project's performance under our downside case
results in a DSCR consistent with the 'a' category, and so we raised our preliminary operations phase SACP by one
notch to 'bbb'.

Operations counterparties
We view SENA, which is both revenue and raw material counterparty, as irreplaceable. We also view GE, by virtue of
its status as the long-term servicer of the plant's turbines, as irreplaceable. We rate both entities well above the project
rating of 'BBB', and therefore they do not pose a significant risk to the rating at this time.
The project's balance of plant O&M is carried out by Tenaska Operations Inc. In this situation, O&M represents a
simple set of services with a wide number of alternatives available. In addition, the project has adequate liquidity to

Tenaska Virginia Partners L.P.

cover the operator's fees for one month. Hence, we consider O&M counterparty to be replaceable.

Liquidity
TVP's liquidity is typical for this type of project, and we assess it as neutral. The partnership has a letter of credit with
DZ Bank AG Deutsche Zentral-Genossenschaftsbank (DZ Bank; AA-/Stable/--) to cover its debt-service reserve
account obligations, with $24.1 million issued as of Dec. 31, 2018. The reserve covers six months of debt service. In
addition, the partnership has a working capital facility of $5 million, which had no funds drawn as of Dec. 31, 2018. At
that date, TVP also had $8.43 million of cash on hand. Instead of having a major maintenance reserve, the project
benefits from an LTSA with a skilled and creditworthy counterparty in GE.
