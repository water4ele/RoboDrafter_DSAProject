BorgWarner Inc. continues to grow faster than the overall market due in part to the launch of new programs in Europe
and North America and customer mix. In the second quarter, revenue rose approximately 540 basis points (bps) above
industry revenue growth. The company's light-vehicle sales in Europe increased 2% versus the industry decline by
more than 9%. North American light-vehicle sales were up 4%, outgrowing the market by 600 basis points. China sales
fell 10% versus a market sales decline of 16%. We believe the company will continue to grow 2019 sales a few
percentage points above the industry.
The company has been successfully pursuing a propulsion-agnostic product strategy. It can offer an array of powertrain
and drivetrain products for internal combustion, hybrid, and electric vehicles. It continues to strengthen its capability
in electric vehicle (EV) technology, including chargers, electric motors, transmissions, and power electronics. The
company recently entered into a joint venture with Romeo Power, a technology leader in battery management. We
expect very high annual growth for hybrid and EV sales over the next five years.
S&P Global Ratings expects the company's operating margin to be around 11.5% in 2019, below that achieved in 2018.
We are focused on the company's ability to reduce its cost structure in order to help offset the effect of declining
volumes, disappointing supply chain performance, tariffs, and disruption from supplier bankruptcies.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects S&P Global Ratings' view that BorgWarner's robust operating performance (driven by
tightening global regulations), strong financial metrics, and a conservative financial policy will enable it to
withstand potential slowdowns in global demand. Our base case assumes the company will remain committed to
balancing investments, dividends, and acquisitions while maintaining debt to EBITDA of less than 2x and free
operating cash flow (FOCF) to debt of more than 25% on a sustained basis. At the current rating, we believe the
company has sufficient free cash flow to accommodate some acquisitions and modest share buybacks.

Downside scenario
We could lower the rating on BorgWarner during the next two years if we see an increased likelihood of a
combination of adverse market conditions, large acquisitions, or share buybacks that would weaken the company's
credit measures to below what we see as commensurate for the rating. We could also lower the rating if debt
leverage were to rise to more than 2x or FOCF to debt were to fall to less than 25% on a sustained basis.

Upside scenario
An upgrade is unlikely during the next two years given the company's exposure to cyclical and highly competitive
end markets with potential swings in profitability. Over the longer term, however, the business profile could
potentially improve as the company enhances its scale and adds product diversity while sustaining FOCF/debt at
more than 40%.

Our Base-Case Scenario
Assumptions

• We expect U.S. GDP to grow by about 2.3% in 2019
and 1.8% in 2020, which is directionally consistent
with our outlook for light-vehicle production.
• We see light-vehicle production declining about 1%
in 2019 and 2020 in North America, decreasing 2.5%
in 2019 and increasing 2.9% in 2020 in Western
Europe, and falling 2.4% and rising 3.4% in Asia.
• Revenue growth of negative 3% in 2019 and positive
10% in 2020.

• Capital expenditures (capex) averaging 5%-6% of
sales annually.
• Acquisitions of less than $200 million in 2019.
• FOCF of at least $500 million annually.
• Share repurchases totaling at least $100 million in
2019.

Base-case projections
Our base-case projections for 2019 and 2020 assume debt to EBITDA at or below 1x and FOCF to debt greater than
35%.

Company Description
The company offers technology solutions for combustion, hybrid, and electric vehicles that improve vehicle
performance, propulsion efficiency, stability and air quality. These products are manufactured and sold worldwide,
primarily to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of light vehicles (passenger cars, sport-utility vehicles, vans, and
light trucks).

Business Risk: Satisfactory
We believe BorgWarner will continue to benefit from global efforts by virtually all developed markets to improve fuel
economy and reduce passenger vehicle emissions. This will lead to increased demand for the company's products that
improve engine and drivetrain efficiency. BorgWarner's technologically advanced products and established record of
successful innovation support EBITDA margins that, in our view, compare favorably with those of nearly all rated auto
suppliers.

SEPTEMBER 12, 2019 4

BorgWarner Inc.

We expect BorgWarner's financial results to benefit from continuing application of turbochargers by automakers for
both diesel engines, albeit facing declining demand in Europe, and gasoline engines. In the U.S., we expect the trend of
shifting to smaller engines for fuel efficiency to provide growth for BorgWarner's turbocharger products.
BorgWarner's product sales have historically outpaced market growth in Europe, and we expect this trend to continue
through 2019 and into 2020. Europe is BorgWarner's largest market, representing about 38% of estimated 2018 sales.
Despite a risk of production volume declines, the ratings reflect our assumption that the company can achieve good
EBITDA margins because of solid capacity utilization on higher revenues and ongoing cost-cutting.
We believe the company's large backlog means its products are being added to vehicles. BorgWarner projects $2.0
billion-$2.4 billion of net new business revenues from 2019 through 2021, about 15% of which would be in Europe,
60% in Asia, and 25% in the Americas. However, as with most auto suppliers, new business projections depend heavily
on production volumes and could be lower if volumes decrease.
We assess management and governance as strong, based on specific financial and operational goals with clear
measures of achievement. BorgWarner's business strategy is nearly always consistent with its capabilities, and the
company has a record of market leadership and effective innovation. Management has instituted policies that
effectively identify, monitor, and mitigate key risks. Management has also set rigorous but reasonable standards for
operational performance and has considerable expertise, experience, and a history of success in operating all of its
major lines of business.

Financial Risk: Modest
BorgWarner's financial risk profile reflects the company's continuing strong credit measures, which provide some
cushion for underperformance in the case of a significant demand downturn in the auto industry.
As of June 30, 2019, total debt to EBITDA was 1.2x and FOCF to debt was 41.5%. For the current rating, we expect
debt to EBITDA to be less than 1.5x and FOCF to debt to be at least greater than 25% in 2019 and 2020. We believe
further strategic acquisitions to support above-average industry growth with electrification technologies could limit any
meaningful debt reduction.

Liquidity: Strong
We consider BorgWarner's liquidity to be strong. We believe BorgWarner can more than cover its needs for the next
two years, even if EBITDA were to decline 30% from our assumed level. We also assume the ratio of sources to uses
will exceed 1.5x-2.0x. The company has good relationships with its banks and good standing in credit markets, in our
view, based on recent capital-markets transactions. However, we do not believe BorgWarner's qualitative liquidity
factors support an even stronger assessment.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Availability of $1.2 billion, as of June 30, 2019, under
its multicurrency revolving credit facility that
provides backup to the $1.2 billion commercial
paper program; the total combined borrowing
capacity under the multicurrency revolver and
commercial paper program cannot exceed $1.2
billion;

• The nearest debt maturities are the $134 million 8%
senior notes due in October 2019 and $250 million
of 4.625% senior notes due in September 2020; and
• We assume capital spending between 5% and 6% of
total revenue in 2019.

• $710 million of cash, as of June 30, 2019, mostly
held outside the U.S.; and
• Funds from operation (FFO) of about $1.3 billion in
2019 and $1.5 billion in 2020.

Covenant Analysis
Compliance expectations
The company was in compliance with its financial covenant at June 30,2019 and we expect it to remain compliant
over the next few years.

Requirements
We expect more than adequate cushion on its key financial covenant as part of the credit agreement that it maintain a
debt-to-EBITDA ratio of no higher than 3.25x.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

We expect BorgWarner to spend about 4% of its revenue on research and development (R&D) and 5%-6% of its
revenue on capex in current and future years, to remain competitive and provide the technology to help OEMs
stay in compliance with prevailing emissions regulations. R&D expenditure as a percentage of sales is generally
below the level of global European and Japanese auto suppliers.
Social factors do not play a major role in our ratings on BorgWarner. We believe the company's reserves are
sufficient to cover the costs of litigation.
We see BorgWarner's management and governance as satisfactory, reflecting its success in implementing its
strategic plans, its operational expertise, and management depth and breadth.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
BorgWarner's capital structure consists of a $1.2 billion multicurrency revolving facility that backdrops its commercial
paper program. The company also has long-term debt consisting of $2 billion in senior unsecured notes.

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 12, 2019 8

BorgWarner Inc.

Analytical conclusions
We rate BorgWarner's unsecured debt 'BBB+', the same as the issuer credit rating, because no significant elements of
subordination risk are present in the company's capital structure.
