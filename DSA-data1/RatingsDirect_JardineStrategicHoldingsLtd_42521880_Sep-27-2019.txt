Overview
Key strengths

Key risks

Strong market position in most of the businesses under the
group's operating companies.

Material exposure to Indonesia could increase volatility and sensitivity to
macroeconomic conditions there.

Diverse operations both geographically across Asia and by
industry.

Revenue growth profile weaker than the blended GDP of the countries in
which it operates.

Stable operating cash flows and strong liquidity.
Long history of prudent financial management.

We forecast that the investment cycle of Jardine Matheson--the holding company of Jardine Strategic Holdings
Ltd.--has peaked and expect investments to moderate in 2019. After high investment spending over the past two years,
we believe Jardine's investment appetite has moderated. This is reflected in the distinct drop in investment spending in
the first half of 2019 at key operating subsidiaries Hongkong Land Holdings Ltd. and PT Astra International Tbk. We
assume maintenance capital expenditure (capex) and expansionary capex of US$1.5 billion–US$1.8 billion each
annually. This compares to aggregate capex of US$4.7 billion in 2018 and about US$4.5 billion in 2017.

Chart 1

We believe Jardine will uphold its prudent financial policy and has no appetite for higher leverage. We consider the
increase in investment spending as part of management's strategy formulated in 2017 and 2018 to increase exposure
to the property sector in Greater China and achieve greater diversification within Indonesia. We believe the group does
not have a high appetite for debt-funded investments. The sale of Jardine Lloyd Thompson in 2019 for US$2.1 billion
helped to offset the heavy spending at Hongkong Land and Astra in the past two years.
Jardine's earnings diversity, entrenched market positions, and brand equity should support its operations even in
volatile market conditions. We expect Jardine to maintain strong market positions across its various operating
companies. Hongkong Land's "Grade A" offices mixed with high-end retail properties in Central, Hong Kong, and in
the central business district in Singapore provide steady investment income. At Astra, growth in heavy equipment
supported by the ongoing recovery in mining contracts will help offset the decline in automotive volumes. We believe
the group's underlying business strengths will provide some stability to cash flows and earnings resilience through
economic cycles.

Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our view that Jardine will uphold its conservative financial policy and limit debt growth
after two years of high investment. We expect the group's debt-to-EBITDA ratio to remain below 2.0x for the next
24 months. At the same time, we believe the group's earnings diversity, entrenched market positions, and brand
equity would support its operations despite likely more volatile market conditions.

Downside scenario
We may lower the rating if the group's risk appetite increases, such that its debt-to-EBITDA ratio exceeds 2.0x.
This may happen if: (1) the group's debt-funded expansion and shareholder distributions are more aggressive than
we anticipated; or (2) sustained competition or eroding demand in key markets and volatility in working capital
movements undermine the group's operating cash flows.

Upside scenario
Rating upside is limited for the next 24 months. We may raise the rating if Jardine strengthens its business
fundamentals while maintaining low leverage. This may happen if the competitive positioning and diversity of the
company's various subsidiaries improve such that revenue growth and margin improvement are significantly above
our base case on a sustainable basis.

Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd.

Assumptions

• For 2019 and 2020, real GDP growth of 6.2% in
China, 5.1% and 5.2% in Indonesia, 2.2% and 2.4%
in Hong Kong, and 2.3% and 2.4% in Singapore.
• Jardine's revenue to increase 0.5%-1.0% in 2019 and
2.5%-3.0% in 2020, weaker than the GDP growth in
the respective countries.
• EBITDA margins to decrease to 12.0%-12.5% in
2019 and 2020, from 14.6% in 2018.

• Capex of US$1.5 billion-US$1.8 billion in 2019 and

• Acquisitions to decrease to US$1.5 billion-US$1.8
billion in 2019 and 2020, from about US$2.9 billion
in 2018, given no significant investments over this
period.
• Dividend payments of US$1.2 billion–US$1.4 billion
annually in 2019 and 2020.

Base-case projections
We expect Jardine's revenue growth to be weaker than the GDP growth of the respective countries in which it operates.
The group has high market shares in maturing industries, such as consumer retail, real estate, auto retail, and heavy
equipment. We expect strong growth in the heavy equipment business in Indonesia. However, we forecast this will be
offset by weaker automotive sales in Indonesia and slower retail sales in Hong Kong, Singapore, and China amid
intense competition in retail. Real estate revenues will dip in 2019 owing to the high base in 2018 from the delivery of
the Sol Acres residential property in Singapore. Real estate revenue will rebound by 1%-3% from 2020, following
recognition of revenue from project deliveries mainly in China.
We expect EBITDA margins to decrease slightly, weighed down by lower-margin acquisitions at Astra. We believe this
is attributable to recent acquisitions--such as the Martabe gold mine and toll roads--that resulted in a lower blended
EBITDA margin.
We do not expect significant investments in the next 24 months. At Hongkong Land, one new development property
project was added in the first half of 2019, compared with five in the same period of 2018. At Astra, investments in
2018 were largely driven by the US$1.14 billion acquisition of the Martabe gold mine. The absence of such spending
has resulted in a natural drop in investments. We expect the group to sustain its conservative risk appetite as it digests
recent investments.

Company Description
Hong Kong-based Jardine is a business conglomerate focused on Asia. The company has a standard listing on the
London Stock Exchange, with secondary listings in Bermuda and Singapore. Jardine Matheson is the holding company
of the group.

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 24, 2019 6

Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd.

The group's operating companies are engaged in property investment and development, food retailing, home
furnishings, restaurants, luxury hotels, motor vehicles and related operations, financial services, heavy equipment,
mining and agribusiness, engineering and construction, and transport services.
Jardine is 85% held by Jardine Matheson, which is in turn 58% owned by Jardine. The cross-shareholding allows the
group to take a long-term view of its business interests and help maintain the policy and ownership continuity.

Business Risk: Strong
In our view, Jardine's good business and geographic diversity, solid market position, and well-entrenched brand name
in each of its key businesses underpin its competitive positioning.
We expect Hongkong Land to remain resilient to downcycles and deliver satisfactory operating performance in 2019.
Hongkong Land's strong market position is supported by its high asset quality in prime locations mainly in Hong Kong
and Singapore), well-diversified tenant mix, and well-managed lease maturity profile. While operating profits for
development properties (including share of JV projects) increased to US$193 million in the first half of 2019, from
US$148 million in the first half of 2018, we expect development property revenue to further pick up in the second half.
This is suggested by the company's solid project pipeline and satisfactory unbooked revenue (from the China and
Singapore portfolio) for recognition in the second half of 2019.
At Astra, we expect the Indonesian subsidiary to benefit from its dominant market share in key businesses and good
diversity across three major earnings contributors: automobile, heavy equipment and mining, and financial services. In
the automobile segment, Astra holds significant market share in the retail of four-wheelers (53%) and two-wheelers
(75%) in Indonesia, backed by its exclusive distribution rights for Toyota and Honda in the country. In the heavy
equipment segment, Astra commands a domestic market share of about 36% owing to its exclusive distribution rights
with top brands such as Komatsu and long-standing relationship with its large customers.
We expect the reorganization at subsidiary Dairy Farm International Holdings Ltd. to have a slight positive impact on
its segment margin in the next 24 months. Jardine plans to integrate all of Dairy Farm's back-end operations into a
single structure from a multi-geography hierarchy. This will improve group control and Dairy Farm's bargaining power
thanks to benefits from economies of scale resulting from the introduction of central procurement. We believe the
replacement of the majority of senior management at Dairy Farm with industry veterans will help to halt the revenue
decline in the food business.
The vast expanse of Jardine's business across different geographies and segments will continue to create a competitive
advantage for the group. We believe the group's earnings profile is highly resilient with steady growth prospects
because of a good mix of stable businesses such as property leasing and retail (health and beauty/groceries), which
offset more volatile heavy equipment and mining businesses. In addition, the group's geographic diversity across a
number of developed countries offsets volatility in Indonesia. We expect Jardine to maintain this diversity and
earnings quality over the next three years.

We consider CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd., Swire Pacific Ltd., and Wesfarmers Ltd. as Jardine's peers because they are
all diversified conglomerates. We believe CK Hutchison is the closest peer to Jardine because it is a Hong Kong-based
conglomerate with diversified businesses. Over 60% of Swire's earnings are from REITs and about 80% of Wesfarmers'
earnings are from retail.
All companies have strong market positions, satisfactory brand names, and good track records of execution in their
respective markets and business lines. Swire has an edge being the holder of exclusive rights to manufacture, market,
and distribute products of The Coca-Cola Co. Wesfarmers and CK Hutchison have better diversity in business
segments and geography compared to Jardine. Furthermore, Jardine has exposure to operations with higher cash flow
volatility such as auto retailing, heavy equipment, and construction in Indonesia.
Jardine's track record of prudent financial management results in better financial leverage metrics than peers', despite
a recent increase in the company's investment appetite.

Financial Risk: Modest
We expect Jardine's leverage to peak in 2019 such that its debt-to-EBITDA ratio remains below 2.0x over the next 24
months.
We believe Jardine's prudent financial policy and strict risk management are deeply rooted across the group.
Although working capital swings can result in greater cash flow volatility for the group, we see this risk as manageable.
The volatility is largely attributable to Astra's significant working capital requirements related to inventory
management at the automobile and mining equipment segments. When demand falls short of expectations, Astra can
manage working capital outflows by revising volumes in its agreements with original equipment manufacturers
(OEMs). We also note that Astra's strict hedging policies to reduce cash flow mismatch in times of volatile movements

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 24, 2019 9

Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd.

for currency, interest rates, and commodity prices will help to manage sharp price movements.
We exclude financial services in our debt calculation. This is because we believe the benefits and risks of Astra's
captive finance companies based on its asset quality and leverage profile are captured in the group's business and
financial risk profile.

Liquidity: Strong
We assess Jardine's liquidity as strong based on the group's large cash position, solid operating cash flow, and
well-managed debt maturity profile. We expect the group's ratio of liquidity sources to uses to be above 1.5x in the 24
months ending Dec. 31, 2020. We exclude financial services' cash and debt from our liquidity assessment because that

segment is self-sustaining and non-recourse to the group.
Jardine has a long track record of maintaining strong liquidity. We believe the company's low debt leverage and high
cash generation provide it with enough buffer to withstand low probability but material events that affect liquidity.
Jardine has low-cost bank and public debt, a long track record of good access to capital markets and bank lines, and a
history of maintaining its good credit rating. All of these factors point to the company's financial flexibility and good
access to liquidity support.
