Overview
Key Strengths

Key Risks

Strong market position in Hong Kong with a long operating history in property
development and investment.

Lack of land replenishment in Hong Kong to sustain pipeline
and market presence.

Sizable low-cost land bank in China to support property sales and profitability.

Uncertainties related to identifying and executing accretive,
stable acquisitions.

Growing recurring income from diversified, non-property assets.

Debt-funded acquisitions that are more aggressive than we
anticipate.

Consistently strong liquidity thanks to excellent cash generation capability and
prudent financial management.

CK Asset Holdings Ltd.'s market position in Hong Kong's property sector remains strong despite the lack of
replenishment to its development pipeline. We expect CK Asset to maintain steady property sales in Hong Kong over
the next two to three years. Its pipeline beyond that period will depend on the replenishment of its land bank. We
forecast CK Asset to achieve contracted sales of Hong Kong dollar (HK$) 13 billion-15 billion in 2019 and HK$23
billion–25 billion in 2020, supported by sizable projects at Borrett Road, Lohas Park, and Wong Chuk Hang Station.
However, the company has been relatively muted in the land market in the past several years. As of June 30, 2019, it
had only 4 million square feet of development land bank in Hong Kong. We believe the company's presence in Hong
Kong's property development market will gradually diminish if it does not acquire more land.
CK Asset's active asset allocation across diversified non-property investments enhances cash flow stability, although
uncertainties related to returns and execution exist. In our view, CK Asset will continue to actively manage its asset
portfolio to enhance cash flow stability, but there are uncertainties in identifying accretive opportunities and executing
the acquisitions. Over the past two years, the company had expanded beyond its property business in Hong Kong and
China and invested in global assets that generate stable cash flow. These include aircraft leasing, infrastructure and
utilities, and most recently a brewer and pub operator. While this has diversified CK Asset's earnings stream and
reduced its business concentration, we believe that event risks stemming from acquisitions will linger as the company
continues to optimize its portfolio.

CK Assets's continued strong liquidity and prudent financial management could mitigate potential risks from sizable
acquisitions. In our view, CK Asset's high cash balance, limited near-term maturities, and track record of financial
prudence will help the company capture acquisition opportunities while minimizing potential risks. The company has
HK$58.5 billion in unrestricted cash as of June 30, 2019, compared with near-term debt repayable of HK$3.7 billion. It
has also historically managed its balance sheet well. We believe CK Asset has an appetite for sizable investments and
may significantly increase leverage beyond its current level to seize appealing opportunities. We capture this potential
risk in our negative modifier on financial policy. That said, CK Asset has ample rating buffer against downside
pressure.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on CK Asset reflects our expectation that the company will continue to recycle capital to
expand its recurring income streams while maintaining its financial strength over the next 12-24 months. In
addition, we expect the company's property development and rental businesses to remain steady over the next two
to three years.

Downside scenario
We may lower the rating if: (1) CK Asset's investment appetite is significantly more aggressive or riskier than we
expect, or (2) the company encounters a severe market downturn that materially hurts its key business segments.
An indicator of this could be a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of more than 3.5x and EBITDA interest coverage falling to
below 10x.

Upside scenario
We may raise the rating if CK Asset commits to a lower investment appetite, such that the company's
debt-to-EBITDA ratio stays below 1.5x on a sustained basis.

• China's residential property sales to increase by
12%-15% in 2019, driven by a 2%-3% growth in
gross floor area and a 10%-12% rise in the average
selling price.
• CK Asset's revenue to rebound to HK$78
billion-HK$80 billion in 2019 and HK$70
billion–HK$72 billion in 2020 as the booking of
property sales in Hong Kong and China increases.
• The company's contracted sales in Hong Kong to
remain at HK$13 billion-HK$15 billion in 2019 and
rise to HK$23 billion–HK$25 billion in 2020.
Contracted sales in China to grow to HK$27
billion-HK$29 billion in 2019 and HK$34
billion–HK$36 billion in 2020.
• Rental income growth to decline slightly by 0%-5%
in 2019, owing to the sale of The Center in Hong
Kong, before growing 5%-10% in 2020.
• Hotel, aircraft leasing, and property management
income to grow organically by 5%-10% to HK$8
billion-HK$9 billion in 2019 and 2020.
• EBITDA margin to fall to 39%-41% in 2019 and
2020, owing to the shift in revenue mix away from
high-margin rental income as booking of property
sales increases.
• Construction costs of HK$15 billion-HK$17 billion in
2019 and HK$17 billion-HK$19 billion in 2020.
• Spending on land acquisition and new investment of
about HK$28 billion in 2019 and about HK$25
billion in 2020. We expect little land acquisition
spending in Hong Kong and China as CK Asset
continues to seek investments in other assets with
steady revenue streams.
• Modest increase in adjusted debt to HK$58

billion-HK$60 billion in 2019, from HK$54 billion in
2018, before falling to HK$50 billion-HK$52 billion
in 2020.

Base-case projections
High visibility in revenue from considerable unbooked sales. We see strong visibility in CK Asset's revenue in 2019 and
2020, given the presence of HK$53.5 billion sales contracted but not yet recognized as of June 30, 2019. We expect
property sales to account for 75%-80% of revenue in the coming two years.
Our base-case forecast has not factored in the proposed acquisition of Greene King as the deal is still subject to
shareholders' approval. However, the consideration of HK$25.2 billion is included in our expenditure budget. On a
2018 pro-forma basis, we estimate that CK Asset's debt-to-EBITDA ratio would have been higher at 2.5x-3.0x,
compared with 2.1x in 2018.

Company Description
CK Asset primarily engages in the development and sale of properties, and investment in properties for rental in Hong
Kong and China. The company also has property businesses overseas. Since 2017, CK Asset has been diversifying into
segments that generate recurring income, including aircraft leasing, infrastructure, and utilities.
Listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange since June 2015, CK Asset, formerly known as Cheung Kong Property, was
formed following the reorganization of the erstwhile Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd. and Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., and
holds their property businesses.

Business Risk: Strong
Our assessment on CK Asset primarily reflects the company's strong market position in its property sales and rental
businesses. Other new nonproperty investments, despite offering some degree of diversification, remain relatively
small in scale compared with the property businesses. We believe that in the absence of any major new asset
acquisition, its property segments will continue to be the main income contributor in the coming two years.
We see some pressure in CK Asset achieving our base case of HK$13 billion-HK$15 billion in Hong Kong property
sales in 2019, given the likely delay in new project launches due to market uncertainties. Nonetheless, we believe that
the two mass-market projects, namely Seaside Sonata and Sea To Sky, will be less affected than the luxury Borrett
Road project. In the first six months of 2019, the company sold only about HK$3 billion of properties in Hong Kong.
We expect CK Asset to continue to optimize its investment property portfolio to enhance returns. Following the
disposal of The Center in Hong Kong, the company reinvested part of the proceeds into offices in London and Dublin.
In addition, the company is redeveloping Hutchison House in Hong Kong, and has obtained approvals to rebuild hotels
and serviced apartments in Hong Kong into grade-A offices.

SEPTEMBER 22, 2019 8

CK Asset Holdings Ltd.

We believe that CK Asset's infrastructure and utilities joint ventures and investments will continue to contribute stable
cash flow in the form of dividends and interest income. We also expect recurring income from its aircraft leasing
division to grow steadily in the coming two years as its fleet expands. As of June 30, 2019, the fleet portfolio consisted
of 134 aircraft. These nonproperty assets will continue to add stability and diversity to CK Asset's traditional property
businesses.
The recent proposed acquisition of Greene King PLC, a U.K.-based brewer and pub operator, echoes our view that CK
Asset is poised for sizable opportunities to rebalance its portfolio toward businesses that generate steady cash flow.
Greene King has been resilient over economic downturns, demonstrated by its ability to maintain positive cash flow
and dividends during past downturns.

In terms of property development, we consider Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. (SHKP; A+/Stable/--) as CK Asset's
closest peer. Both companies are top property developers in Hong Kong with strong brand recognition. However, CK
Asset has greater diversity in terms of business segments and geographies.
Compared with CK Asset, SHKP's stronger business profile is supported by a more stable development pipeline and
adequate land bank, premium pricing power, and a higher-quality investment property portfolio. CK Asset has more
exposure to property development and sales in China, while SHKP mainly builds and owns integrated commercial
complexes on the mainland.
However, in terms of diversification, CK Asset has a more diversified nonproperty asset portfolio. Although SHKP also
holds a few key nonproperty businesses in the telecommunications, retail, and infrastructure sectors, these businesses
are all located in Hong Kong and are small in scale. In contrast, CK Asset's nonproperty businesses comprise more
diversified interests in a portfolio of ventures located in Australia, Canada, and Europe.
Both CK Asset and SHKP demonstrate a long track record of financial prudence, financial flexibility, high standing in
the capital market, as well as strong banking relationships.
We also view Nan Fung International Holdings Ltd. (BBB-/Stable/--) and China Resources Land Ltd. (CR Land;
BBB+/Stable/--) as CK Asset's peers. Besides being property developers with long operating records in Hong Kong,
both CK Asset and Nan Fung have considerable nonproperty assets, while CK Asset and CR Land engage in property
development and sales in China.
In terms of exposure to nonproperty businesses, CK Asset's nonproperty ventures include aircraft leasing,
infrastructure, and utilities, while Nan Fung holds a sizable securities investment portfolio that is liquid and offers
additional financial flexibility. Nan Fung has a smaller operating scale, mainly owing to its weaker presence in China
and smaller investment properties portfolio.
CK Asset's operations in China is smaller in scale and less geographically diversified than CR Land's. CR Land is one of
the top 10 developers in China with a nationwide footprint across 70 cities. In comparison, CK Asset is focused on a
few selected cities. While CR Land owns a portfolio of quality shopping malls in China that generates rental income, its
revenue is still predominantly driven by property sales. CK Asset has a better balance between property development
and recurring income.
CK Asset's leverage is the lowest among all its peers, mainly because of subdued land acquisition and asset investment
over the past two years. SHKP more steady capital expenditure on land replenishment and construction, which is
reflected in its higher leverage. CR Land's leverage is higher than the two Hong Kong companies, but remains centrally
controlled by China. Nan Fung has the highest financial leverage, following the undertaking of the sizable commercial
project in Kai Tak.

Financial Risk: Modest
In our base-case scenario, we forecast CK Asset's debt-to-EBITDA ratio to improve slightly to 1.8x-2.0x in 2019 and
1.7x-1.9x in 2020, from 2.1x in 2018, without considering any major asset investments. This is supported by CK Asset's
stable cash flow from rental and nonproperty ventures, as well as strong property sales recognition over the coming
two years. We expect the company's see-through leverage to be moderately higher at 2.4x-2.6x in 2019 and 2020, as
we proportionately consolidate CK Asset's share of joint ventures and associates' EBITDA and debt. The company's
transparency in off-balance financials is sound in our view.
We believe CK Asset will continue to seek investment opportunities to redeploy its substantial war chest to enhance
returns, and potentially increase leverage to acquire sizable projects. Our rating on CK Asset has already factored in
this possibility; CK Asset has ample buffer against rating downside. We also expect CK Asset to continue its disciplined
approach in investments that expand its recurring income base.
CK Asset faces limited near-term repayment pressure. It has HK$59.4 billion in cash as of June 30, 2019, while HK$3.7
billion of borrowings will mature in the 12 months to June 2020. The company has a healthy weighted average
maturity of 3.6 years and a funding cost of 2.8% as of Dec. 31, 2018.

Liquidity: Strong
We assess that CK Asset has strong liquidity, based on its high cash balance, strong cash flows, and committed
undrawn credit lines. We expect the group's cash sources to be more than 2.0x its cash uses in 2019 and 2020. While
this level is commensurate with a higher liquidity score, our assessment reflects the company's investment appetite
and probability of acquisition spending beyond our assumption.
In our view, CK Asset has strong banking relationships and capital market access, as well as prudent financial and
liability management. These strengths should support the group's refinancing needs. The company's principal banks
include international Japanese lenders, such as Mizuho Bank and MUFG Bank, and local banks. Bank loans accounted
for over 85% of total borrowings as of end-2018. CK Asset also issued HK$2 billion notes with a 10-year term under
the Euro Medium Term Note program in September 2018. These strengths should support the group's refinancing
needs.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Unrestricted cash balance of HK$55.4 billion as of
end-2018.

• Debt due in 2019 of HK$1.8 billion.

• Funds from operations over the 12 months to
December 2019 of HK$29 billion-HK$31 billion,
estimated by: (1) cash received from contracted
sales of HK$44 billion-HK$46 billion; (2) cash
received from rental and other businesses of HK$22
billion-HK$24 billion; (3) construction cost of HK$15
billion-HK$17 billion; (4) selling, general, and
administrative expenses, tax, interest and other

Covenant Analysis
CK Asset has certain balance sheet covenants on its bank loan facilities. In our view, the group has ample room to
meet these covenants.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

CK Asset has managed its environmental footprint throughout its property business operations and requires
external contractors to minimize their carbon footprint, air emissions, and waste during construction of projects. Its
property management subsidiaries also adopt various energy- and water-saving practices and the company
participated in the Charter on External Lighting for prominent commercial properties. Although property
development can mean environmental risks, they are not material rating factors. CK Asset faces regulatory and
reputation risk, which might affect the company's viability and profitability. To mitigate the potential impact, CK
Asset maintains safety standards through regular construction site inspections and continuously enhances product
quality with customer feedback. The company also adopts high standards across its property management and
commercial property divisions. While the Li family is a majority shareholder, the company has an adequate
corporate framework and oversight by independent directors. In addition, it also been timely and transparent in
delivering information to shareholders. Its former chairman transitioning into a senior adviser post after retirement
also highlights clear succession plans.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
CK Asset's leverage is low enough to limit the possibility of any senior unsecured debtholders being significantly
disadvantaged relative to other debtholders.

Analytical conclusions
We do not view CK Asset's capital structure as having any material risks such as structural or contractual
subordination. The issue rating is therefore consistent with our 'A' issuer credit rating.
