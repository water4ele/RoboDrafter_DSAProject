Project Description
Newcastle Coal Infrastructure Group (NCIG) operates a coal export terminal located in the Port of Newcastle on the
central coast in the State of New South Wales. The multi-user terminal has an approved capacity of 66 million metric
tons per annum (mtpa). It is fully contracted under 10-year, evergreen ship-or-pay contracts. NCIG commenced
operations in 2010 under a lease from Newcastle Port that expires in 2043, and NCIG holds a 10-year extension
option. NCIG is 100% mutually owned by most of its shippers.
As of June 30, 2019, NCIG had approximately US$2.16 billion of senior secured debt and its parent, NCIG Holdings

Stable cash flow with cost pass-through. Revenues (via the toll charges) are structured to cover the terminal's operating
and finance costs. The terminal's take-or-pay agreements with shippers are 10-year evergreen contracts and all
operating costs can be passed through to shippers on an uncapped basis. Finance costs can be passed through to
shippers subject to a cap, while no dividends are paid or payable. The current finance toll charge is about A$5 per ton
compared with the cap of about A$10 per ton. We base our assessment on an assumed finance cap of about A$7 per
ton, considering assumed break-even prices for miners. The socialization mechanism, whereby lost revenue from a
shipper can be spread across the other shippers, provides further protection against the loss of other shippers.
One of two coal export terminals in the Port of Newcastle. NCIG is one of two terminals handling coal delivered from
the Hunter Valley coal basin for export. Contracted demand for capacity is full at both terminals. NCIG's shippers'
source mines are characterized by attractive product quality and have relatively large marketable reserve bases that
underpin long mine lives.
Limited recontracting risk. The contractual structure of NCIG is slightly stronger relative to peers because the
contracts limit any contract renewal risk, given that they are evergreen in nature. Nonrenewal by a shipper would lead
to a requirement to repay the shipper's share of the project debt. We consider all shippers to be replaceable, and
therefore, assume no material shipper revenue risk or counterparty dependency.
Refinance risk. All of NCIG's bank debt facilities have scheduled amortization profiles specified in the documentation.
While there are no covenants mandating amortization on NCIG's nonbank debt, NCIG has had in place a
board-approved policy and practice since 2013 to structure the overall amortization profile such that senior debt will
be fully repaid by 2038. In the most recent refinancing, NCIG replaced a bullet repayment U.S. private placement (PP)
facility with amortizing bank debt facilities. The numerous debt tranches spread the refinancing risk over various time
periods.
Longer term exposure to the coal sector. While Chinese demand for coal may be moderating, we expect increasing
demand in other parts of Asia, including India, to continue to support the Australian coal export market. Over the
longer term, demand for coal relative to renewables is likely to fall, even from Asia, as economies transition to more
environmentally friendly sources of fuel for energy.

Outlook

The stable outlook for both the senior and junior debt reflects our view that the terminal will operate at a
contracted capacity of 66 mtpa for the foreseeable future. Demand for throughput may begin to slightly exceed
current contracted capacity within a few years. NCIG is able to operate in excess of its contracted capacity at up to
75 mtpa, but would need environmental authority approval to do so.
In addition, we consider NCIG would continue to manage the ship-or-pay contracts such that it generates stable
cash flow and makes timely cash calls to cover any unbudgeted costs. We would expect any future rating
movement to be slightly different across the senior and junior debt because the senior debt would benefit more
from a higher assumed toll charge and is also more resilient to downside risks. This view reflects the relative size of
the senior and junior debt, and the fact that our forecast revenue profile is based on an assumed finance charge
(that could be borne by shippers) rather than the actual toll charge, which is sized to cover operating and finance
costs.

Downside scenario
The ratings would come under pressure if contracted volumes were to drop or if the fundamental competitiveness
of the Hunter Valley coal market, including demand and price, were to materially decline. Such conditions may
lead us to reduce our expected maximum toll charge. In particular, a minimum senior debt service coverage ratio
(DSCR) declining below 1.60x with no prospect of timely recovery above that level could result in a lowering of the
senior rating.
Downward rating momentum for both the senior and junior debt could also occur if we consider that shippers can't
be easily replaced or if the project were to materially defer the amortization profile of the senior debt. In addition,
we could lower the ratings if NCIG fails to appropriately manage its refinance exposure and refinance its bullet
maturities well ahead of time.

Upside scenario
An upgrade is unlikely over the next 12 months. A higher rating for both the senior and junior debt could result
from a sustained increase in coal prices over the next two to three years, boosting margins for the mines in the
region, along with strong growth in actual tonnage throughput. Any such strengthening in coal industry conditions
may increase our expected maximum toll charge for NCIG.

Performance Update
NCIG's throughput for the year ended June 30, 2019, was approximately 53mt, consistent with that in the previous
financial year. Operating costs have remained largely steady given the stable throughput, which is credit neutral
because operating costs are passed on to the shippers in the toll charge.
NCIG completed a notional US$340 million refinancing in June 2019, establishing commitments to replace USPP and
bank debt with bank debt. The new committed facility is to be used for repayment of Bank Facility D (repaid in June

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

Newcastle Coal Infrastructure Group Pty Ltd.

2019), and the USPP notes due December 2019 (about US$135 million) and November 2020 (about US$25 million).
We note that this new facility does not result in an increase in total debt because it can only be drawn to repay existing
debt.

S&P Global Ratings Base Case
Assumptions
• Operating cost component of the toll charge based on contracted capacity levels;
• The financing cost component of toll charge revenue set at A$7.00 per ton (split as approximately 80% U.S. dollar
and approximately 20% Australian dollar per ton), compared with the current contractual finance cap of
approximately A$10;
• Operations and maintenance costs in line with management's forecasts;
• Future refinance margins of 250 basis points over base rates;
• Consumer Price Index at 2.5%; and
• LIBOR in accordance with S&P Global Ratings' forward curve.

Key Metrics
Senior debt:
• Minimum DSCR of 1.85x in December 2024; and
• Average DSCR of 2.07x until the maturity of the senior debt in 2038.
Junior debt:
• Minimum DSCR of 1.28x in December 2024; and
• Average DSCR of 1.88x until the maturity of the junior debt in 2043.
The total actual DSCR will always be about 1x because NCIG's toll charges are designed to cover annually all
operating and financing costs with no profit margin. In order to calculate market relevant DSCRs, our base-case cash
flow considers revenues at our maximum forecast finance charge, which we currently assume to be A$7 per ton. This
finance charge is sized having regard to estimated shipper profit margins at the lower end of the pricing cycle.

S&P Global Ratings Downside Case
Assumptions
• Revenues decreased by 15% and revenue losses not socialized;
• Operations, maintenance, and lifecycle cost pass-through maintained;
• Refinancing margin increased to 400 basis points;

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 24, 2019 6

Newcastle Coal Infrastructure Group Pty Ltd.

• LIBOR increased to 600 basis points; and
• Inflation of 1.5%.

Key Metrics
Senior debt
• Minimum DSCR of 1.12x in December 2024; and
• Average DSCR of 1.24x until the maturity of the senior debt in 2038.
Junior debt
• Minimum DSCR of 0.85x in December 2024, with the ratio falling below 1.0x in 2019, (i.e. unpaid interest on the
junior debt will capitalize while senior debt is outstanding); and
• Average DSCR of 1.42x until the maturity of the junior debt in 2043.
The results of our downside scenario do not affect our base-case assessment for the senior debt.
The results of our downside scenario provide an insight into the default risk of the junior debt. As a result of junior
ratios remaining below 1.0x for more than three years under our downside scenario, our downside assessment for the
junior debt is 'b+', which caps the rating on the junior debt.

Operations phase SACP
The operations phase stand-alone credit profile (SACP), excluding any adjustments related to the structure of the
transaction, drives the issue rating on NCIG's senior debt, given that the project is fully operational and has no
construction risk. The issue rating reflects the following factors:
• We consider the operations and maintenance task to be relatively simple and straightforward. NCIG also benefits
from strong ship-or-pay contracts, which further limit operational risk because shippers are required to pay even if
no coal is shipped.
• We assume a certain level of market risk, which we assess to be low, despite the contractual framework and existing
ship-or-pay contracts insulating the project from most volume fluctuations. We consider demand for coal export
port capacity out of Newcastle to likely continue, given our forecast of coal production in the Hunter Valley and
long-term demand for Hunter Valley coal. We believe NCIG's ability to pass through increased costs to shippers is
limited in extended periods of low coal prices. Given the amortization structure within NCIG's bank debt and NCIG's
approach to partial amortization of capital market debt, we make no adjustments for its debt structure, noting that
no covenants exist that mandate the amortization profile of the capital markets debt. If NCIG were to reduce the
rate of amortization to cut shippers' overall costs, we could then lower the ratings if we assessed that the overall
debt structure had weakened.
• The operations phase SACP for the senior debt incorporates a negative one-notch adjustment, reflecting subdued
longer-term prospects of the coal mining sector globally and the fact that further deterioration could lead us to
reassess our market-related assumptions.
• The operations phase SACP for the junior debt incorporates an effective negative two-notch adjustment, reflecting
weak coverages under our downside stress scenario. There is no junior debt reserve and the ratios fall below 1x
under our stress scenario.

Operations counterparties
Counterparty
• We assign a counterparty dependency assessment (CDA) to counterparties that we consider to be not easily
replaceable without significant time or cash-flow implications. This CDA could then constrain our project finance
issue rating. Currently, no such constraint exists for NCIG.

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 24, 2019 9

Newcastle Coal Infrastructure Group Pty Ltd.

Revenue counterparty
• We consider the existing shippers as replaceable, and therefore, do not assign a CDA. Supporting this view is the
occasional trading of capacity between existing users. Furthermore, the socialization of revenue across users, which
is embedded in the ship-or-pay contracts, acts, in practice, as a de-facto replacement should a user default on its
contract.

Operations and maintenance (O&M) counterparty
• NCIG performs the O&M services.

Financial counterparties
• NCIG has bank accounts with the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ). In addition, it has interest
rate and cross currency swaps with ANZ, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), Sumitomo Mitsui Banking
Group, National Australia Bank Ltd., Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. Ltd., Industrial and Commercial Bank of China
Ltd., United Overseas Bank Ltd., and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. Letters of credit (LoC) provided by
financial institutions rated at least 'A' back shippers' obligations under the ship-or-pay contracts and shippers'
obligations to fund the senior debt service reserve account.
• The ratings on these institutions are comfortably above the project ratings and do not currently constrain the issue
ratings.

Liquidity
• We assess NCIG's liquidity as neutral. NCIG can pass on uncapped operating costs to the shippers, and finance
costs up to a cap. In addition, NCIG has a US$85 million debt service reserve that is sized to cover six months of
senior debt service.
• In the event that any shipper did not meet its payment commitments, NCIG has access to liquid security equivalent
to 12 months' revenue.
• We expect NCIG to continue to actively manage its debt maturities well ahead of time. Following the recent
refinancing, the senior debt maturities of US$135 million in December 2019 and US$25 million in November 2020
are earmarked for repayment, and the bank facility due in March 2021 was repaid in June 2019.
