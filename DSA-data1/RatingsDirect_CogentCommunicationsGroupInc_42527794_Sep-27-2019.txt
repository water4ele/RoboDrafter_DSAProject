Key Strengths

Key Risks

Low-priced Internet service provider (ISP) for
business customers.

Intense competition from larger players, including incumbent telecom and cable companies,
as well as other facility-based providers.

Diversified geographic and customer bases.

Shorter contract lengths than those of most of its competitors, which can lead to higher
customer churn.

Lower exposure to declining legacy revenue than
that of its peers.

Adjusted debt to EBITDA is expected to remain elevated in the high-4x area in 2019.
We expect that the company will return excess cash flow to shareholders in the form of
dividends and stock buybacks.

Limited exposure to legacy networking services shields Cogent from secular industry pressures.Cogent provides
high-speed Internet service to small and mid-size businesses (SMBs) and communications companies. Rising market
demand for bandwidth and enterprise IT outsourcing to data centers, as well as cloud-based networking, drive
Cogent's business growth. Unlike many of its peers, Cogent has limited exposure to legacy services, which are subject
to technological substitution and pricing pressure. Furthermore, its strategy is unique in that its focus is on
connectivity rather than premium telecom services to business customers.
Cogent faces intense competition, especially in the Netcentric business, which is subject to pricing pressure. The
company's Netcentric segment consists of carrier, Internet service, and content providers such as Netflix. In this
business segment, Cogent faces intense competition from both international and regional players, including
CenturyLink, Telia, NTT, AT&T, Verizon, Tata, Telefonica, and Orange. In addition, Netcentric customers have
significant scale and are able to negotiate favorable pricing with Cogent. As a result, pricing per Mbps is declining by
about 20% per year, which hurts overall revenue growth trends despite healthy unit growth.
Cogent's recent €135 million note issuance underscores its aggressive financial policy. Cogent has an aggressive
financial policy that includes a common dividend and periodic share repurchases. In June 2019, the company issued
€135 million of new senior notes to fund the repurchase of common stock. The new issuance pushed leverage above
5x from about 4.4x. Despite our expectation for higher levels of EBITDA and margin improvement because of
connection growth and high operating leverage, we believe that Cogent will continue to allocate excess cash flow to
shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, such that leverage remains elevated over the longer term

Cogent Communications Group Inc.

in the high-4x-5x area.
Chart 1

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our expectation for mid-single-digit-percentage revenue growth and margins in the
low-to-mid-30% area, such that adjusted debt to EBITDA is in the mid-to-high-4x area over the next year.

Downside scenario
Although we believe a downgrade is unlikely, we could lower the rating if Cogent's customer churn rises sharply
because of competitive pressures or an economic downturn, leading to negative free operating cash flow (FOCF)
or leverage rising above 5.25x on a sustained basis. We could also lower the rating if the company made a
debt-financed acquisition or recapitalization that increased leverage to 5.25x, with limited near-term prospects for
improvement.

Upside scenario
We could raise the rating if Cogent reduced leverage to below 4x and management articulated a financial policy
consistent with sustained lower leverage, which we view as unlikely. We could also raise the rating with a positive
reassessment of the company's business risk as a result of consistently lower churn, less pricing pressure, or a
pronounced shift toward longer-term customer contracts.

Our Base-Case Scenario
Mid-single-digit organic revenue growth over the next couple of years. Demand continues to be driven by mobile data
and video consumption, enterprise IT outsourcing to data centers and the cloud, wireless backhaul, carrier network
densification via small cells, migration of media content to over-the-top platforms, and connected devices. These
industry tailwinds are partly offset by pricing pressure for Internet protocol (IP) transit.
Assumptions

• U.S. GDP growth of 2.5% in 2019 and 1.8% in 2020;
however, the telecom sector is generally less
susceptible to adverse macroeconomic conditions.
Instead, we believe these companies are more
affected by industry trends, which include favorable
demand characteristics in the fiber- transport
industry.

• Overall revenue growth in the
mid-single-digit-percentage area in 2019 and 2020,
primarily due to new customer connections and
increased demand for high-bandwidth Internet
access.
• On-net revenue increases of about 6%-8% due to
customer connection growth of around 10%-12%,
partly offset by average revenue per user (ARPU)
declines of about 4%-6% in 2019 and 2020.
• Off-net revenue increases of about 2%-4% due to
connection growth of 8%-10%, partly offset by
ARPU declines of about 6%-8% in 2019 and 2020.
• EBITDA margins improve modestly in 2019 and
2020, but remain in the low-to-mid-30% area due to
revenue growth and greater operating leverage.
• We believe the company will use its cash balances
and free cash flow for shareholder returns.

Company Description
Cogent Communications Group Inc. provides high-speed Internet service to SMB and communications companies in
North America, Europe, and Asia. The company divides its business into two customer segments: net-centric
customers (including other ISPs, telecom and cable companies, web-content companies, and universities) and SMB
customers in multi-tenant office buildings. As of June 30, 2019, Cogent had over 47,650 corporate and more than
36,400 net-centric customer connections on its network. The company was founded in 1999 and is headquartered in

Business Risk: Weak
Our business risk assessment reflects intense competition from multiple industry players and short contract lengths,
which can lead to higher customer churn. Intense price competition and elevated churn are hallmarks of the
net-centric segment. Competition is also high in the corporate segment, mainly from incumbent telecom providers;
however, customers' increased bandwidth usage typically offsets deflationary pricing pressures. We expect
competitive trends in both segments to continue, if not intensify, because competitors have been expanding their fiber
networks. Cogent's competition is formidable and includes large incumbent telecommunications companies as well as
national bandwidth providers and smaller players focusing on metro markets. Nevertheless, Cogent typically offers
lower-price services than those of its competitors or provides greater bandwidth for the same price, partly because of
its lower-cost, data-specific IP-based network while incumbents are still using voice-based networks.
Cogent's customer and end-market diversity is more solid than that of its peers, with the top 25 customers accounting
for less than 6% of revenues, though Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google (FAANG) customers still account

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 24, 2019 5

Cogent Communications Group Inc.

for an increasing share of the net-centric business. Notwithstanding its customer diversity, the potential for higher
churn is a significant risk. Cogent's typical contract length of two to three years is much shorter than that of many of its
peers, and a substantial portion of its customers obtain service on a month-to-month basis. However, the company has
been emphasizing longer contracts in recent years, which has helped it maintain low unit churn of about 1% and is
positive for credit quality.

be less than 10% in 2019. Although Cogent has a shareholder-friendly financial policy under which it pays dividends
and repurchases stock, the company has set a net leverage target of 2.5x-3.5x (not S&P Global Ratings-adjusted). We
believe that even if Cogent engages in debt-financed shareholder returns, it will remain within its stated target, which
translates to our lease-adjusted leverage ratio of about 4x-5x.

Liquidity: Adequate
We view Cogent's liquidity as adequate, reflecting our expectation that sources of liquidity will exceed uses by over 2x
over the next 12 months and that net sources will remain positive, even with a 15% decline in forecasted EBITDA.
Although Cogent has a sizeable cash balance of over $400 million, we expect it will return much of this cash to
shareholders over the next year. In addition, the company does not have a revolving credit facility, which reduces its

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 24, 2019 7

Cogent Communications Group Inc.

ability to absorb adverse events if cash becomes depleted.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Cash and cash equivalent of about $409 million as of
June 30, 2019; and

• Capital expenditures of about $50 million-$60
million in next 12 months;

• Our expectations of fund from operations of $140
million-$160 million over the next 12 months.

• A common dividend of about $110 million in 2019;
and
• Share repurchases or a one-time dividend to
stockholders of about $115 million-$120 million over
the next 12 months.

Issue Ratings - Recovery Analysis
Key analytical factors
• Under our simulated default scenario we envision increased competition from broadband and transport providers,
causing industry prices to fall precipitously despite volume growth, which results in lower profit margins that
ultimately strain the company's liquidity to the point of payment default.
• We have valued the company as a going concern using a 5.5x multiple of our projected emergence EBITDA.
• Generally, we assign a multiple of 5x-6x for our fiber infrastructure companies. We chose a 5.5x multiple to reflect
the company's ownership of a majority of its fiber under long-term indefeasible rights-of-use agreements, which we
view more favorably than short-term leases. However, the company is primarily a long-haul provider, which we
view less favorably than metro-fiber providers.

Simulated default assumptions
• Simulated year of default: 2023
• EBITDA at emergence: $52 million
• EBITDA multiple: 5.5x

• Net enterprise value (after 5% administrative costs): $273 million
• Valuation split % (obligors/non-obligors): 77%/23%

• --Recovery expectations: 50%-70%: rounded estimate: 55%
