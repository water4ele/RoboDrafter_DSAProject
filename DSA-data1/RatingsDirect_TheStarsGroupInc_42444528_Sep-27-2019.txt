A market leader in the online poker industry that supports high adjusted EBITDA margins. The Stars Group Inc. (TSGI)
enjoys a market-leading position in the online poker industry (about 70% market share) because of the player liquidity
of its network, customer service and breadth of games, which are important factors for attracting and retaining players.
S&P Global Ratings expects the company's increasing exposure to online casino and sports betting should support
TSGI's EBITDA growth. In our view, the company's ability to cross-sell online casino and sports betting to existing
poker customers and entry into new jurisdictions, along with scalable technology platform, will support TSGI's high
adjusted EBITDA margins of about 34%-36% over the next 12-24 months.
Online sports betting exposes the company to cash flow volatility. TSGI's acquisition of Sky Betting & Gaming (SkyBet)
has increased the company's exposure to higher growth online sports betting (from about 19% of revenue in
second-quarter 2018 to about 36% of revenue in second-quarter 2019); however, online sports betting has inherent
cash flow volatility compared to online poker (for example, unfavorable sporting outcomes could affect the company's
topline growth). As a result, the company's strong EBITDA growth expectations are somewhat offset by the underlying
cash flow volatility from the online sports betting industry. Furthermore, the company's earnings are subject to risk of
foreign exchange fluctuations and discretionary spending and macro-economic cycles, which could affect consumer
preferences toward gambling.
TSGI's improving credit measures are supported by robust FOCF generation.We expect the company to generate
robust FOCF of about US$300 million-US$350 million annually over the next two years, spurred by TSGI's strong
brand in the online poker market, increasing product diversity, the asset-light nature of the business, and the
company's entry into new jurisdictions. In our view, we anticipate the company to use its free cash flow for debt
repayment ahead of any material shareholder remuneration or acquisition, thereby leading to improving credit
measures. Furthermore, the company's organic EBITDA growth (in the low-to-mid single-digit area), should further

support TSGI's deleveraging trend.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our view that TSGI's market-leading position in the online poker market and organic
growth from the company's online sports betting segment should support EBITDA growth over the next 12
months. We expect the company to generate robust FOCF, which it intends to use for debt reduction, along with
EBITDA growth that should support its deleveraging strategy, with adjusted debt-to-EBITDA to be about 5.5x-6.0x
over the next 12 months.

Upside scenario
We could raise the rating over the next 12 months if adjusted debt-to-EBITDA falls below 5x and adjusted
FOCF-to-debt improves and is sustained above 7.5%. This could result from stronger organic EBITDA growth
reflecting better performance from SkyBet and better-than-expected FOCF generation and debt repayment. At the
same time, we would expect TSGI to commit to stronger credit measures when taking debt-financed acquisitions
or material shareholder remuneration into consideration, for it to be commensurate with a higher rating.

Downside scenario
We could lower the ratings in the next 12 months if the company's adjusted debt-to-EBITDA remains above 6.5x
and adjusted FOCF-to-debt approaches 3% because of weaker earnings and reduced FOCF generation. Such a
scenario could arise if competition intensifies in the online sports betting segment and TSGI is unable to cross-sell
to its online poker customers, thereby leading to lower EBITDA generation, and affecting the company's
deleveraging strategy. Alternatively, we could lower the rating on TSGI if management's policy shifts away from
debt repayment or if the litigation charge imposed is meaningfully higher than expected, concurrent with a large
debt-funded acquisition or shareholder remuneration, which could lead to higher leverage of adjusted
debt-to-EBITDA to be above 6.5x.

is lower than the historical level of 43% in fiscal
2017, reflecting increasing exposure to the online

Base-case projections
Profitability to improve over the next 12-24 months. We expect the company to fully realize about US$100 million of
cost synergies from its SkyBet acquisition by fiscal year-end 2020. In addition, TSGI's organic EBITDA growth from
the company's respective product segments (poker, online casino, and sports betting) along with cross-selling, should
support EBITDA growth. Based on these factors, we expect the company's adjusted EBITDA margins to improve to
34%-36% from about 33% in 2018.
Improving credit measures increases TSGI's balance-sheet capacity to absorb cash flow volatility. TSGI's earnings are
subject to changes in discretionary spending, macro-economic cycles, foreign exchange fluctuations, and volatility
from online sports betting segment. As a result, the company is exposed to higher level of cash flow volatility than
previously, which could make it vulnerable because of its high balance-sheet debt. The company's ability to reduce
debt from internally generated cash flows and organic EBITDA growth leads to improvement in credit measures;
nevertheless, the underlying cash flow volatility could delay TSGI's deleveraging trend as witnessed by the company's
recent quarterly performance (TSGI's full-year 2019 EBITDA guidance has reduced the company's pace of
deleveraging by about 0.4x-0.5x, keeping adjusted debt-to-EBITDA just above 5.0x in 2020).

Company Description
TSGI is an Ontario-based online gaming company with product offerings focused on online poker, online sports
betting, and online casino gaming.

Business Risk: Fair
Our business risk profile on TSGI reflects our view of the company's strong share of the mature online poker market,
which is highly discretionary and cyclical in nature; enhanced product diversity; and robust profitability.
The SkyBet acquisition in 2018 has improved TSGI's product diversity and scale, which we view to be credit positive
factors. In our opinion, SkyBet enhances the company's product diversity with lower exposure to poker (about 30% of
revenues in second-quarter 2019). We view its entry into online sports betting (about 36% of revenues in
second-quarter 2019) to be credit positive, as it is a high growth market (expected to increase in the high single digits)
compared to the saturated online poker market (expected to expand in the low single digits). The acquisition also
improves the company's exposure to regulated markets, with almost 75% of its revenues derived from regulated
jurisdictions compared with about 50% (prior the SkyBet acquisition). We believe that regulated markets offer revenue
sustainability compared to unregulated markets, due to increased transparency in operations. SkyBet has materially
increased the company's scale in terms of revenues (about US$2.5 billion on a pro forma basis) and EBITDA (about
US$900 million on a pro forma basis from about US$660 million), thus positioning TSGI to be one of the largest online
gaming company in the world.
SkyBet operates in the highly competitive online sports betting market in the U.K., which is growing organically in the
high double-digit area. SkyBet's double-digit organic growth is driven by the company's increasing penetration through
a mobile product offering and strong relationship with former parent Sky plc. The company generates over 80% of its
revenues from the mobile platform, which is the fastest-growing medium in the online gaming market and provides the
company with a first mover advantage in that market. We believe SkyBet's relationship with Sky plc (one of the largest

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 12, 2019 7

The Stars Group Inc.

media companies in the U.K.) is a competitive advantage because it acts as a source of new customers and aids in
customer retention, which supports the company's cash flow growth. SkyBet retains exclusive rights (21 years are
remaining under its licensing agreement) to the Sky brand in any jurisdiction where its former parent operates. As a
result of Sky Plc's acquisition of Sky Deutschland and Sky Italia in 2015, we expect SkyBet to make measured moves
to establish and expand operations in Germany and Italy, taking advantage of growing brand awareness. Therefore, we
view the relationship as a means to both defend its market position in the U.K. and establish positions in new overseas
markets.
Nevertheless, we believe the high concentration (40% of second-quarter 2019 revenue) and increasing regulatory risks
in the U.K. could pressure SkyBet's earnings. Even though we do not expect the U.K. government's October 2017
Triennial Review on gaming machines to have a direct effect on the online gaming segment, we remain cautious about
regulatory changes in terms of further tax increases that could have negative earnings implication. SkyBet generates
about 55%-60% of its revenues from online sports betting, which we view to be a more volatile segment in the online
gaming industry driven by higher probability of lower bet win margin. As a result , we expect TSGI to experience more
earnings volatility.
We anticipate TSGI to remain exposed to changes in consumer preferences for poker and online gaming, which are
highly discretionary and cyclical in nature, along with fluctuations of local currencies against the U.S. dollar. We
believe the company to have lower adjusted EBITDA margins of about 34%-36% in 2019 and 2020 compared with
TSGI stand-alone adjusted EBITDA margins of about 43% in 2017. We believe dilution in profitability is the result of
increasing exposure to the online sports betting and online casino market (while online poker has higher profitability),
which has lower margins, increased marketing expenditures to support its growth in new and existing markets, and
increased gaming duties associated with the new and existing jurisdictions.

Peer comparison
Our higher issuer credit rating on GVC Holdings plc (BB/Positive/--) reflects the company's larger revenue scale (EUR
3.7 billion) and omni channel presence (50% online and 40% land-based terminals) as well as the fact that 75% of the
company's revenues are derived from the U.K., Germany, and Italy, which are the biggest gaming markets in Europe;
and GVC's lower adjusted debt-to-EBITDA expectation of about 4x over the next 12 months.
William Hill plc (BB/Stable/--) is also rated higher than TSGI, reflecting its increasing presence in the high-growth U.S.
online sports betting market along with lower leverage expectation of adjusted debt-to-EBITDA of 3x-4x. Nevertheless,
these positives are partially offset by the company's slightly smaller revenue and EBITDA scale, moderate online
presence (about 50% of EBITDA), and high exposure to the U.K.'s fixed odds betting terminals (about 50% of EBITDA)
with potential impacts from the triennial review to limit wagering to GBP (Great British Pound) 2.

Financial Risk: Highly leveraged
Our financial risk assessment on TSGI reflects our view that the company's adjusted debt-to-EBITDA will be about
5x-6x and FOCF-to debt about 5%-10% over the next 12-24 months. We expect the company to generate robust
EBITDA and FOCF spurred by its market-leading position in the online poker market, its ability to cross-sell products
to existing poker customers, its strong growth momentum from SkyBet, and the asset-light nature of the business.
TSGI benefits from its online platform operations, which have generally lower capital expenditure requirements and
are scalable, thus converting about 80%-85% of its EBITDA into cash flow for debt service. As a result, we expect
management to use its FOCF to pay down debt along with EBITDA growth, leading to adjusted debt-to-EBITDA to be
about 5.5x by year-end 2020. In our view, the company's improving credit measures provide further support to absorb
the underlying cash flow volatility.

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 12, 2019 9

The Stars Group Inc.

TSGI predominantly treats its development costs as operating expenses, resulting in negligible capital expenditures
compared to land-based casino gaming operators and good prospects for free cash flow generation. Our adjusted debt
calculation also includes about US$200 million of litigation liability, which the company has been contesting in the
court.

Liquidity: Adequate
We consider TSGI's liquidity to be adequate, based on a sources-to-uses ratio above 2x in the next 12 months, which
remains positive in the unlikely event that EBITDA were to decline by 15%. Our liquidity assessment also factors in the
following qualitative factors: the company has sound relationships with its banks; has the ability to absorb high-impact,
low-probability events with limited need for refinancing; and has generally prudent risk management associated with

adequate liquidity.
Principal Liquidity Sources

• Cash and cash equivalents of about US$339 million
as of second-quarter 2019

• Forecast capital expenditure of approximately
US$150 million for the next 12 months

• Availability of about US$626 million under the
US$700 million revolving credit facility maturing in
2023 as of second-quarter 2019

• Working capital cash outflow of about US$50 million

• Funds from operations of about US$500

Debt maturities
• About US$35 million annually from fiscal years 2019-2024
• About US$4.7 billion thereafter

Covenant Analysis
The company has a springing covenant of first-lien net leverage below 6.75x on the revolving credit facility (RCF),
which gets activated when more than 35% drawn. In our base-case scenario, we assume that the RCF is not drawn by
the company, reflecting its robust FOCF generation.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

Social risks are high for gaming companies such as TSGI and in line with its peers. In our opinion, social concerns
pertaining to gambling addiction, money laundering, and increasing anti-social behavior are highlighted by
regulators and the public. As a result, various jurisdictions in Europe have enacted stringent measures to curb
excessive online gambling, which could have potential effects on the company's operational and financial
performance. For example, in the U.K. the remote gaming tax has been increased to 21% from 15%, which could
have a mild impact on TSGI's revenue and EBITDA generation. Similarly, a TV advertising ban in Italy could
further hinder the company's penetration into the market, leading TSGI to adopt other advertising mediums that
could increase marketing and promotional expenses, affecting EBITDA margins.
TSGI refrains from TV advertising for soccer matches in the U.K., which is a step toward self-regulation adopted by
the industry, but this could reduce player activity and thus lead to lower-than-anticipated EBITDA growth from its
U.K. sports betting product offering. However, we view this action as supporting the long-term sustainability of
both the company and the industry, thereby reducing higher regulatory risks; nevertheless, at the same time it
could impact the company's financial performance and debt repaying capacity.

Issue Ratings - Recovery Analysis
Key analytical factors
• Our simulated default scenario incorporates the assumption that TSGI will default in 2023, reflecting intense
competition that will lead to market share erosion.
• We assume that the company would be reorganized or sold as a going concern as opposed to being liquidated
because the company would likely retain greater value as an ongoing entity in the event of default.
• We believe that if the company were to default, there would remain a viable business model, driven by TSGI's
strong brand recognition in the online gaming industry and entry into newer jurisdictions.
• Our recovery analysis yields a net default enterprise value of about US$3.4 billion, based on a 7x multiple of US$512
million of emergence EBITDA estimate and 5% administrative expenses.
• The higher EBITDA multiple of 7.0x as opposed to the sector multiple of 6.5x reflects the enhanced scale and
diversity, which puts the company almost in line with other similarly rated peers.
• Our analysis also assumes that the senior secured creditors are secured by 80% of the company's default enterprise
value because TSGI operates in a number of jurisdictions around the world that are not part of the obligor group.
• Due to this, the senior secured claims have a '3' recovery rating, indicating our expectation for meaningful
(50%-70%; rounded estimate: 65%) recovery in the event of a default, leading to an issue-level rating of 'B+'.
• After servicing the senior secured claims, there would be about US$239 million of remaining value (including
non-obligor value) available to be distributed to the senior unsecured claims. Therefore, the senior unsecured claims
have a '6' recovery rating, indicating our expectation of negligible (0%-10%; rounded estimate: 5%) recovery in the
event of default, and an issue-level rating of 'B-'.
