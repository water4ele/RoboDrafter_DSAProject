Overview
Key strengths

Key risks

High proportion of crude oil and natural gas liquids (NGLs) in the company's
reserves and production mix, which we view favorably relative to natural gas due to
our commodity price expectations.

Participation in the volatile and capital-intensive oil and gas
exploration and production (E&P) industry.

Large acreage position in the liquids-rich Permian Basin that supports production
and reserve growth.

Concentration of reserves in a single basin.

Strong credit metrics, with funds from operations (FFO) to debt expected to remain
well in excess of 100% under our production, cost, and price assumptions.

Smaller reserve and production base relative to 'BBB' rated
peers.

Positive free cash flow, despite high capital spending.

Increased focus on shareholder returns might signal a shift
in management’s historically conservative financial policy.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on Pioneer Natural Resources Co. reflects S&P Global Ratings' view that the company will
continue to expand production and reserves through drilling its Permian acreage, while maintaining funds from
operation (FFO) to debt well above 60% and debt to EBITDA well below 1x over the next three years. Under our
price assumptions, we forecast Pioneer to post double-digit annual production growth over the next three years.
We also expect the company to generate positive free cash flow, despite annual capital spending of about $3
billion.

Downside scenario
We could lower the issuer credit rating if Pioneer's FFO to debt approaches 45% without a clear path to
improvement. This could occur if the company makes a significant debt-financed acquisition that doesn't add to
near-term cash flow, or if commodity prices fall below our price deck assumptions and the company doesn't rein in
its capital spending.

Upside scenario
We could consider an upgrade if the company increases its reserves and production base to levels more in line
with that of its higher rated peers or broadens its geographic diversity, while maintaining solid credit measures.

Assumptions

• S&P Global Ratings' price assumptions for West
Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil of $55 per barrel
(bbl) for the remainder of 2019 and thereafter;
• Our price assumptions for Henry Hub natural gas of
$2.25 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) for
the remainder of 2019, $2.50/mmBtu in 2020,
$2.75/mmBtu in 2021, and $3.00/mmBtu thereafter;
• We assume Pioneer's natural gas liquids (NGLs)
price at around 45% of WTI in 2019 and thereafter;
• We assume negative differentials of $2.00 per barrel
for oil compared to WTI and 65 cents per mmBtu
for natural gas relative to Henry Hub. Pioneer
benefits from firm transportation contracts out of the
Permian basin for most of its production;

• Daily production of about 328,000 barrels of oil

• Oil and NGLs will account for about 84% of
Pioneer's production in 2019 and thereafter; and
• Capital spending of roughly $3.2 billion in 2019 and
$3.3 billion in 2020.

Base-case projections
We model $750 million of share buybacks in 2019 and $300 million in 2020. This represents about $1.2 billion of share
buybacks under the current $2 billion program. We believe this amount is appropriate under our current price
assumptions, but that the company could dial up or down depending on market conditions or changes in financial
policy.
We do not incorporate potential asset sales or acquisitions in our projections.

Company Description
Pioneer Natural Resources is a midsize U.S.-based independent oil and gas E&P company, with all of its assets located
in the Permian Basin of West Texas. At year-end 2018, the company had 1,049 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) of
proved reserves, 77% of which constituted oil and liquids, and 92% of which were classified as proved developed.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
Pioneer's business risk profile reflects its participation in the cyclical oil and gas exploration and production (E&P)
industry, its midsize proved reserve base, solid production growth profile, and concentration in the oil-rich Permian
Basin. As of Dec. 31, 2018, Pioneer had a proved reserve base of 1,049 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe),
comprised of 77% oil and NGLs and about 92% proved developed reserves. Pioneer had daily production of about
320,000 boe/d (approximately 79% oil and NGLs) for the year ended 2018. Both metrics place Pioneer at the lower
end of the peer group of 'BBB' rated U.S. independent E&P companies. However, we expect Pioneer to continue to
post annual reserve and production growth rates in the mid- to high-teens under our current commodity price
assumptions. In addition, Pioneer has a relatively long 11-year reserve life compared with U.S. shale peers, which
provides some flexibility to adjust spending levels should crude oil prices weaken.
Pioneer's reserves are concentrated in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp formations in the Permian Basin of West Texas (88%
of proved reserves as of year-end 2018). The company has a deep drilling inventory in this prolific basin that provides
production growth visibility for the next 10 years, even at current spending levels. Pioneer holds more than 760,000
gross acres in the Midland Basin (one of the two main producing areas of the Permian Basin along the Delaware
Basin). Due to the high rates of returns in this basin in the current commodity price environment, Pioneer will
accelerate its Permian development plan and run on average 21 to 23 rigs there in 2019. We expect total capital
spending to increase to $3.2 billion in 2019 and oil production to increase by 10% to 15% annually over the next three
years. As Pioneer continues to allocate most of its capital to drilling the Wolfcamp/Spraberry formations, we expect
crude oil and NGLs to constitute 80% to 85% of total production in 2019 and 2020 (up from about 70% in 2015).
Nevertheless, the geographic concentration of Pioneer's reserve base in the Permian Basin results in heightened
exposure to potentially wide negative price differentials, throughput constraints, and other negative operational and

regulatory factors that could be mitigated by having additional assets outside the region. To reduce its exposure to
basin differentials and takeaway constraints, the company has entered into firm pipeline commitments to deliver the
majority of its oil production to Gulf Coast refineries and export markets, and most of of its gas production to the
Southern California market or the Gulf Coast.
We view the company's operating cost structure as competitive with that of its peer group in the Permian. The
company's cash costs (lease operating, production taxes, and cash general and administrative expenses) were in line
with its peer average at about $12.30 per boe in 2018. We expect costs to decrease as Pioneer is currently
implementing a cost savings program intended to cut general and administrative (G&A) costs by $100 million annually.
Pioneer's profitability should be supported by economies of scale as the company continues to grow.

All 'BBB' rated U.S.-based E&P peers boast a larger reserve base and a higher degree of asset diversification relative to
Pioneer. However, the company benefits from greater oil content in reserves, higher percentage of proved developed
reserves, and stronger credit metrics.

Financial Risk: Modest
Our assessment of Pioneer's financial risk reflects our expectation that credit metrics will remain strong over the next
three years. We expect the company's credit measures to remain appropriate for the current rating with FFO to debt
above 100% and debt to EBITDA below 1.0x through 2021. Although the company has historically outspent its cash
flows to fund its growth objectives, it has issued equity and sold noncore assets to fund the deficit. Moreover, we
expect free cash flow before returns to shareholders to be positive in 2019 and 2020 based on our current commodity
prices and capital spending assumptions. Under our production, price, and cost assumptions, the company will
generate FFO of about $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion in 2019 and 2020, and will have annual capital spending of $3.2
billion to $3.3 billion. We expect cash flow generation to be susceptible to changes in commodity prices though, as
only 30% to 35% of expected oil production for the remainder of 2019 and 2020 is hedged. We believe Pioneer will
maintain these conservative financial policies, despite an increased focus on shareholder returns. We forecast the
company to distribute about $250 million of dividends annually, up from $55 million in 2018, and to make sizable share
buy backs in 2019 and 2020 under our production and price assumptions.

Liquidity: Strong
We assess Pioneer's liquidity as strong. We expect the company's liquidity sources will cover uses by at least 1.5x for
the next 12 to 18 months and that sources would exceed uses even if our projected EBITDA declined by 30%. The
company has a solid relationship with banks, a generally high standing in the credit markets, and prudent risk
management policies.

Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Cash and short-term investments of approximately
$643 million as of June 30, 2019;

• We assume capital spending of $3.2 to $3.3 billion
annually; and

• Full availability under its $1.5 billion revolving credit
facility due 2023; and

• Debt maturity of $450 million in January 2020.

• FFO of about $3.3 billion in 2019 and $3.6 billion in
2020.

Debt maturities
As of June 30, 2019:
• 2020: $450 million
• 2021: $500 million
• 2022: $600 million
• 2026-2028: $750 million

Covenant Analysis
Pioneer's revolving credit facility requires the maintenance of a total debt to book capitalization ratio, subject to certain
adjustments, of no more than 0.65 to 1.0. We expect the company to comfortably meet this requirement over the next
couple of years.

Other Credit Considerations
We apply a downward adjustment of one notch for comparable rating analysis due to Pioneer's smaller size and scale
relative to its 'BBB+' rated peers.

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

AUGUST 21, 2019 9

Pioneer Natural Resources Co.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

We view Pioneer's exposure to environmental and social risks as moderate given its operations in Texas, a state
that generally has a supportive political climate for E&P companies. The financial impact, however, of a localized
environmental incident, tighter regulation, or community opposition to drilling or fracking could hinder Pioneer's
ability to develop and replace reserves given its asset concentration. We note that the company has shut down its
sand mining operations and sold its hydraulic fracturing business, and that we do not expect ongoing litigation in
connection to silica-related health issues arising from these historical operations to have a material impact on the
company. Finally, Pioneer has a good safety track record and no history of significant environmental accidents.
We view Pioneer's management and governance as satisfactory, reflecting a sound operational history, which is
instrumental in preventing environmental damage from its wells and infrastructure.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Because Pioneer has low leverage and a modest financial risk profile, we believe the possibility of any lenders being
significantly disadvantaged relative to other lenders is low.

Capital structure
Pioneer's capital structure consists of its $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and about $2.3 billion of senior unsecured
debt at year-end 2018. The credit facility and all senior debt are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment.

Analytical conclusions
Based on the existing debt structure, we rate the senior unsecured notes 'BBB', in line with the issuer credit rating.

S&P keeps certain activities of its business units separate from each other in order to preserve the independence and objectivity of their respective activities. As a result,
certain business units of S&P may have information that is not available to other S&P business units. S&P has established policies and procedures to maintain the
confidentiality of certain non-public information received in connection with each analytical process.
S&P may receive compensation for its ratings and certain analyses, normally from issuers or underwriters of securities or from obligors. S&P reserves the right to disseminate
its opinions and analyses. S&P's public ratings and analyses are made available on its Web sites, www.standardandpoors.com (free of charge), and www.ratingsdirect.com
