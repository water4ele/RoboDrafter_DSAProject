Almost half of ViaSat's revenue comes from the government segment.
Demand from this segment is influenced by unstable geopolitical factors, and contracts can be terminated abruptly if
defense budgets are cut. We also believe demand for certain products, such as radios, can be lumpy and correlated to
wartime spending. However, the risk of contract cancellation is mitigated by good program diversity and participation
in the high-priority communications and cybersecurity areas of defense spending. Furthermore, Viasat has
demonstrated an ability to capture new awards and grow revenue significantly over the past decade, which we expect
will continue.

Viasat is targeting niche addressable markets that have room for growth, including residential
broadband and in-flight connectivity (IFC).
We forecast an addressable market of about 10 million-12 million households in the U.S. that cannot be served by
terrestrial networks in an economically efficient manner due to their rural location. Based on this forecast, we think this
market is roughly 25% penetrated by ViaSat and Hughes, which provides future growth prospects for the company
given the increasing importance of internet in the lives of consumers. Separately, the majority of airlines outside the
U.S. still do not have an in-flight Wi-Fi provider, presenting a significant opportunity for growth for years to come if
Viasat can continue to secure new awards.

Investments in global capacity will result in elevated capital spending for at least the next three
years, requiring access to capital.
We expect capex to increase in fiscal year ending March 31, 2020 to around $750 million-$850 million as construction
on the ViaSat-3 constellation and related investments in ground infrastructure picks up. In addition, customer premise
equipment investments will also likely increase moderately with broadband gross additions. Therefore, we expect a
cumulative cash burn of at least $1 billion through 2022 that will likely need to be funded through external sources
given the company's cash and revolver availability was around $810 million as of June 30, 2019.

The industry could face longer-term oversupply from new satellites.
The current very high throughput satellites (VHTS) in development that both Hughes and ViaSat expect to launch in
2021 will drastically increase the amount of bandwidth available over the Americas. While this will enable faster
internet speeds, enabling opportunities to increase average revenue per user (ARPU), there is the potential for price
compression if subscriber growth does not materialize. Separately, there are several LEO constellations in
development that aim to target the global in-home and in-flight broadband markets. While the LEO business case is
challenged by inherent inefficiencies of stranded capacity over oceans, if one or more of the constellations gains
funding, we believe increased competition could limit earnings growth potential for Viasat longer term.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our expectation that leverage will remain between 3x-4x over the next year as
meaningful earnings growth is offset by higher net debt to fund investments in ViaSat-3. However, we expect
FOCF to remain significantly negative for at least the next two years.

Downside scenario
We could lower the rating if operational performance weakens due to competitive pressures in the satellite services
segment, causing elevated churn and pricing pressure such that leverage rises above 5x.

Upside scenario
Although unlikely over the next year, we could raise the rating if the company generates positive FOCF on a
sustained basis, with leverage below 4x. It would also need to demonstrate the profitable capture of new business
opportunities justifying an adequate return on investment for the ViaSat-3 constellation.

Our Base-Case Scenario

SEPTEMBER 20, 2019 3

Viasat Inc.

Assumptions

• Performance is less susceptible to adverse
macroeconomic conditions and more affected by
secular trends including increasing demand for
bandwidth among residential consumers, airline
passengers, and government agencies.
• Revenue growth of 10%-15% per year over the next
two years driven by an increase in government
revenues, more commercial aircraft entering service,
and higher residential ARPU.

• EBITDA gradually improving to 25% by fiscal year
ending March 31, 2020 and 26% in 2021 from about
21% currently due to higher volumes as the
company's cost base is largely fixed.
• Capex to revenue of around 35% over the next two
years as the company invests in the ViaSat-3
constellation.

Base-case projections
Residential broadband subscriber growth remains soft, but ARPU remains robust.
We believe the satellite anomaly with ViaSat-2 has impaired residential growth. It reduced capacity on the satellite to
260 Gbps compared to its initial estimate of 300 Gbps, resulting in the company focusing more on higher-value plans
and less on volume growth. Therefore, we project only modest subscriber growth of about 2%-3% per year with
pricing rising 3%-5% as customers move up-tier. Overall, we project in-home broadband revenue (which accounts for
the majority of satellite services revenue) to grow by about 5%-7% per year through 2020.

Nonresidential broadband growth continues to accelerate substantially.
The number of planes in service is now 1,335 as of June 30, 2019, up 76% year over year, which supports our forecast
for revenue growth of more than 100% in fiscal 2020. We expect net adds of 375-400 in 2020 based on backlog of 510
planes, which should drive further growth in 2021 of about 50%. New verticals such as community Wi-Fi and
enterprise also continue to grow.

Company Description
ViaSat primarily provides satellite broadband services to residential customers in North America and governments and
enterprises globally, including commercial airlines. The company provides satellite broadband services in North
America through three owned satellites and leases global satellite capacity to provide international services. ViaSat put
its second-generation high-throughput satellite (ViaSat-2) in service in February 2018, and has begun construction on
the ViaSat-3 constellation, including three satellites that will cover the Americas, EMEA, and Asia-Pacific, to be
launched in that order.

Business Risk: Fair
We primarily consider the narrow market for satellite broadband services, the company's limited scale relative to
global satellite service providers, and significant revenue concentration from the U.S. government. These factors are
somewhat offset by our view that ViaSat-2 will support growth over the next few years due to additional capacity and
speed capabilities, notably helping to further scale its IFC business and improve revenue diversity.
We believe the addressable market in the U.S. for residential satellite broadband is limited because around 90% of
homes are served by cable operators, which mostly offer faster data speeds, cheaper service, and higher data caps.
Furthermore, rural demographics that the company targets are unfavorable in the sense that disposable income tends
to be below the national average and many customers place a lower value on the importance of internet. Still, we
believe that broadband adoption in these markets will increase over time and ViaSat will be able to further penetrate
the existing residential broadband satellite market and, to some degree, expand the addressable market by capturing
digital subscriber line (DSL) customers that have slower speeds. ViaSat primarily faces competition from Hughes
Satellite Systems Corp. in the U.S., where Hughes has about two-thirds share of the residential market and ViaSat has
about one-third. Hughes put its high-throughput satellite (Jupiter 2) in service significantly ahead of ViaSat's (in March
2017), although ViaSat-2 offers speeds up to 100 Mbps compared to speeds of 25 Mbps from Jupiter 2.
We believe the additional capacity and speed capabilities of ViaSat-2 will support the company's growth over the next
few years. With a greater percentage (25%-50%) of capacity dedicated to commercial applications on ViaSat-2 than
ViaSat-1 (under 10%), we expect revenue growth from commercial applications will outpace revenue growth from
residential broadband. ViaSat competes globally with Panasonic, Thales, Gogo, Global Eagle and Inmarsat for IFC. We
believe Viasat is well positioned in North America as a vertically integrated provider and will be able compete more
effectively globally once ViaSat-3 satellites are launched over EMEA and Asia, planned for 2021 and 2022,
respectively. However, we also consider that as a later entrant to IFC, with limited global coverage for many years,
and with a shorter track record relative to the competition Viasat may find it difficult to take share from rivals.
ViaSat generates around 26% of revenue from the U.S. government, which despite healthy performance, in our view,
carries the risk of volatility amid potential budgetary constraints and uncertain political trends. However, given current
demand for global mobile broadband and information security, we believe the company can leverage its existing
relationships with various branches of the government to increase government revenue.
Viasat plans to launch its next constellation of ultra high throughput satellites in the coming years, called ViaSat-3.
This constellation will have 8x the capacity of Viasat's current fleet combined, with each satellite expected to offer
over 1 Terabit per second (Tbps). We expect that the ViaSat-3 fleet will accelerate growth in satellite services including
consumer broadband, IFC, and enterprises over the coming years both domestically and internationally. As the
company creates truly global coverage it will be able to expand into new verticals and geographies while also
supplementing existing segments. However, there is still a significant amount of execution risk associated with this
strategy beginning with risk of satellite failure. In order to mitigate this risk, Viasat carries launch insurance should a
satellite fail and it also carries in-orbit insurance on ViaSat-2, ViaSat-1, and WildBlue-1 and intends to seek in-orbit
insurance for the ViaSat-3 fleet.

SEPTEMBER 20, 2019 6

Viasat Inc.

primarily focuses on the residential satellite broadband market in the U.S. where it competes directly with Viasat.
Both companies have recently put new high-throughput satellites over North America with greater data speeds and
caps to support growth. However, the two companies are pursuing different strategies. ViaSat has made a
commitment to expand globally through ViaSat-3, which requires significant capital, leading to negative free
operating cash flow and leverage currently between 3x-4x. Alternatively, Hughes has over $2 billion of cash on its
balance sheet and has committed thus far to build one additional satellite over North America. While it has appetite
for mergers and acquisitions, its stronger financial profile and positive cash generation result in a higher rating than
on ViaSat.
• We view Viasat's business more favorably than that of Gogo and Global Eagle, which compete directly with Viasat
in commercial aviation. Both of these companies lease capacity from other satellite providers and both are highly
leveraged with tight liquidity profiles. Despite declining wholesale rates, we believe limited ability to purchase
additional capacity necessary to compete more effectively presents a challenge for these two companies.
• Speedcast leases satellite capacity to provide mobility solutions. We view the company's business as comparatively
weaker given the company's niche focus as a reseller of capacity in the maritime and energy mobility sectors, where
competition is expected to increase, and the company's customer concentration in the maritime space with Carnival
and Royal Caribbean.
• While we believe ViaSat-3 will improve the company's product offerings and scale, its current size and the
geographic reach of its satellite fleet are much more limited than that of global satellite service providers such as
Intelsat and Inmarsat.

Financial Risk: Aggressive
We expect debt to EBITDA --which was 3.6x for the 12 months ended June 30, 2019--to remain in the 3x-4x range
over the next 2-3 years, as earnings growth of 40%-50% in 2020 and 10%-20% in 2021 and 2022 is offset by increasing
debt to fund capital investments.
While we believe it is prudent to invest in enhanced satellite capability and coverage, it is unclear when cash flow will
turn positive. Under our base case, we project a cash flow deficit of $300 million-$400 million per year over the next
two years as the company funds the ViaSat-3 constellation. However, management plans to invest in ViaSat-4 longer
term, which should have similar or better relative productivity advances as prior generations. The architecture will be
scalable, which would allow VSAT-4 to be compatible with existing ground infrastructure and lower research and
development costs, but the timing and amount of related capex in uncertain. While FOCF will be negative for the
foreseeable future, other credit metrics are relatively strong for the rating, including funds from operations (FFO) to
debt projected around 25% and EBITDA interest coverage projected above 4x.

Liquidity: Adequate
We expect sources of liquidity will exceed uses by about 1.5x over the next 12 months and net sources would remain
positive, even with a 15% decline in forecasted EBITDA. We believe the company has enough liquidity to fund capital
investments over the next year, but that it will require external capital over the next 2-3 years. We believe the
company will have access to capital given its relatively low leverage and healthy growth rates, but it could pull back
significantly on capital spending if necessary.

Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Cash of $129 million as of June 30, 2019.

• Capex of $750 million to $850 million over the next
year.

• Revolver availability of $681 million as of June 30,
2019.
• FFO of $450 million to $500 million over the next 12
months.

• $20 million of required debt repayment over the
next year under the export-import facility due 2025.

Debt maturities
In addition to the $127 million export-import facility, the company has $700 million of notes due 2025 and $600
million due 2027.

Covenant Analysis
Compliance expectations
We believe Viasat will maintain at least a 15% cushion against its covenants over the next year.

Requirements
The company's credit facilities include financial covenants, including a maximum total leverage covenant of 4.75x
(which increases to 5.25x for six quarters following a satellite launch) and a minimum interest coverage covenant of
3.25x.

Issue Ratings - Recovery Analysis
The '1' recovery on Viasat's $600 million 5.625% secured notes due 2027 reflects our expectation for very high
(90%-100%) recovery in a simulated default. The issue-level rating is 'BB+'.
The '6' recovery rating on ViaSat's $700 million 5.625% senior unsecured notes due 2025 indicates our expectation for
negligible (0%-10%; rounded estimate: 5%) recovery for lenders in the event of a payment default. The issue-level
rating is 'B'.
The company's revolving credit facility and export-import credit facility are currently unrated.

Key analytical factors
• Our simulated default scenario contemplates heightened competitive pressures from terrestrial network providers,
satellite operators, and satellite service providers, which leads to increased churn and pricing pressure. This, in
conjunction with high operating costs associated with near-term satellite launches, erodes profitability. This would
cause the company's cash flow to decline to the point that it cannot cover its fixed charges (interest expense,
required amortization, and minimum maintenance capital expenditures), and eventually lead to a default in 2022.
• Other default assumptions include an 85% draw on the revolving credit facility; no future draws on the
export-import facility and required amortization payments of $20 million annually; the spread on the revolving

credit facility rises to 5% as covenant amendments are obtained; and all debt includes six months of prepetition
interest.
• The export-import facility is assumed to have $90 million outstanding at default. This facility is directly
collateralized by ViaSat-2 so the secured notes are subordinated to the export-import facility with respect to the
value of ViaSat-2. In the event that ViaSat-2 is insufficient to meet the export-import claims, then the export-import
facility would share ratable with the unsecured noteholders with respect to the remaining value. We believe
ViaSat-2 value exceeds $90 million and therefore have shown the export-import facility as a priority claim ahead of
the secured notes for simplicity.
• We have valued the company on a going-concern basis using a 6x multiple of our projected emergence EBITDA to
reflect the company's satellite assets and customer relationships, which is in line with that of most other satellite
operators we rate.

Simulated default assumptions
• Default year: 2022
• EBITDA at emergence: $242 million
• EBITDA multiple: 6x

Simplified waterfall
• Gross recovery value: $1.45 billion
• Net recovery value for waterfall after administrative expenses (5%): $1.37 billion
• Obligor/nonobligor valuation split: 100%/0%
• Priority claim on ViaSat-2: $90 million
• Value available for senior secured debt: $1.28 billion
• Estimated senior secured debt: $1.24 billion
• --Recovery expectations: 90%-100% (rounded estimate: 95%)
• Value available for senior unsecured: $40 million
• Estimated senior unsecured debt: $720 million
• --Recovery expectations: 0%-10% (rounded estimate: 5%)
