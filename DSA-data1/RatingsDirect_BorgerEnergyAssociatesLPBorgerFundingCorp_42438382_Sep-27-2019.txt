Project Description
Borger Energy Associates L.P./Borger Funding Corp. (Borger) is a 230 megawatt natural gas-fired cogeneration facility
near Borger, Texas. Commercial operations began on June 12, 1999. The project sells its energy output and electrical
capacity to Southwestern Public Service Co. (SPS) under the terms of a 25-year power purchase agreement that
expires in June 2024. Additionally, the project sells its steam output to Phillips 66 under a 20-year steam sales and
operating agreement that expires in June 2024.

Credit Highlights
Overview
Key strengths

Key risks

The project's entire capacity is contracted under a power purchase agreement
with Southwestern Public Service Co. (SPS), which provides both fixed and
variable payments until June 2024.

The project's steam margins are directly exposed to the volatility
in natural gas prices and variable demand from the refinery
off-taker.

The increased steam factor and the addition of a fixed fee under the amended
steam agreement will help offset the cash flow decline from lower energy
margins.

Lack of adequate liquidity especially in years where debt service
coverage ratio (DSCR) is below 1.0x
The project has a weak distribution test that excludes major
maintenance funding and does not adequately reserve cash
ahead of the project's needs.

The project's entire capacity is contracted under a power purchase agreement with SPS, which
provides both fixed and variable payments until June 2024.
The project has a PPA with Southwestern Public Service Co. (A-/Stable/A-2), rated several notches higher than the
project. The project benefits from some cash flow certainty as the PPA with SPS provides capacity revenues based on
100% contract capacity and energy revenues based on dispatch. Additionally, the operations and maintenance (O&M)
payment, under the PPA, consists of both a fixed rate and a variable rate component. As per the terms of the PPA, the
capacity rate for the second half of 2019 will be reduced by approximately 40% as compared to the pricing in the first
half of the year. Subsequently, the capacity payment rate will be adjusted downward and we therefore expect the
project's capacity revenues to decline from 2019 until 2022. The project's energy payment is a product of gas price,
guaranteed heat rate, and energy delivered. Given our view of lower capacity factors and low gas prices, we anticipate
the project's energy revenues also will decline going forward.
We expect the debt service coverage ratio to be approximately 1.43x in 2019. The 2019 ratio is excluded from our

SEPTEMBER 11, 2019 2

Borger Energy Associates L.P./Borger Funding Corp.

analysis because of unusually high coverage due to a combination of lower debt service payments (the project's
scheduled amortization profile is front-loaded, with principal payments declining significantly after 2018) and high
contracted capacity payments, which will decline after 2019 as per the PPA.

The increased steam factor and the addition of a fixed fee under the amended steam agreement will
help offset the cash flow decline from lower energy margins.
Effective June 12, 2019, the project renewed its steam sales and operating agreement with WRB Refining L.P. (a joint
partnership between Phillips 66 and Cenovus Energy Inc.). The amended agreement brought in two key changes--an
increase in the steam factor and the addition of a fixed steam fee (escalated at CPI) to the steam revenues, both of
which improve the cash flow profile of the project. The payment of the fixed steam fee will be subject to certain
performance standards related to frequency of unplanned outages. The amended steam agreement enhances the
project's cash flows and will significantly help offset lower energy margins and the impact of falling gas prices on the
steam revenues. We anticipate that the steam revenues will account for over 40% of the project's revenues as
compared to approximately 35% before the amended agreement.

The project's steam margins are directly exposed to the volatility in natural gas prices and variable
demand from the refinery off-taker.
In addition to the steam factor and monthly fixed fee, the project's steam margins are also a function of off-taker
demand and natural gas prices. Although the amended steam agreement improves cash flows, the steam margins
remain directly exposed to the variable nature of demand from the refinery off-taker and natural gas price volatility.

We view the project's liquidity as critical to the current rating, especially in years when DSCR is less
than or close to 1.0x.
The availability of adequate liquidity is critical to make up debt service payments in years when cash flows are less
than sufficient. In our base case and downside case scenarios, the project generates a debt service coverage ratio
(DSCR) of below 1.0x in some years, we, therefore, monitor the project's liquidity carefully and identify it as a key risk
to the 'B-' rating. As on June 30, 2019, the project had sufficient liquidity in the form of cash and available reserves
(please see liquidity sections for details).

The project's distribution test is weaker compared with its peers.
The distribution test excludes major maintenance funding and therefore does not reserve adequate cash ahead of a
project need. We therefore assess structural protection as fair given the relatively weak distribution test. Because the
operations phase stand-alone credit profile (SACP) is already 'b-', we do not apply a further one-notch reduction,
leading to a final credit rating of 'B-'

Outlook

The stable outlook reflects our view that the project's successful renewal of its steam agreement and our current
assumptions on gas pricing, major maintenance funding, and operational performance support the 'B-' rating as
long as the project's liquidity does not significantly decline, which it does not under our base-case scenario. The
minimum DSCR of 0.78x occurs in 2020.

Downside scenario
A lower rating would most likely stem from operational issues or a deteriorating liquidity balance. Specifically, we
could lower the ratings if liquidity balances deteriorate such that the project cannot meet its full debt-service
obligations before depleting reserves. This situation could occur if the plant's operational performance weakens
and our assumptions for gas pricing decrease materially. We could also lower our rating on the project if we
downgrade the parent company or lower the rating on any of the irreplaceable revenue counterparties below the
rating on the project.

Upside scenario
Although we consider an upgrade less likely, we could raise the rating if the project maintains consistent operating
performance that results in a minimum DSCR in the middle of the of 1.0x-1.4x range, liquidity balances improve
significantly and remain consistently high relative to outstanding debt throughout the forecast period, and we rate
the parent company and the irreplaceable revenue counterparties above the project. In addition, an upgrade could
also result if the project's steam production remains steady, which combined with the provisions in the renewed
steam agreement, can generate cash flows sufficient to generate DSCRs in the middle of the 1.0x-1.4x range.

Performance Update
The project generated DSCR of 1.21x for year ended Dec. 31, 2018, which excludes funding for major maintenance.
After including major maintenance as an expense, DSCR would be 0.67x. This compares with S&P Global Ratings'
forecast DSCR of 0.97x. The actual DSCR was lower than our forecast primarily due to lower capacity factor and
higher major maintenance expenses from outages. The sponsor injected $2.8 million to cover the debt service shortfall.
The project continues to meet its availability target (92% target as per PPA) to receive full capacity payments. The
project generated an availability factor of 94.26% in 2018 (94.19% in 2017) against S&P Global Ratings' base-case
assumption of 92%. The year-to-date June 2019 availability, at 96.6%, has also been above the PPA target. The
availability factor was lower in both 2018 and 2017 compared with the project's historical performance due to
scheduled major maintenance outages to replace the CT rotors (CT rotor 1 was out of commission for 645.7 hours
during March 2017. CT 2 rotor was out of commission for 671.2 hours in March 2018).
The project's capacity factor has followed a declining trend due to a combination of the aforementioned outages and
lower demand from SPS. Capacity factor was 76.13% and 79.8% for the years ended 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Capacity factor for year-to-date June 2019 was 72.73%. We expect the capacity factor to trend lower compared with

SEPTEMBER 11, 2019 4

Borger Energy Associates L.P./Borger Funding Corp.

historical performance and have adjusted our base case lower leading to a decline in the projected energy revenues.
Steam production in 2018 was 8,281,244 Klbs, a 1% increase from the prior year due to higher demand from the steam
off-taker Phillips 66 (P66). Although steam production has consistently outpaced the project's expectation, we project a
decline in steam production from 2020-2022. As per the project, the refinery off-taker has provided guidance that
steam demand could be lower because of process improvements. As a result, we assume a decline in steam demand in
our base case. We will continue to monitor the project's steam production. If demand remains steady as in historical
years, we will revise our base-case forecast upward.

Key Metrics

• Henry Hub gas price of $2.25 in 2019, $2.50 in 2020,
$2.75 in 2021 and $3 in 2022. This translates into an
average annual gas price assumption, after
adjustments, for the Southwest Power Pool of about
$2.13 per million Btu for 2019 and 2020.

• Minimum DSCR: 0.78x (2020); and
• Average DSCR: 0.98x.

• Availability factor of 93.8%.
• Capacity factor of about 75%.
• All-in heat rate (including steam) of 13,200
Btu/kilowatt-hour from 2020 - 2022.
• Average yearly steam production of 7,380,935 klbs
from 2020 - 2022.
• Steam factor of 1.37.
• Fixed monthly steam payments of $250,000
beginning June 2019, increasing with inflation from
2020 onward.
• Major maintenance funding assumptions for the
next four years through 2022 stem from the major
maintenance guidance the project provided and
confirmed by an independent engineer.
• Inflation of 2%.

The project's closest peers are Orange Cogen Funding Corp. (Orange Cogen), Logan Generating Co. (Logan), and
Chambers Cogeneration L.P. (Chambers).
• Orange Cogen and Borger are gas-fired cogeneration plants under long-term PPAs with investment-grade
counterparties. Both projects have some market risk exposure because they have a higher operations phase
business assessment as compared to Logan and Chambers.
• Logan and Chambers are coal-fired cogeneration plants under long-term PPAs with investment-grade
counterparties with minimal market risk.
• The rating on Borger, which is the lowest among peers, is largely a function of a weak DSCR profile as compared to
peer projects, which have much stronger coverage ratios.

• Full credit guarantees: None
• Senior debt issue rating: 'B-'

Operations phase SACP
• We assess the project's operating phase business assessment as 7 on a 12-point scale on which 1 is the strongest.
The project's OPBA is typical for the asset type, a gas-fired cogeneration power plant with complex electrical and
mechanical engineering aspects and maintenance that requires specialty equipment. We assess market risk
exposure as low, competitive position as strong, and no country risk.
• Based on the OPBA of 7, the minimum debt service coverage of 0.78x is at the low end of the 'b' category range
under table 15 of our operations criteria, resulting in a preliminary operations phase SACP is 'b-'. The downside case
performance of the credit reflects the 'b' category, surviving stresses for less than three years, and results in adjusted
operations SACP after downside of 'b-'.
• The project's liquidity assessment is neutral, and there is no refinancing risk.

Project Counterparties
We rate all material irreplaceable counterparties above the project. The project has a capped parental linkage (WG
Partners Acquisition LLC). We also consider the energy off-taker Southwestern Public Service Co. and Phillips 66 to be
irreplaceable; if either rating goes below that on the project, we would lower the project rating.

Liquidity
We assess the project's liquidity as neutral. The project has a six-month debt service reserve of approximately $2.8
million. A letter of credit with MUFG Union Bank N.A. provides the reserve. The project has additional liquidity on its
balance sheet as restricted and unrestricted cash, totaling approximately $6 million as of June 30, 2019.

Other modifiers
The distribution test excludes major maintenance funding and therefore does not reserve adequate cash ahead of a
project need. We therefore assess structural protection as fair given the relatively weak distribution test. Because the
operations phase SACP is already 'b-', we do not apply a further one-notch reduction, leading to a final credit rating of
'B-'.

Recovery Analysis

Key analytical assumptions
• The recovery rating on the senior secured notes is '4', indicating prospects for average (30%-50%; rounded
estimate: 40%) recovery if a payment default occurs.
• For valuation, we assume the project would reorganize rather than be liquidated and that the PPA and the steam
agreement survive the reorganization.
• We analyzed recovery prospects through a discounted cash flow methodology, assessing the net present value
of future cash flows through the expected remaining asset life.

Simulated default assumptions
• Simulated year of default is 2020 and our discount rate is 12%. We assume that the project will emerge out of
default in 2021. Therefore, we revert to the base-case scenario at that time.
• Availability to decrease by 10% from our base-case levels from 2019-2020, base-case thereafter (2021-2022).
• Heat rate degrades by 10% from base-case levels from 2019-2020, base-case thereafter.
• 12% increase in non-fuel operations and maintenance (O&M) cost and major maintenance (MM) funding.
• Gas prices drop to levels commensurate with our downside case, at $2 per MMBtu.

Simplified waterfall
• Total debt outstanding: $8.7 million (Including a draw on the debt service reserve LOC and six months of
prepetition debt service)
• Gross enterprise value (future cash flows discounted at 12%): $4.14 million
• Less administrative costs at 3%: $0.207 million
• Net enterprise value: $3.9 million
• --Recovery = (net enterprise value/total debt outstanding) = 4 (rounded estimate: 40%, unchanged from last
year).
