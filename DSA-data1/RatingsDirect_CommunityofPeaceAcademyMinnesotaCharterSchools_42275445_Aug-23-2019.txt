Rationale
S&P Global Ratings assigned its 'BBB-' long-term rating to St. Paul Housing and Development Authority, Minn.'s series
2019 lease revenue bonds, issued for the Community of Peace Academy (CPA), through its affiliate, the Community of
Peace Building Co. Simultaneously, S&P Global Ratings affirmed its 'BBB-' long-term rating on the school's outstanding
series 2015A and series 2015B lease revenue refunding bonds, issued for CPA. The outlook is stable.
We assessed CPA's enterprise profile as adequate, characterized by the academy's long institutional tenure, stable
enrollment, which is expected to grow with the expansion in elementary grades, acceptable academic performance,
and competent management team governed by a robust set of board policies and practices. We assessed CPA's
financial profile as adequate, based on its history of positive full-accrual operations, steady coverage and liquidity
levels, although we understand the school will utilize a one-time $1.8 million fund balance drawdown in fiscal 2020 for
expansion costs. We expect the academy to maintain pro forma maximum annual debt service (MADS) coverage and
liquidity sufficient for the rating. We believe that combined, these credit factors lead to an indicative stand-alone credit
profile of 'bbb-', and a final rating of 'BBB-'.
The school's total capacity will increase following the academy's expansion plans to approximately 1,050 by the
2024-2025 school year. Construction is expected to start in fall of 2019 and be completed by mid-August 2020, in time
for the facility to open for the 2020-2021 school year. While expansion risks exist, we believe this is partly mitigated by
the school's history of consistent enrollment, superior retention rates, and limited need to grow enrollment to meet its
future debt service payments associated with the new facility.
The rating reflects our view of the academy's:
• Sufficient pro forma MADS coverage of 1.32x based on fiscal 2018 audited figures, although annual debt service
coverage is higher at nearly 2x;
• Moderate pro forma days' cash on hand of 118 days based on fiscal 2018 audited figures, after accounting for a
planned drawdown of funds associated with the aforementioned expansion project;
• Solid relationship with its authorizer, the University of St. Thomas (UST), which granted CPA a five-year contract
renewal, marking the second renewal for a maximum term;

AUGUST 19, 2019 2

Community of Peace Academy, Minnesota; Charter Schools

• Long and stable 24-year history of operations; and
• Experienced and capable management team, supported by an active and effective governance board.
The preceding positive credit factors are partly offset by the following factors:
• Expansion risk, given CPA's plan to add additional elementary grade sections over the next few years;
• Increased MADS burden with the series 2019 debt issuance; and
• The inherent uncertainty associated with charter renewals because the final maturity of the bonds exceeds the time
horizon of the existing charter.
The series 2019 bonds will be on parity with CPA's outstanding series 2015 bonds. The bonds are secured by revenue
of CPA, which consists primarily of per-pupil funding from Minnesota. The bonds are further secured by a fully funded
debt service reserve in addition to a capital improvement fund. Proceeds will be used to construct a three-story
addition to the school's existing building consisting of 14 new classrooms, breakout rooms, an enlarged kitchen and
multipurpose room totaling approximately 30,000 square feet. The project will also consist of various capital upgrades,
including a heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system upgrade and installation of a new fire suppression
system.
Covenants include 60 days' cash on hand and 1.0x annual debt service coverage (DSC). If debt service falls below 1.1x,
but remains above 1.0x, management may be required to engage a consultant acceptable to the issuer to improve
coverage. Failure to maintain at least 1.0x DSC will constitute an event of default. The bonds have an additional bonds
test of 1x historical MADS coverage (audited) and 1.25x projected MADS coverage, starting in fiscal 2022. Total pro
forma debt for CPA is approximately $21.5 million.
The academy is a public charter school in St. Paul, established in 1995 and currently serves approximately 785
pre-kindergarten (pre-K) to 12th grade students. The school's mission focuses on fostering academic excellence and
prioritizing character and moral development.

Outlook
The stable outlook reflects our expectation that over the two-year outlook period, CPA will moderate its debt burden,
while growing enrollment in line with management's projections. We understand fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 results are
likely to be weaker due to non-recurring expansion costs, however we expect the school to sustain sufficient MADS
coverage and liquidity in line with the rating

Downside scenario
We could consider a negative rating action should any enrollment or funding pressures constrain operations, such that
MADS coverage or liquidity declines more than expected. Additionally, if CPA experiences any project delays or is
unable to meet enrollment projections, we would view this negatively.

Upside scenario
A positive rating action is unlikely during the outlook period, given CPA's expansion plans and current financial
metrics.

Enterprise Profile
Economic fundamentals
CPA is in Ramsey County, which is located in the Minneapolis- St. Paul metropolitan statistical area. The county's
school-age population is healthy at about 187,000. The projected five-year school age population is expected to fall
slightly at 0.2%.

Industry risk
Industry risk addresses the charter school sector's overall cyclicality and competitive risk and growth by applying
various stress scenarios and evaluating barriers to entry, levels and trends of profitability, substitution risk, and growth
trends observed in the industry. We believe the charter school sector represents a moderately high credit risk when
compared with other industries and sectors.

Market position
CPA has been at its current site since its inception in 1995 and is located on the east side of St. Paul. Students are local
with a majority living in the St. Paul Public School district. The academy serves a predominantly underprivileged
population with 86% qualifying for free (or reduced) lunch and roughly one-third designated English language learners
based on fall 2018 figures.
Fall 2018 enrollment was 803 students. Enrollment has historically remained stable and been around the 780 range
over the past few years. We understand the improvement in 2018 was due to lower attrition and possible overenrolling
by the school at each grade level; the school expects enrollment to moderate to 785 students for the upcoming
2019-2020 school year. The waitlist has shown gradual improvement and is nearly 21% of total enrollment at 166
students. We believe CPA's competitive landscape is modest given the academy's academic focus and small class
sizes. Student retention rates are high and was 95% in 2018.
In the first year of the expansion, CPA intends to increase enrollment in grades K, first and sixth to 75 students.
Management is targeting an enrollment of 921 students in 2020 and eventually will build up to facility capacity in 2025.
CPA believes that the additional section in the sixth grade will allow the school to better match the natural break in
public schools, which are organized as K-5. Afterwards, the school plans to naturally roll up to grades 2-5, until the
school reaches full capacity. Management believes that the addition of a third section of elementary school grades will
help to stabilize middle school academics and improve high school attrition rates. In our view, while there are
expansion risks, we believe these risks are somewhat offset by the school's history of consistent enrollment, strong
retention rates, and limited need to grow enrollment to meet future debt service payments
We consider the academy's test scores on par with those of the local school district while its growth indicators are
stronger. Overall, CPA performed comparable to or above comparable schools and the district with particularly high
growth at the high school level. The high school was previously designated as a Reward School back in 2014 and a

Community of Peace Academy, Minnesota; Charter Schools

Celebration School in 2015.
Middle school performance was not as strong as elementary and high school, although we understand the school has
taken on various initiatives such as partnering with the University of Chicago's Urban Education Institute back in 2015
to add a literacy assessment and instruction initiative. This included instructional coaches, a revised teacher evaluation
plan, and a reconfigured administrative leadership model. CPA's graduation rate of 86% in 2018 is good and has
consistently exceeded state and district averages. Additionally, the authorizer reported that 98% of CPA's graduating
seniors were accepted into a two-year or four-year college or university.
The statutory framework assessment reflects our opinion that, while there may be some areas of risk, the framework is
not likely to weaken its future ability to pay debt service. In Minnesota, operating revenue is based primarily on state
funding through general education and lease aid.
State per-pupil funding increased to $6,312 per student for fiscal 2019 from $6,188 for the previous school year. Lease
aid is paid at the lesser of 90% of the approved lease cost or $1,314 per-pupil unit. The state's most recent legislative
session approved an increase in the state aid formula by 2% for the next two years. We understand the school is
conservatively budgeting a 1.5% increase in revenue in fiscal 2022
UST has been the school's authorizer since 2011, when it took over as authorizer from St. Paul Public schools. UST
most recently renewed CPA's charter in 2018 for a maximum five-year term. This marks CPA's second maximum
renewal with UST. Based on feedback from the authorizer, we believe CPA maintains a positive relationship with UST.
UST interacts multiple times with CPA, including attending board meetings and doing multiple site visits every year.
The school remains in good standing with UST, which has indicated it has no significant concerns regarding the school
at this time. The authorizer is supportive of the school's expansion plans.

Management and governance
CPA handles most operations in house, with the exception of its financial function, which it contracts to Bergan KDV
(BKDV). BKDV was formed when Beltz, Kes, Darling & Associates, merged with BKDV in 2017. BKDA has had a
long-standing relationship with the academy, and all parties report that the firm is vital to CPA's operations. While this
creates some concentration in both institutional knowledge and day-to-day operations, we believe that financial
management and policies at the school are strong, as demonstrated by a five-year long-range budget and projection
model.
The board updated its bylaws in 2016 to include a change in board structure from a 13-member board with teacher
majority, to a nine-member board comprising three teachers, three parents, and three community members. The
school board holds elections annually, and all members serve three-year staggered terms with an option for renewal.
The board has multiple standing committees that meet on a monthly basis and provide additional oversight.
Management notes that the current executive director will be leaving at the end of the 2019-2020 school year after
having worked for 17 years at the school in various roles. We understand the board of directors has already hired a
new executive director, who is beginning his transition into his new role. The incoming executive director has served
as a director of another charter school in Minneapolis since 2015 and has prior school leadership experience with
Minneapolis Public Schools. We expect a smooth leadership transition given the long lead time and support from the

Community of Peace Academy, Minnesota; Charter Schools

current executive director. Aside from the school bringing on a new elementary school principal, there are no
additional changes expected.

Financial Profile
We analyze the materiality, strategy, and funding of pension plan separately from our analysis of a school's long-term
debt ratios or operating margin. Consequently, we may make certain adjustments to the calculations of debt ratios or
operating margin for schools with substantial multiemployer cost-sharing defined benefit pension plans to separate out
the net pension liability or noncash expense accrual. In our view, these adjustments enhance analytical clarity from a
credit perspective and result in more comparable debt and operating metrics across accounting methods.

Financial performance
In our opinion, CPA's financial performance can be characterized by consistent surpluses on a full accrual basis, aside
from a one-time deficit in fiscal 2016 due to a bond refinancing. Based on the fiscal 2018 audit, the academy produced
a $520,000 full-accrual surplus (4.5% excess margin), after we adjusted out accrued pension expenses. EBIDA was
approximately $1.8 million, or 15.5%. For fiscal 2019, unaudited figures show that the school outperformed its revised
budget. Management expects to end the year with a similar surplus to fiscal 2018.
Management is budgeting for a deficit in fiscal 2020, due to the expected $1.8 million draw down in fund balance for
the HVAC update, and a smaller deficit in fiscal 2021 incorporating the expansion costs. We believe management
budgets conservatively, including a 2% increase in salaries and benefits and 1.5% increase in costs in its long-range
budget model. The school typically outperforms its adopted budget.
According to our calculations, pro forma MADS coverage falls to 1.32x in fiscal 2018 after incorporating the additional
debt. We still view coverage as sufficient for the rating given the schools historically strong track record of positive
operations and coverage. Projected debt service gradually steps up from $889,000 in fiscal 2018 to $1.37 million in
fiscal 2026. This includes capitalized interest through fiscal 2020, followed by interest only payments in fiscal 2021 and
fiscal 2022. CPA's first principal and interest payment is due in fiscal 2023, which we believe gives the school some
time to grow enrollment levels to meet increasing debt service requirements. While we expect operating expenditures
to increase given the expansion costs, we also expect revenues to expand, given CPA's growing enrollment base,
allowing the academy to maintain balance operations. We expect CPA's financial performance to remain steady and
coverage to remain consistent with the rating level.

Liquidity and financial flexibility
In our opinion, CPA's liquidity position has strengthened in recent years, although we understand that the school plans
to draw down approximately $1.8 million in fiscal 2020 for the expansion project. As of June 30, 2018, the academy
had approximately $5.2 million of unrestricted cash, or 180 days' cash on hand, which is an increase from 164 days in
the previous year. Based on management's projections, days' cash on hand will drop to around 113 days' in fiscal 2020
and is expected to grow back to historical levels gradually over time.

Debt burden
Pro forma MADS translates to what we consider a moderate debt burden of 11.8% based on fiscal 2018 operating
revenue. We expect the increase in debt service to gradually be followed by an increase in higher revenue from the
increase in students. As many charter schools, the organization's debt-to-capitalization ratio shows significant leverage
on the balance sheet; pro forma figures indicate approximately 80% based on the series 2019 debt. Additionally, pro
forma debt is high at just over $27,000, but is expected to initially step down to $25,000 in fiscal 2020 and gradually
step down toward $20,000 as the school adds additional students. We understand the school has no additional debt
plans beyond the series 2019 bonds.
Employees of CPA participate in cost-sharing multiple-employer pension plans, including the General Employees
Retirement Fund (GERF), which is administered by the Public Employees Retirement Association of Minnesota (PERA)
and the Teacher's Retirement Association (TRA). Required pension contributions to these plans are determined by
state statute. Statutory contributions rates have generally not kept pace with actuarially determined contribution
(ADC) rates, although the 2018 legislative session resulted in significant pension reform that increased both employer
and employee contributions bringing funding closer to the ADC. We expect the statutory contributions to be closer to
the ADC in fiscal 2019.
As of the June 30, 2018 measurement date, the TRA and GERF plans were funded at 78.0% and 79.5%, respectively.
We understand the funded ratio for the TRA plan improved in 2018, because it was no longer required to use a single
equivalent discount rate, and instead will now use a blended rate of the long-term expected rate of return and a
municipal bond rate under GASB 67 and 68 reporting. This is a significant change from the previous fiscal year, when
the discount rate was 5.12%, and as a result significantly decreased the plan's unfunded liability and improved the
plan's funded ratio (previously at 51.6% in fiscal 2017). If the statutory contributions keep pace with the ADC, we
expect to see additional funding improvement in fiscal 2019 and beyond.
While we believe the history of pension contributions below the ADC increases the risk of payment acceleration, we
do not believe the potential for increased contributions is likely to result in budget stress during the outlook period, as
CPA's contributions are currently a manageable 3.6% of total expenditures. However, in the future, if pension
contributions absorb a larger share of the CPA's budget, our view of its debt burden profile could weaken.
For more information on the plan, please see the debt and liabilities section in the state report, published July 24, 2019,
on RatingsDirect.

Financial policies
CPA has formal policies for investment allocation, liquidity, and debt. The academy meets standard annual disclosure
requirements. The financial policies assessment reflects our opinion that, while there may be some areas of risk, the
organization's overall financial policies are not likely to weaken its future ability to pay debt service. Our analysis of
financial policies includes a review of the organization's financial reporting and disclosure, investment allocation and
liquidity, debt profile, contingent liabilities, and legal structure and a comparison of these policies to comparable
providers.
