Project Description
Tenaska Georgia Partners L.P. (TGP) is a 945-megawatt (MW) gas-fired, simple-cycle peaking facility located 40 miles
southwest of Atlanta. TC Generation LLC (35%), Diamond Generating Corp. (30%), and affiliates of Tenaska (35%)
own the project.
The project generates capacity and energy revenue under the terms of a 29-year tolling agreement with Exelon
Generation Co. LLC (Exelon; BBB+/Stable/A-2). General Electric Co. (GE; BBB+/Stable/A-2) provides maintenance
services under a long-term service agreement (LTSA).
The project's developer, Tenaska, has constructed more than 10,000 MW of domestic and international generation
capacity projects.

Contractual framework that considerably limits volatility of cash flows Rating capped by the creditworthiness of Exelon
A simpler mechanical process as a peaking facility

Retained operational risks

A well-structured LTSA with GE

The project has a strong contractual framework that considerably limits cash flow volatility.
• The tolling contract fully allocates market demand, price, fuel supply, and electric transmission risks to Exelon. The
contractual nature of the project makes it relatively insensitive to the dispatch factor and eliminates exposure to fuel
expenses.
• Capacity payments cover fixed expenses and debt service. Start-charge and energy payments compensate TGP for
incremental operations and maintenance (O&M) expenses, and the project has limited sensitivity under our stress
cases.
• Risk of contract termination is low. Exelon can terminate the power purchase agreement(PPA) after 20 years of
commercial operation by providing one year's advanced notice and paying the partnership $175 million.

The project's operating performance has been stable, benefiting from a simpler mechanic process and
a well-structured LTSA.
• The project has operated well since being commissioned and maintained availabilities at or near 100%. As a
simple-cycle peaking facility, the project runs for shorter periods and uses a simpler mechanical process than
base-load, combined-cycle natural gas power plants. In addition, routine maintenance has ensured that the project
has not experienced any major or forced outages.
• The LTSA with GE is structured to allow for recovery of lost capacity payments if the project fails to maintain the
availabilities mandated under the PPA with Exelon.

Exelon's credit quality caps the project rating.
• Exelon is the project's sole revenue counterparty. Although the project might be able to sell in the spot market or
recontract with another off-taker, we wouldn't expect it to meet its debt service obligations as a merchant facility;
therefore, the rating on the project cannot be higher than that on the PPA counterparty, Exelon.

Bondholders bear operating risks if the project cannot meet the operational thresholds mandated
under the tolling agreement.
• The credit risk of the project is primarily tied to the possibility of forced outages or mechanical failures, which could
lead to underperformance relative to TGP's contractual obligations under its tolling PPA.
• If the plant fails to meet the required availability targets, financial penalties could apply, leading to reduced cash
flow available for debt service and a low debt service coverage ratio (DSCR). However, the LTSA with GE largely
mitigates this risk.

Outlook

The stable outlook reflects our expectation that operational and financial performance will remain stable during
our two-year outlook period. We expect the project to generate DSCRs above 1.48x throughout the debt's term.

Downside scenario
We could lower the rating if the project's DSCR falls to and stays at the lower end of the 1.2x-1.4x range. This
could happen if availability falls below 93%. We could also lower the rating if we lowered the rating on Exelon
below 'BBB+'.

Upside scenario
Given that TGP's strong operational and financial performance would otherwise support a higher rating, we could
raise the rating on TGP if we raised the rating on Exelon above 'BBB+' and our operational expectations and
base-case financial forecast do not change. Further improvement in our base-case financial projections for the
project would not lead to a higher rating by itself.

Performance Update
• The capacity factor under the PPA for the contract year ended May 31, 2018, and for 10 months of the next contract
year ended May 31, 2019, was 1.49% and 1.04%, respectively. As a peaking power plant, TGP is used relatively
infrequently, with dispatch levels historically varying from 0.1%-4.4%. Due to the contractual structure, the project's
cash flow is not highly sensitive to the level of power it is required to generate.
• Annual and summer availability was 100% for the PPA contract year ended May 31, 2018, and for 10 months of the
next contract year ended May 31, 2019, above the 97% target. TGP's performance has been stable, with the annual
and summer availability each coming in at 99% or more since it began commercial operation.
• The project's DSCR for fiscal 2018 was 1.54x, above management's expectation of 1.49x and S&P Global Ratings'
forecast of 1.48x, due to higher energy and start revenues and lower operating expenses. Coverage levels have been
remarkably steady over the past five years, averaging 1.48x, and this stability points to the project's lack of
sensitivity to variance in market demand as per the contractual framework.
• We expect DSCRs of 1.50x and 1.51x for the years ending Dec. 31, 2019, and Dec. 31, 2020, respectively.

*DSCR ranges include values at the lower but not upper bound. For example, for a range of 1.20x-1.10x, a value of 1.20x is excluded while a
value of 1.10x is included. §To determine the outcome in these cells, the key factors are typically the forecasted minimum DSCR (with at least
1.05x generally required for the 'BB' category), as well as relative break-even performance and liquidity levels. Please see "Project Finance:

The project's closest peers are some other Tenaska projects, including Tenaska Virginia Partners L.P. and Tenaska
Alabama II Partners L.P.
• Similar to the project, both peers are gas-fired power plants and have tolling agreements that result in no market
exposure. In addition, all projects' revenues have a low sensitivity to dispatch factors.
• All three projects have LTSAs with GE for equipment-related issues.
• As a peaking facility, the project involves a simpler mechanical process and is run less often. Therefore, the
operations phase business assessment is '4', lower than that of its base-load peers.
• The higher rating on the project reflects a lower business risk profile and a stronger DSCR profile. The project rating
is constrained by that on Exelon.

Operations phase SACP
• Our operations phase business assessment of '4' reflects the project's asset class as a natural gas peaking power
plant, its operating history, and contractual revenue with very low market exposure. As a simple-cycle peaking
facility, TGP runs for shorter periods and uses a simpler mechanical process than base-load combined-cycle natural
gas power plants.
• The minimum DSCR of 1.48x under our base-case scenario leads to a preliminary operations phase SACP of 'a-'.
The project's performance under the downside case is consistent with the 'a' category, resulting in a preliminary
SACP of 'a-'. Although TGP's operational risk profile and DSCR would support an 'A-' rating, the rating on the
off-taker constrains the rating on the project.

Operations counterparties
• We view Exelon as material and irreplaceable in our counterparty dependency assessment and the rating on Exelon
caps the rating on the project, regardless of operational performance.
• LTSA counterparty GE covers the services associated with repairs, mechanical outages inspection, and overhaul
services. We treat GE as a replaceable counterparty.
• The project's financial counterparties, including MUFG Union Bank NA (A/Positive/A-1) and The Bank of New
York Mellon(AA-/Stable/A-1+), do not constrain the project rating.

Liquidity
• We assess the project's liquidity as neutral, and sufficient to backstop near-term obligations.
• Liquidity is primarily supported through a six-month debt service reserve account funded via a line of credit (LOC)
facility with a maximum commitment of $17 million.
• In addition, the project has access to an LOC facility of $25 million to support its obligation under the PPA and an
LOC for $0.1 million to support obligations under the interconnection agreement. As of March 31, 2019, no funds
had been drawn on either LOC. The project had unrestricted cash on hand of $6.4 million as of March 31, 2019.
