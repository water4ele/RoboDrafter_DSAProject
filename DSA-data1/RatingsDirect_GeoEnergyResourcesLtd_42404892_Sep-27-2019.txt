Key Risks

Sound cost position with low strip ratio.

Potential refinancing risks in the absence of mine acquisition.

Sufficient interest coverage and sizable cash balances. Limited growth potential due to domestic production quota.
Modest production, single mineral and mine concentration with short reserve life.
High sensitivity of earnings and hence credit metrics to fluctuations in coal prices.

Geo Energy Resources Ltd. (GERL) faces mounting refinancing risks given the lack of investment in its reserves base.
GERL has yet to deploy the bond proceeds it raised during the last quarter of 2017. Bondholders have the option to put
the notes in April 2021 in the absence of investment in reserves from the company. We believe the company's
bargaining power may progressively erode as negotiations on potential acquisitions move closer to the date of the put.
Furthermore, GERL's ability to raise additional funds to support an acquisition is untested given uncertain market
sentiment and the incurrence covenants on the company's notes.
A subdued pricing environment and constraints on production growth will weigh on GERL's creditworthiness. The
company's operating performance has been subdued since the last quarter of 2018 due to low coal prices. We believe
prices are unlikely to rebound given growing imbalances between regional demand and supply. In addition, we
anticipate limited growth in production given quota limits set by Indonesian mining authorities. Moreover, higher
output would accelerate the depletion of the company's mineral reserves.

Outlook: Negative

The negative outlook reflects our view that GERL could face difficulty repaying the bonds if the company is not
able to increase reserves without significantly raising its leverage while bondholders exercise the put option in
April 2021.

Downside scenario
We could lower the rating if GERL's financial commitments increasingly appear to be unsustainable. This would
happen if the company fails to add to its reserves in the next few months, making a bond redemption in April 2021
increasingly likely. We could also lower the rating if realized prices remain low, with EBITDA per ton sustainably
below US$3.

Upside scenario
We would revise the outlook to stable if GERL acquires new mines with established operations, increasing total
reserves and removing refinancing risk in early 2021. A revision in the outlook would also require the company to
maintain sufficient liquidity as a cushion against price and margin fluctuations through a pricing cycle, to support
its ability to meet its debt obligations.

Assumptions

• GDP growth of about 5% in Indonesia; and about
6% on average in China and 7% in India, two
countries that are major consumers and importers of
coal.
• Coal prices to remain volatile with average realized
prices per ton in the US$34-US$36 range,
benchmarked to the Indonesian Coal Index, less
US$2-US$3 per ton marketing fee.
• Production of 7.5 to 8.0 million metric tons (MMT)
in 2019 and subsequently to plateau around 8 MMT
in view of the cap by Indonesian mining authorities.

• Cash costs per ton to be relatively stable and
average around US$29-US$31, in view of contracted
mining operations.
• EBITDA of US$30 million-US$40 million through
2021.
• Capital expenditure to be below US$5 million
annually because the company contracts processing
and transportation to third parties.
• Dividends of about 30% of prior year's income.

Base-case projections
Soft coal prices could persist. Following 24 months of strong coal prices, prices have declined since the last quarter of
2018 due to persistent oversupply in part from U.S. exports, as well as dampened demand from China. The slump is
further exacerbated by rising competition globally from cleaner, renewable energy such as wind, solar, and cheap
natural gas. Continued weakness in coal prices would pressure GERL's earnings and hence credit metrics.
Production to remain modest, in the absence of acquisitions. We expect GERL's output to be up to 8 MMT through
2021 given the production quota stipulated by Indonesian mining authorities. In the absence of acquisitions, we also
believe GERL will be cautious in ramping up production quickly in view of declining reserves. Should incidents of
flooding persist in the second half of the year, production could be lower.

Company Description
Established in 2008 and listed in Singapore since 2012, GERL is a holding company that controls a group of coal
mining companies in Indonesia. It owns four assets in Kalimantan, with the production concentrated on two main
assets in one seam, PT Sungai Danau Jaya (SDJ) and PT Tanah Bumbu Resources (TBR). The company has combined
reserves of over 80 MMT as of 2018. During the year, the company produced 7.9 MMT of coal, generated US$299
million of revenue and US$66 million of EBITDA. In the first half of 2019, GERL reported EBITDA of US$10 million

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 6, 2019 4

Geo Energy Resources Ltd.

from coal production of 3.6 MMT.

Business Risk: Vulnerable
GERL's modest size, high profitability sensitivity to fluctuations in coal prices, as well as limited growth potential due
to the domestic production quota continue to constrain the company's earnings quality. Tempering these weaknesses
are the company's low cash costs and stable relationship with its mining contractors.
Modest production and scale. We regard GERL's narrow asset diversity as a main credit constraint. The company
operates on a small scale and produced 7.9 MMT of coal in 2018.
The company is highly dependent on two mining assets, SDJ and TBR, the former accounting for 89% of production
volume in 2018. Average reserve life was about 10 years on Dec. 31, 2018, which is short compared with its peers like
Coronado Global Resources Inc. (35 years; B+/Stable/--) and PT Bumi Resources Tbk. (20 years; CCC+/Stable/--).
Although we expect more contribution from TBR going forward, declining reserves at the SDJ mine will continue to
limit total production. We estimate the reserve life at SDJ to be less than seven years. The mine at PT Surya Tambang
Tolindo (STT) is still in the exploratory phase and the company has not forecast any meaningful production from
there. Production from PT Bumi Enggang Khatulistiwa (BEK) mine is also likely to be minimal at about 1 MMT.

Susceptibility in earnings and credit metrics to fluctuations in coal prices. GERL's cash flow generation is highly
sensitive to fluctuations in coal prices. For the first half of 2019, the average selling prices (ASP) dipped to
US$33.9/MT, down 24% from the first half of 2018. As a result, reported EBITDA in the period reduced to US$10
million with production volumes of 3.6 MMT compared to US$44 million and production volumes of 3.8 MMT a year
before. Cash profit per ton fell to US$5.5 from US$13.0. We estimate every US$1 change in ASP to result in a 2%-3%
change in funds from operations (FFO) to debt.
Chart 2

Limited growth potential due to domestic production quota. The Domestic Market Obligation (DMO) in Indonesia
requires local coal companies to sell at least 25% of their production to the domestic market and cap the selling price
of coal to the state-owned electricity firm, Perusahaan Perseroan (Persero) PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN;
BBB/Stable/--).
GERL's target for production and sales of at least 8 MMT of coal for both SDJ and TBR in 2019 was based on the
quota received and set out by the Indonesian mining authorities in the Rencana Kerja Anggaran Biaya (RKAB).
Although the company plans to apply for an additional 2 MMT in 2019, this is subject to approval. In addition,
companies that are noncompliant with the production cap may have their quota reduced. The company had complied
with its DMO requirements as of June 30, 2019, and barring any unforeseen circumstances, will meet its full-year
DMO requirement in 2019.
Low cash costs and stable relationship with mining contractor. GERL's cash costs of US$30.8/ton in 2018 is among the
lowest of its peers like PT Bayan Resources Tbk. (US$33.3/ton; B+/Stable/--) and Bumi (US$35.1/ton). Supporting
GERL's low cash costs is its low strip ratio, averaging about 3.3x. The ratio is likely to decline further, especially for the
TBR mine after the company completes prestripping. In the first semester of 2019, cash cost decreased further to
US$28.4/ton. This was mainly due to a reduction in overburden distance and renegotiations with suppliers to lower
costs in the second quarter, in line with weak coal prices.

In addition, the company has been outsourcing mining operations to PT Bukit Makmur Mandiri Utama (BUMA) since
2015, significantly reducing its capital spending and working capital requirements. Given the fairly stable stripping
ratios, we expect GERL to sustain this cost position over the next few years.

We consider Bayan, Bumi, and Mongolian Mining Corp. (MMC; B-/Stable/--) as GERL's close peers, given their
similar operations in coal mining, comparable production scale and coal quality, and country risks. Coronado is
another peer, but it has lower country risks due to the location of its operations in the U.S. and Australia.

SEPTEMBER 6, 2019 7

GERL, Bumi, and Bayan have similar jurisdiction and mining license-related exposure with operations in Indonesia. As
such, coal quality and type are similar (lower calorific quality, ash, and sulphur content). The prices of coal produced
by GERL, Bayan, and Bumi tend to be at a discount to the benchmark Newcastle price to account for the lower
calorific content. In comparison, Coronado's mines offer a wide array of metallurgical coal that have higher selling
prices compared with thermal coal. Similarly, MMC specializes in coking coal.
GERL is similar to Bumi and Bayan in their asset concentration of one to two mines as compared with Coronado,
which has four large operating assets located in the U.S. and Australia. In terms of production volume, GERL is much
smaller compared with its local peers, with Bayan producing 28 MMT and Bumi 85 MMT in 2018.
GERL's customer geographical concentration is largely skewed to China, which contributes more than 80% of
revenues. This is similar to MMC, given the land-bound nature of the company's operations. Coronado, on the other
hand, is much more diversified, selling 52% to the international market and remaining 48% to domestic markets in
Australia and the U.S.
In terms of operating efficiency, GERL has one of the lowest cash costs of US$30.8/ton, comparable with Bayan's
US$33.3/ton as of 2018. Both are in the first quartile of the global cost curve, given the calorific value and low strip
ratios. Bumi's cash costs are slightly higher at US$35.1/ton. MMC's cost position lies in a higher quartile owing largely
to high transportation costs. On the other hand, Coronado's portfolio operates within the first and second quartile
because the majority of its capacity is in opencast mining, which has lower production costs compared with
underground mines.
Nevertheless, GERL's ASP is markedly lower than its local peers'. In 2018, its ASP was US$42.1/ton as compared with
Bayan's US$58.5/ton and Bumi's US$59.2/ton. This is largely attributable to the lower average calorific content of its
coal. MMC and Coronado fetch higher ASPs given their sales concentration in metallurgical coal.

Chart 3

As such, GERL reported a lower average EBITDA margin of 20%-25% and average EBITDA per ton of US$9-US$11
for the past two years, compared with Bayan of over 40% and about US$25/ton, respectively. Meanwhile, Coronado's
and MMC's EBITDA margins are over 25%. Bumi, on the other hand, is on the weaker end of the spectrum, with
EBITDA margins of less than 10%.
In terms of leverage, Bayan is the strongest among its peers, with negligible debt. Coronado's credit metrics are also
much stronger than GERL's, but could weaken due to its ownership by a financial sponsor. Both MMC and GERL carry
high leverage. Bumi's capital structure highly exposes the company to coal prices, because all cash is upstreamed on a
quarterly basis to accelerate the repayment of its first tranche of debt.

Financial Risk: Highly leveraged
Our view of GERL's balance sheet reflects its high leverage in view of weaker earnings from declines in production and
low coal prices.
Sustained debt. The only debt on the company's balance sheet comprises US$300 million of senior unsecured notes
issued since September 2017 with a maturity in April 2022. The company intends to use its cash balance--which stood
at US$200 million as of June 30, 2019--for mine acquisitions. If the company is unable to make significant acquisitions,
then it could be forced to use the cash to fund the put option on the bonds.
Deterioration in leverage. The company's adjusted FFO to debt declined to 7.7% in 2018 from 20.3% in 2017, due to
subdued earnings on the back of lower sales volumes, higher operating costs at its TBR mine, as well as dampened
coal prices toward the last quarter of 2018. We anticipate that leverage could deteriorate further in 2019 with FFO to
debt dipping below 5x in 2019 on the back of weaker earnings and elevated debt.

Liquidity: Adequate
We expect GERL's liquidity sources to cover its needs adequately due to limited debt maturities over the next 12
months. However, the company has a limited track record compared with peers', and is relatively new in the U.S.
dollar capital markets. We also expect the company to have access to prepayment of production by off-takers, which
could provide an additional source of funds. We do not view the company's funding position as providing protection
against a low-probability, high-impact event due to project and regional concentration in SDJ and TBR.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

Covenant Analysis
Requirements
The senior unsecured notes do not have financial maintenance covenants but have two incurrence covenants. These
include debt-to-EBITDA ratio below 3.5x and fixed charge coverage ratio above 3.0x.
In addition, there is another covenant that mandates GERL to provide an offer to purchase the notes at par plus
accrued interest after three and a half years if certain conditions are not met. At any time prior to three and a half years
from the date of issuance:
• The company must have 120 MMT of reserves and any new incremental reserves must be from producing mines
with a minimum license expiry of eight years; or
• At three and a half years from the date of issuance, the company must have 80 MMT of reserves, all of which must
be from mines with licenses that expire in or after 2025.

Geo Energy Resources Ltd.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

We view governance factors as most important to our analysis, though environmental factors are also material.
This is because the company has not been able to execute its strategic plans. GERL issued US$300 million in notes
at 8% in 2017, but has yet to utilize the proceeds, resulting in elevated leverage and interest expense.
This also increases refinancing risk due to a potential put option in 2021 should the minimum reserve requirement
not be met. The put option, if exercised, could drive lower ratings over the next couple years if the company
remains unable to execute its acquisition strategy. In addition, management has not been consistent with its
production targets.
GERL and other coal producers face risks related to global energy transition and carbon emissions targets.
International and domestic environmental regulations could affect long-term financial metrics. Flooding, in
particular, has been cited as leading to decreased production for GERL. However, while we view environmental
risks as material, they are similar to those faced by other coal mining companies and unlikely to affect the rating at
current levels. GERL has a sound safety record with no major injuries or fatalities in 2018, and we view social
factors as less material.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
GERL's rated borrowings include US$300 million senior unsecured notes issued by Geo Coal International Pte. Ltd.
(GCI) in 2017 and unconditionally guaranteed by GERL and substantially all of the company's subsidiaries. These
notes are currently the only significant debt.

Analytical conclusions
All of the company's assets are located in Indonesia, a jurisdiction that we consider to have weak rule of law, lack of
creditor-friendly features, and lack of consistency in the conformity of the distribution of proceeds to legal rankings of
claims. Accordingly, we believe recovery prospects in the event of bankruptcy are uncertain in the country. Therefore,
we equalize the rating on the notes with the 'B-' issuer credit rating on the company.
