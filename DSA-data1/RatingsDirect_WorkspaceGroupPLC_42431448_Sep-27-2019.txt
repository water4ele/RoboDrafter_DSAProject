Overview
Key Strengths

Key Risks

Long track record of operating as a flexible office landlord; the company was
established in 1987.

Shorter and more flexible lease terms compared to traditional
office REITs, which limits visibility on long-term cash-flow
stability.

Prudent balance sheet with relatively low leverage and commitment to maintain a
loan-to-value (LTV) ratio below 30% (translating into our ratio of debt to debt plus
equity of less than 32%).

Relatively small portfolio size compared to other rated peers
and concentration purely in one city, London.

Workspace will continue to benefit from the growing demand coming from the
flexible office sector in London.

Relatively small absolute EBITDA base and large
development capital expenditure (capex) needs.

Workspace has a different operating model to other flexible office providers.Workspace has 100% ownership of its
buildings, while many other flexible space players lease from traditional office landlords and then sub-lease to tenants.
Therefore, Workspace benefits from properties' asset values and is not exposed to lease duration mismatch.
In the event of a no-deal Brexit, we expect London office prices to fall by 10% or more over the next 24 months. In our
no-deal Brexit scenario, the U.K. would experience a moderate recession lasting four to five quarters, with GDP
contracting by a cumulative 2.7% over two years, and London office prices falling by 10% or more. We believe that
Brexit will give many companies, especially financial services that are already under pressure to contain costs, more
reason to consider reducing office space in London.
Workspace has a moderate redevelopment/refurbishment pipeline that will bring a large amount of additional space to
the portfolio. The new and upgraded space, to be added over the next few years, will help drive rental income growth.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our view that Workspace should continue to benefit from the rising interest in the
flexible office market, and generate growing rental income and stable occupancy levels, supported by its good
quality portfolio in London. Under our base-case scenario, we forecast overall revenue to increase by around
10%-12% annually in the coming years due to completed refurbishment works, and annual 3% like-for-like rental
income growth. We forecast its debt-to-debt plus equity ratio will remain below 30%, EBITDA interest coverage
will remain around 4x, and debt to EBITDA at about 7x.

Downside scenario
We could lower the rating if Workspace's EBITDA interest coverage ratio decreased to lower than 3.8x for a
prolonged period, or if its S&P Global Ratings-adjusted debt-to-debt plus equity ratio were to increase above 35%.
We believe this could occur if the company were to experience weak operating performance such as increasing
vacancies or negative/flat rental income growth, or a sharp fall in its independently-appraised asset valuations. It
could also result from greater cash flow volatility or a more aggressive M&A policy than observed until now, as the
company seeks to expand its asset base.
We would also view negatively any signal that Workspace's offering had become more risky, for example if the
retention rate was falling or the average tenant stay decreased substantially. This would imply additional risks
compared with traditional office landlords and could negatively affect the rating.

Upside scenario
We consider an upgrade unlikely at this stage. We could, however, raise the rating if Workspace were to materially
expand the scale and diversity of its business, and also increase the proportion of longer-term leases. Overall, the
risks related to shorter-term leases and the size and diversity of the company's asset portfolio currently limit rating
upside potential, in our view.

• Stable occupancy rates in the like-for-like portfolio
of 90%. Occupancy will increase rapidly in the
refurbished or redeveloped units once those projects
are completed.
• £100 million of acquisition a year for modelling
purposes. We believe Workspace plans to keep
expanding its portfolio, but we acknowledge that the
actual acquisitions may differ materially from our
assumptions.
• Capex of around £75 million-£100 million a year due
to ongoing and future refurbishment projects.
• Fall in property valuation of 2% over the next 12 to
24 months and flat growth for future years, due to
the impact of Brexit uncertainties on the market.
• Stable dividend policy, consistent with the
company's REIT status.

Company Description
Workspace is a U.K. office real estate investment trust (REIT) that provides short-term flexible leases on its properties,
located across London. The portfolio was valued at about £2.6 billion as of March 31, 2019 and comprises 66
properties.
The company is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
Workspace is a leading flexible office property owner that operates solely in the London market. Workspace structures
most of its leases as two years long, with a six-month rolling break clause, and offers a limited number of rent-free
periods or incentives on larger lettings. Its tenants are predominantly small-to-midsize enterprises (10-50 employees)
and Workspace believes that these tenants are increasingly demanding greater flexibility from landlords to suit their

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 10, 2019 4

Workspace Group PLC

needs. Workspace benefits from bringing rents to market value every two years.
We consider that Workspace's operating model differs from other flexible office providers such as WeWork Companies
Inc. (B/Stable/--) or IWG PLC. Specifically, Workspace has 100% ownership of its buildings, as recognized through its
REIT status, while WeWork and IWG lease their spaces from office owners and then sublease to tenants; this exposes
them to duration risk mismatch between the leases. Additionally, Workspace is similar to traditional landlords because
it offers unfurnished space and charges by the square foot, while WeWork and IWG offer serviced furnished offices and
typically charge by the desk. Therefore, we consider that Workspace has a more secure operating model and view it as
more aligned with the more traditional office landlords we rate investment grade.
That said, there are some unique risks that we have factored into our business risk profile analysis. Workspace's lease
maturity profile is particularly short given the two-year length and six-month notice period. This heightens the risk of
vacancies increasing during a macroeconomic downturn, compared with a more traditional office property company,
which would typically secure leases for five to 10 years. However, Workspace's occupancy level has remained fairly
robust--even at the peak of the 2008/2009 financial crisis, occupancy levels fell by only 5%-6%, to 84%. We note that
Workspace already operates at an occupancy level of around 92%, which is low for the London market (JLL estimates
that the average occupancy rate in the London office market is currently 95%). Given its business model, the
company's structural long-term target vacancy rate is about 10%. This allows it to offer a diverse range of space to
tenants, especially on lease renewal, and to increase rents to market levels quicker than peers. This model has been
supported by the current high demand for the type of assets Workspace offers; the company's pricing strategy may
also adjust accordingly during a downturn. We view positively Workspace's track record on tenant retention. Most
tenants stay with the company for much longer than the standard two-year lease--closer to four-to-six years--and the
company is currently achieving around a 70% retention rate.

Although we factor in the company's limited diversity, given that it operates only in the London office market, this is
not unique among real estate players. Office players in particular are often concentrated in one domestic market or
even one large city. Partially offsetting this concentration is the size and liquidity of the London office market.
London's flexible office market has also experienced notable growth and increased interest, led by high profile global
players such as WeWork, over the past few years. Savills estimates that flexible office providers took up about 15% of
central London office space in 2018. London is one of the few global cities where the flexible office market is already
relatively mature and Workspace, as one of the leading and oldest players in this market, should continue to benefit
provided the environment remains positive. That said, many traditional landlords are testing this market segment by
offering more flexible leases, albeit on a smaller scale. This could change the competitive landscape in the future.
Workspace has a good-quality asset portfolio spread across London, mostly in prime locations, with a focus on central
locations in zones 1 and 2, and an area that is sometimes referred as the Tech Belt. We view Workspace's portfolio as
reasonably comparable in terms of location to that of Derwent London. Due to the nature of Workspace's lease
structure, it has been able to enjoy positive like-for-like rental growth over the past few years, even with Brexit
uncertainty hanging over the market. Although Workspace's tenants are smaller in size and perhaps lower in quality
than we usually see for a longer-tenor office landlord, its multi-let model enables it to enjoy the benefits of high tenant
diversity. Its tenants come from a wide range of sectors and it has only a small exposure to finance, which we view as

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 10, 2019 6

Workspace Group PLC

a positive in light of Brexit. It has no concentration to any single tenant; its top 10 tenants combined provide about
10% rental income, which is far more diverse than most office peers we rate.

Financial Risk: Modest
Workspace's financial risk profile is underpinned by the company's prudent balance sheet and commitment to
maintaining an LTV ratio below 30%. We also note positively its robust unsecured capital structure, with no material
debt maturities until 2022. We believe that there is high likelihood that the company will maintain its EBITDA interest
coverage ratio close to 4x over the next two years, supported by growing rental increases, EBITDA growth, and recent
refinancing activities that have lowered the company's cost of debt. Workspace now has a cost of debt of 3.7% in the
year to March 2019, compared to 4.3% for the 12 months before. The company enjoys a healthy balance sheet and
reported resilient cash flow, even in difficult years. We expect S&P Global Ratings-adjusted ratio of
debt-to-debt-plus-equity to be 25%-30% in next few years, which is at the stronger end of what we typically observe
for our European real estate peer group.
Our assessment of Workspace's financial risk profile also factors in the relatively small EBITDA base of the company
and its large capex, which we will continue to monitor. The portfolio has been growing over the past few years due to
this capex as Workspace has expanded its business as interest in the flexible office market has increased. We expect
this to continue into the future. We also see as positive the company's lack of large speculative
development--Workspace only carries out refurbishment projects that represent a maximum of 10% of the gross asset
value. We think these refurbishment projects are crucial to bring the Workspace buildings in line with its flexible office
offering by adding or upgrading space. They also allow the company to increase rents by offering modern vacant
spaces to tenants.

Liquidity: Adequate
We assess Workspace's liquidity as adequate. We anticipate that liquidity sources will likely cover uses by about 1.4x
to 1.6x in the 12 months from June 30, 2019.
Our assessment is supported by Workspace's minimal debt maturities in the coming 12 months, and the large partly
undrawn £250 million revolving credit facility (RCF). That said, the company's limited track record in the debt capital
markets constrains our assessment to adequate at this stage.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

We estimate principal liquidity sources for the 12
months from June 30, 2019, as follows:

This compares with the following principal liquidity
uses for the same period:

• Unrestricted cash and liquid investments of around
£15 million as of June 30, 2019.

• About £80 million of forecast capex for maintenance
and development.

• Our forecast of an estimated £85 million of cash
funds from operations under our base-case credit
scenario.

• About £60 million of dividend payments.

• About £120 million undrawn portion of the RCF,
maturing in more than 12 months.

Other Credit Considerations
Despite Workspace's long track record and good positioning in the rising flexible office market, our overall assessment
reflects our view that it is less well positioned compared with bigger office peers in the U.K. and Europe, such as
Derwent London and Societe Fonciere Lyonnaise. Its lease maturity profile is much shorter than we typically see--45%
of Workspace's rent roll expires within the first year--and we consider that this could lead to increased cash flow
volatility. Additionally, Workspace's EBITDA interest coverage is at the lower end compared with other
investment-grade rated peers that have a similar financial risk profile assessment (for instance, Global Switch or
Prologis European Logistic Fund). Therefore, we modify the 'bbb+' anchor downward by one notch to reflect our
comparable ratings assessment.
