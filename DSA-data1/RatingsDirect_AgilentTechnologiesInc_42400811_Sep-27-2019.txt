Overview
Key strengths

Key risks

Top three positions within most of its end markets

Smaller scale compared with other industry
competitors that have stronger business risk
profiles

Well-diversified end markets that include pharmaceuticals, academia, chemical/energy,
food, environment, and diagnostics, but moderate exposure to volatile industries, such as oil
and gas

Lower recurring revenue compared with the
industry as a whole

Diverse product and services base, minimal customer concentration, and a diverse
geographic footprint

Agilent Technologies Inc. maintains its stable and entrenched position as a midsize player in the life science industry,
with market-leading positions in all of its end markets. Despite revenue of about $5 billion for fiscal 2018, Agilent lacks
the scale of significantly larger competitors such as Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. ($25 billion of revenue in 2018) and
Danaher Corp. ($20 billion of revenue in 2018). However, the company has leading market positions in all of its end
markets. Within the life sciences and applied markets segment, Agilent has the largest position in the
environmental/forensics and chemical/energy end markets and the second-largest position in food safety testing and
pharmaceutical/biotechnology. Within the clinical diagnostics segment, Agilent has the second-largest position in
anatomic pathology. In addition, Agilent is increasing its focus on niche diagnostics markets, which continue to grow
in the high-single-digit area, ahead of the company's other end markets and faster than the life sciences industry in
general.
We expect stable organic growth despite some weakness in the life sciences and applied markets business. This segment
is exposed to intense competition from larger peers and is growing at a slower pace, in line with said competitors.
However, we believe Agilent benefits from strong pricing power in its diagnostics and genomics and Crosslab
segments, contributing to our overall expectation for stable organic growth. In addition, we expect mergers and
acquisitions (M&A) within high-growth areas, such as sequencing and diagnostics, to supplement organic growth.
We expect the company to sustain its current leverage profile of less than 1.5x despite its M&A appetite. Adjusted
leverage will increase materially to about 1.2x following the close of the recently announced acquisition of BioTek
Instruments for $1.17 billion. We believe the company's M&A capacity within the current rating is now about $1.7
billion over the next 12 months, excluding acquired EBITDA.

Outlook: Stable

The stable rating outlook on Agilent Technologies Inc. reflects S&P Global Ratings' expectation that the company's
revenue will grow 3.7% in 2019, which will enable the company to maintain its leading position in key end markets
and generate continued strong free cash flow. The stable outlook also reflects our expectation that the company's
financial policy will remain conservative and leverage will remain below 1.5x.

Downside scenario
A lower rating is possible if leverage meaningfully exceeds 2x and we expect leverage to remain at that high level
for more than one year. The current rating provides cushion for operational weakness that could result from
competitive pressures or customers' budgetary constraints. Therefore, a lower rating would more likely result from
an unexpected, debt-financed share repurchase or a large debt-financed acquisition that deviates from our view of
the company's conservative financial policy. A share repurchase or acquisition of more than $1.7 billion could
contribute to a lower rating.

Upside scenario
We could raise the rating if Agilent improved its scale and diversity (which in our view would strengthen its
competitive position) while maintaining the same amount of financial leverage. However, we believe this scenario
is unlikely over the next few years because the improvement in scale and diversity would likely be achieved
through a transformative acquisition resulting in meaningfully higher leverage.

Agilent Technologies Inc.

Assumptions

• We project Agilent's reported revenue will grow
organically at about 3.7% for fiscal 2019, in line with
our expectation for the life science industry. We
expect growth to be aided by strong demand in its
CrossLab and diagnostics and genomics segments
(particularly in the pathology-related and nucleic
acid businesses), offset by weaker demand
(stemming from intense competition) in its life
sciences and applied market segment.

• We expect stable margins in 2019, with operational
efficiencies and an increasing revenue contribution
from the company's higher-margin CrossLab
segment offset by increased wages and higher
acquisition- and integration-related costs.
• Annual capital spending of about $165 million to
$175 million.
• We believe that the company will deploy most of the
internally generated free cash flows (of about $800
million to $850 million) toward M&A, dividends, and
share buybacks.
• Based on the above assumptions, we expect
leverage will be sustained at about 1x over the next
two years.

Company Description
Agilent Technologies Inc. is a life sciences company providing laboratory workflow solutions, including instruments,
software, services, and consumables, to the life sciences, diagnostics, and applied chemicals markets. The company
operates through the following three business segments:
• Life sciences and applied markets group: Instruments and software that enable customers to identify, quantify, and
analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products by interrogating samples at the molecular
and cellular level.
• Diagnostics and genomics group: Provides active pharmaceutical ingredients for oligo-based therapeutics as well as
solutions, which enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the
cellular and molecular level.
• Agilent CrossLab group: Spans the entire laboratory with an extensive consumables and services portfolio, the
majority of which is vendor neutral, meaning Agilent can serve and supply customers regardless of their instrument
purchase choices.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
Our assessment of Agilent's business risk reflects the company's entrenched position in several diverse end markets, its
long-standing customer relationships, a history of successful product introductions, a broad product and services
portfolio, and a broad geographic footprint. These strengths are partially offset by Agilent's moderate exposure to the
more volatile oil and gas industry, its relatively low percentage of recurring revenues compared with peers, and the
company's medium scale compared with larger competitors such as Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and Danaher Corp.
Those companies have stronger business risk profiles, are more diversified, and have greater financial resources.
Despite intense competition from the larger peers, Agilent's strong position as a laboratory workflow solutions
provider in all of its key markets distinguishes the company from its competitors. In addition, Agilent is increasing its
focus on clinical diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, anatomic pathology, and molecular diagnostics niches.
We expect these niche diagnostics markets to continue growing in the high-single-digit area, ahead of the company's
other end markets and faster than the life sciences industry in general. While Agilent competes in clinical diagnostics
with large peers like Illumina Inc., Roche Holding AG, and Abbott Laboratories, we think the company benefits from a
broader product portfolio.
Agilent's recurring revenues from consumables and services account for about 55% of the company's revenue,
compared with the industry average of between 65% and 85%. However, we don't view this as a significant
disadvantage because we recognize that Agilent's lower consumables ratio comes from the company's higher
end-market diversity and historically lower focus on diagnostics.

Peers like Thermo Fisher, PerkinElmer, and Illumina are all life science companies with leading market positions
within their respective niches. Agilent sits in the middle level of the industry, where peers like Illumina only have one
niche end-market while larger players like Thermo Fisher have many end-markets.

SEPTEMBER 5, 2019 6

Agilent Technologies Inc.

Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. is nearly five times Agilent's size, has greater diversity, and has a vast distribution
network that has more scope compared with Agilent's. Moreover, its volatility is lower due to its presence in different
businesses. However, Thermo Fisher is rated the same as Agilent due to Thermo's much higher leverage, in the range
of 3x to 4x, and more aggressive financial policy.
PerkinElmer is half the size of Agilent, but has similarly diversified end markets, occupies top three positions within
most of them, and has moderate exposure to some more volatile industries. The difference in rating is due to
PerkinElmer's more aggressive financial policy, with our expectation that leverage will be maintained in the range of 2x
to 3x.
Illumina Inc. has narrower operating focus in genome sequencing. Despite its moderate scale and leading position, its
lack of product and business diversity contributes to a rating that is one-notch lower.

Financial Risk: Minimal
Our assessment of Agilent's financial risk reflects our expectation that leverage will remain below 1.5x and free
operating cash flow to total adjusted debt will remain in excess of 50% over the next two years. Our assessment of the
company's financial risk also incorporates our belief that Agilent will continue making acquisitions to support its
growth strategy. We also project Agilent will use most of its free cash flow generation toward dividends and share
buybacks. We expect the shareholder returns to be funded with a combination of debt and internally generated cash
flow such that leverage remains at about 1x.

Liquidity: Exceptional
We continue to assess liquidity as exceptional. We expect sources of liquidity to significantly exceed uses and that
sources would exceed uses even if forecast EBITDA declined by 50%.
Our assessment of Agilent's liquidity profile also reflects our view that the company has well established and solid
relationships with banks and high standing in the credit markets, given its diverse capital structure. In addition,
Agilent's ample cash balance supports our view that the company's risk management practices are very prudent. We
also think Agilent would be able to absorb a high-impact, low-probability event without the need for refinancing, given
the company's solid cash flow generation and a sizable cash balance.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Cash balance of about $2.1 billion as of April 30,
2019;

• Working capital outflows of about $100 million
annually,

• Full availability of $1 billion under the revolver as of
April 30, 2019; and

• Capital expenditures of $165 million to $175 million
per year, and

• Cash funds from operations generation of about $1
billion over the next 12 months.

• Dividends about $200 million to $210 million per
year.

Covenant Analysis
The covenant allows a maximum ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated total capitalization of 65%. Agilent
was in full compliance with this covenant as of April 30, 2019, and we expect it to maintain at least 30% headroom.

Issue Ratings--Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
Agilent's capital structure consists of unsecured obligations, with $1.7 billion of senior unsecured notes and a $1 billion
revolving credit facility.

Analytical conclusions
We consider companies such as Agilent, with a financial risk profile assessment of minimal, to have leverage that is
low enough to limit the possibility of any lenders being more significantly disadvantaged than others. Therefore, we
rate the long-term debt issued by Agilent 'BBB+', the same as the issuer credit rating.
