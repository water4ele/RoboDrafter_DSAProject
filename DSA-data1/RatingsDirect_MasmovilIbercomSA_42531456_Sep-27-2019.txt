Masmovil Ibercom S.A. has emerged as the fourth-largest Spanish
convergent telecommunications group.

aggressive moves from competitors.

fiber-to-the-home network, also resulting in an adjusted leverage of more
than 4x.

Masmovil has emerged as Spain's fourth largest national and converged operator. Masmovil Ibercom S.A. has
transformed from a very small mobile virtual network operator, with revenue of €130 million in 2015, to a converged
fixed and mobile network operator (MNO) generating revenue of €1.45 billion in 2018. As of Dec. 31, 2018, the
company reached 14% mobile and 7% fixed residential market shares in Spain, mainly through acquisitions and
expansion. After two years of net customer additions--the company is No. 2 in Spain for mobile customer additions,
behind Telefonica S.A., and No. 1 in the fixed segment--we expect Masmovil to continue increasing its subscriber base
organically, translating into sustained annual revenue growth of 10%-15% in 2019.

We expect Masmovil will continue leveraging on its flexible hybrid network strategy to grow profitably. We believe
Masmovil's capacity to secure and optimize its network access, through a flexible approach of a hybrid owned and
leased network, will support growth as the company expands in Spain and is able to offer its convergent plans to a
large number of potential subscribers. At the same time, we believe this strategy helps the group optimize its cost and
capital expenditure (capex) structure by rolling out its network in more profitable areas, while renting third-party
networks where returns are lower.
• As of June 30, 2019 Masmovil's fiber footprint consisted of 19.8 million building units (BUs)--of Spain's roughly 25
million business units--a 54% year-on-year increase. About 40% of these business units are owned or have been
co-developed, with the rest being indirect bitstream access.
• We believe Masmovil constantly implements an active and flexible network management policy, aiming at
optimizing its return on investment and the monetization of its network access. For instance, in May 2019, the
company announced it had reached an agreement with an international infrastructure fund for the sale of 933,000
fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) BUs for €217.5 million. At the same time, Masmovil agreed to acquire from Orange Spain
the indefeasible right of use (IRU) for one million BUs for a total consideration of about €70 million. The two
agreements generated about €150 million of net proceeds without affecting Masmovil's footprint, clients, and
profitability.

On the mobile side, Masmovil covers about 85% of the Spanish population with its own 4G infrastructure. The
company's population coverage reaches 98% through site-sharing and data transmission agreements, and three
national roaming agreements signed with Orange S.A., Vodafone Group PLC, and Telefonica.
The company's multibrand strategy, and service quality will support growth.Masmovil's multibrand strategy and its
focus on customer service quality and satisfaction supports subscriber and market share gains, while reducing the
customer churn rate. The group has implemented a multibrand strategy to target all segments of the Spanish
population. For instance, it has positioned Yoigo as an attractively priced premium brand, offering average discounts
of about 20% for its mobile-only and FTTH premium offering compared with Telefonica, Orange, and Vodafone. The
company also benefits from an attractive value-for-money proposition, with Pepephone offering packages that are
either slightly cheaper or have better terms than competitors. In addition, Masmovil differentiates itself by focusing on
service quality and customer experience. For example, the company benefits from enhanced digitalization, a
Spain-based client resolution service, and a fiber installation process that is convenient and transparent for the
customer, according to the company. This translates into stronger net promoter scores than the competition,
supporting ongoing subscriber additions and reducing customer losses.
Masmovil's moderate size, focus on the Spanish economy, and predominance of mobile-only operations expose the
group to potential aggressive moves from competitors.We believe Masmovil is more exposed to local market trends
and potential turbulence, both at the industry and the macroeconomic level, than peers'. Although competitors have
yet to react aggressively to the company's momentum, we believe that a sustained push toward lower prices from

Masmovil Ibercom S.A.

larger and better-capitalized peers, should they decide to protect their market shares at the expense of margins, would
be detrimental to Masmovil. This risk is emphasized by:
• The company's moderate size and focus on one economy. Unlike its Spanish rivals, Masmovil generates all its
revenue in its home country, so it cannot compensate for a potential decline in Spain with stronger performance
elsewhere; and
• The limited uptake in convergence. At year-end 2018, convergence accounted for about 22% of the group's total
mobile lines. Although we expect the contribution from bundled packages to increase, the majority of Masmovil's
subscribers are mobile-only, which tend to be less loyal than converged customers.
We therefore factor in our rating the risk that subscriber growth will not sufficiently exceed FTTH expansion capex
and rental costs from wholesale network access agreements, potentially resulting in weaker-than-expected profitability
and cash flows, as well as slower deleveraging profile for the group. Although Masmovil has met or exceeded its
guidance over the past two years while efficiently expanding its reach, organic growth prospects are not necessarily
certain.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our expectation that Masmovil will grow revenue by 10%-15% per year over the next
two years as it continues to add mobile, fixed, and converged subscribers and gains market share--especially in the
fixed segment--with slightly improving blended average revenue per user (ARPU). We also forecast the company's
EBITDA margin (S&P Global Ratings-adjusted) will reach about 30% by 2020, supported by the optimized cost and
capex structure under its hybrid network strategy. We therefore expect adjusted debt-to-EBITDA will decrease to
about 3.6x-3.7x in 2020, from 4.4x-4.5x in 2019 and free operating cash flow (FOCF)-to-debt will turn positive from
2020, accounting for close to 5% of adjusted debt.

Downside scenario
We could lower the rating if Masmovil failed to build significant market share, resulting in revenue growth in the
mid or low single digits, or if the group's adjusted profitability deteriorates. This could stem from a more aggressive
stance from the main Spanish telecom players seeking to protect their market shares. We would also lower our
rating should Masmovil's FOCF fail to turn positive in 2020 or adjusted debt-to-EBITDA remain materially above
4x.

Upside scenario
We could raise the rating if Masmovil continues increasing its fixed broadband and mobile market share at a high
pace, maintains its adjusted EBITDA margin close to 30%, and monetizes its FTTH network expansion capex. An
upgrade would require FOCF-to-debt to exceed 10%, with adjusted leverage decreasing sustainably below 3.5x.

Assumptions

• The Spanish telecom market will expand through
residential mobile and fixed broadband subscriber
growth, ongoing FTTH deployments and
conversions, and data monetization. We also believe
the price environment will become more favorable
after years of price wars, with Spanish operators
focusing on bundling and upselling to monetize
recent heavy network and acquisition-related
investments.
• Annual revenue growth will be significant, in line
with planned market share gains. For 2019, we
forecast annual revenue growth of about 15%,
slowing to 11% in 2020.

• Mobile activities will benefit from data monetization
and the uptake in convergence, which will partially
offset the corresponding slight ARPU decline.
• Increasing FTTH coverage and the ongoing
conversion of the fixed broadband subscriber base
to FTTH from asymmetric digital subscriber lines
(ADSL) will support moderate improvements in
blended fixed broadband ARPU and revenue.
• Adjusted EBITDA margin to increase to 28%-29% in
2019 and close to 30% in 2020, from 26.9% in 2018.
This will follow substantial revenue growth, better
absorption of the cost base, and declining
integration-related costs.
• Total net capex will decrease to 21%-22% in 2019
and 14%-15% in 2020 from 36% in 2018. This
correlates with Masmovil's plan to expand its total
portfolio of FTTH business units, either on its own
or through co-investments. We expect the new
business unit rollout will slow down as the network
gets deployed.
• Masmovil will receive, by the end of 2019, €217.5
million for the sale of 933,000 FTTH business units
to an international infrastructure funds. It also paid
€70 million for the acquisition of 1 million FTTH
BUs from Orange.
• It will also spend €30 million in additional
acquisition in 2019, including the acquisition of Hits
Mobile and of a minority stake in Cabonitel.
• The company will not pay dividends in 2019 and

2020 as it continues to invest in its expansion.
• In May 2019, the group borrowed €1.45 billion of
senior secured debt and issued €220 million of new
equity. These proceeds, along with cash on balance
sheet, refinanced existing senior and junior debt of
about €890 million, will repay convertible bonds
from Providence for a total amount of €894 million
(of which Masmovil repurchased €351 million in
May 2019, with the rest being paid off by December
2019), and covered about €44 million of transaction
fees.

Base-Case Projections
By 2020, we forecast Masmovil's FOCF will turn positive and adjusted leverage will fall to less than 4x. We forecast
continued and gradual EBITDA improvement as Masmovil expands its subscriber base and lowers its unitary cost.
National roaming costs per revenue-generating unit should decrease as the group adds subscribers, while subscriber
acquisition costs will weigh less on the overall cost structure as Masmovil gains market share.
At the same time, from 2020, we expect expansion capex will materially decrease as the company prioritizes
third-party access to cover the remaining Spanish population and territory.
Therefore, we expect FOCF will turn positive and adjusted leverage will fall to less than 4x from 2020.
We expect Masmovil will prioritize network-related capex and deleveraging over dividend payments over the medium
term. We forecast Masmovil will maintain its zero-dividend policy for at least the next two years as the group gives
priority to its network expansion program. The company's financial policy, consisting in reducing its reported net
leverage to less than 3x, supports this.

Company Description
Masmovil is Spain's fourth-largest telecom operator, providing fixed and mobile voice and internet services to business
and retail customers. The group generated revenue of €1.45 billion and served 7.8 million subscribers (4.8 million
mobile postpaid, 2.0 million mobile prepaid and 1.0 million fixed broadband customers) through its brands Yoigo,
Masmovil, Pepephone, Llamaya, and Lebara, as of Dec. 21, 2018.
Masmovil manages its own infrastructure comprising FTTH, ADSL, 3G, and 4G networks. Its 4G mobile network
covered 98.5% of the Spanish population, while its fixed network reached 18 million households with ADSL and
slightly more than 15 million with optical fiber at year-end 2018. Masmovil achieved this coverage after benefiting
from the regulatory remedies of the Orange-Jazztel deal, through acquisitions, by rolling out its own network, and via
agreements with other telecom operators or third-party infrastructure providers in Spain.
The group was founded in 1997 and has managed to grow rapidly through acquisitions, maintaining a sustained
expansion strategy. Masmovil acquired Pepephone and Yoigo in 2016, Llamaya in 2017, and Lebara in 2018.

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 25, 2019 10

Masmovil Ibercom S.A.

The group was listed on the Madrid Stock Exchange in March 2012 and 47.6% of its share capital is free float.
Onchena (family office), Willmington, Fidelity, and Providence are the largest individual shareholders with 14.3%,
8.7%, 6.9% and 3.3% ownership respectively.

Business Risk: Fair
Our assessment of Masmovil's business risk reflects the company's no. 4 market position, sustained net subscriber
additions, and market share gains. We believe the group's focus on brand segmentation and service quality will support
growth. In addition, Masmovil will benefit from its hybrid network strategy, optimizing its cost versus capex base,
while expanding its footprint through third-party agreements and the group's own rollout.
Balancing these strengths are Masmovil's moderate size, focus on one economy, and narrower product
portfolio--especially its nascent pay-TV offering--compared with that of fully convergent operators and competitors.
We believe this exposes the group to potential retaliation from incumbents. In addition, we factor in the risk that
subscriber base growth might not sufficiently match expansion capex and the group's semifixed-cost wholesale
agreements for network access.

Our business risk assessment for Masmovil is in the same category as that for eircom Holdings (Ireland) Ltd., DIGI
Communications N.V., Euskaltel S.A., and TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC.
Masmovil and DIGI Communications are both no. 4 player in mobile in their respective home markets, and they share
similar profitability and capex profiles. However, DIGI is No. 1 in fixed-broadband and Pay-TV in Romania and has
operations in Hungary, Spain, and Italy, while Masmovil remains focused on Spain.
In addition, Masmovil is less convergent and profitable than, and is not as dominant as, eircom in its domestic market.
However, we believe Masmovil compares favorably with:
• Euskaltel, whose business risk profile, despite its stronger profitability due to the predominance of fixed broadband
activities, is constrained by its lower scale and limited geographical scope; and
• Talktalk, which slightly larger scale only partly offset its lower profitability.

Financial Risk: Aggressive
Our view of Masmovil's financial risk reflects our expectation that debt-to-EBITDA (S&P Global Ratings-adjusted) will
decrease to about 3.6x in 2020 compared with 4.3x-4.4x in 2019, and that FOCF-to-debt will remain negative in 2019.
EBITDA growth will mainly support planned deleveraging, while we expect FOCF will turn positive from 2020 on
lower expansion capex as Masmovil finalizes the rollout of its own and co-developed FTTH network.

We view Masmovil's liquidity as adequate, based on our expectation that the ratio of liquidity sources to uses will
exceed 1.2x in the next 12 months from June 30, 2019, and would remain positive even if EBITDA were to decline by
15%. The company has ample headroom under its covenants, and good relationships with banks.

Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Cash and liquid investments of about €260 million
as of June 30, 2019

• Working capital outflows of €30 million-€35 million

• An undrawn €150 million revolving credit facility
(RCF) and €100 million capex facility, both maturing
in 2024
• €200 million to be drawn under the €1.45 billion
term loan B before year-end 2019

• Net capex of €320 million-€330 million
• €30 million allocated to acquisition purposes
• €543 million cash outflow corresponding to the
repurchase of the remaining Providence convertible
bond (tranche 2)

• Cash funds from operations of about €345 million
• Cash inflow of €217.5 million from the sale of
933,000 FTTH business units to an infrastructure
fund

Debt maturities
The €27 million senior unsecured bond issued by Masmovil will mature in 2020 and we expect the group will repay it
with cash on hand. The company will then have no maturities outstanding before the term loan B in 2026.

Covenant Analysis
Compliance Expectations
The documentation for the senior secured debt stipulates a springing net leverage maintenance covenant under the
RCF and capex facility, tested only if more than 40% of the combined RCF and capex facility is drawn. We foresee
adequate headroom, as this covenant is based on a 35% headroom from closing EBITDA.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

Masmovil is exposed to typical ESG risks for the telecom sector. We factor in the company's relatively
recent-but-growing awareness and commitment to addressing social and governance factors positively. In recent
years, Masmovil has indeed prioritized the formalization of a robust governance framework to accompany and
structure its rapid expansion. The company's policies to address social exposure favorably affect our view of its
customer relationships, leading to our operational forecast for more rapid growth and deleveraging, which
positively impacts the ratings. Being the no. 4 and most recently integrated telecom operator in Spain, Masmovil
has prioritized customer satisfaction and engagement with local communities, to differentiate itself from
competition, and increase its subscriber base (compensation for the executive team includes customer acquisition
and satisfaction targets). More recently, Masmovil has also ramped up its effort on data protection and
cybersecurity. The company adopted a cybersecurity and personal data protection policy at the board level, rolled
out a mandatory training plan for all its employees, and created a dedicated cybersecurity operations center to
prevent potential attacks. Finally, we believe Masmovil's decision to link the margin ratchet of its RCF and capex
facility to an ESG assessment illustrates the company's commitment to improving its sustainability.
At the same time, the company has yet to formalize other aspects of its sustainability strategy, such as how it
assesses ESG risks stemming from its contractors, management of e-waste, and the tracking and reporting of
environmental metrics on a more regular and consistent basis. We assess the telecommunications sector's
exposure to environmental risks as relatively low, but believe Masmovil lags some of its global peers in this
respect, which could present risks if not addressed.

Issue Ratings--Recovery Analysis
Key Analytical Factors
• We rate the senior secured term loan B borrowed by Masmovil Holdphone SAU 'BB-'.
• The recovery rating is '3', indicating our expectation of a meaningful recovery (rounded estimate: 60%) in an event
of a default.
• The recovery prospects are supported by our valuation of Masmovil as a going concern and the secured nature of
about 98% of the group's debt; they are constrained by the large amount of equal ranking and pari passu debt.
• We consider the security package limited: It comprises pledges over shares in the group's subsidiaries, intra-group
receivables, bank accounts and other agreed classes of assets, including pledges over the brands.
• Although the debt documentation offers the borrower operational flexibility, it provides creditors with only limited
protection, in our view. For example, we note the springing (40% drawn test) consolidated net leverage covenant
under the RCF and the capex facility, and a permitted indebtedness cap set at 4x the net consolidated leverage.
• Our hypothetical default scenario envisions a combination of increased competition between telecom providers,
weighing on the group's ARPU, combined with slower-than-expected subscriber growth, resulting in lower
profitability, and higher cash burn.
• We value Masmovil as a going concern because it is a midsize European telecom operator that is increasing its

market shares in both fixed broadband and mobile activities, while benefiting from well-defined brand positioning
and a proven hybrid network strategy.

Simulated Default Assumptions
• Year of default: 2023
• Jurisdiction: Spain
• Minimum capex (percentage of 2018 pro forma revenue): 6%
• Cyclicality adjustment factor: 0% (standard sector assumption for telecom and cable)
• Operational adjustment: 0%
• Emergence EBITDA after recovery adjustments: about €195 million
• Implied enterprise value multiple: 5.5x

Simplified Waterfall
• Gross recovery value: about €1.06 billion
• Net recovery value for waterfall after administrative expenses: about €1.01 billion
• Estimated senior secured debt claims: about €1.58 billion
• --Recovery expectation: 50%-70% (rounded estimate: 60%)
All debt amounts include six months of prepetition interest. RCF assumed 85% drawn. We round the estimated
recovery expectation down to the nearest 5%.

Adjusted

Our adjustment to reported debt in 2019 includes the addition of about €490 million of operating leases. These
comprise:
• The capitalization of the annual fee paid as part of the master service agreement (MSA) signed with Cellnex and the
minimum customer commitment on the 933,000 business units Masmovil sold to an infrastructure fund;
• €20 million-€25 million of financial leases; and
• Asset-retirement obligations of about €6 million.
We also add to the reported debt figure €135 million-€140 million of liabilities related to the wholesale long-term
agreements signed with operators to access FTTH networks and deduct cash on the balance sheet.
Our adjustments to EBITDA primarily include the addition of about €70 million corresponding to rent costs, the annual
fee paid as part of the MSA, and the minimum commitment under recently sold fixed infrastructure. We also exclude
about €10 million as part of share-based compensation expenses and €8 million of integration costs.
