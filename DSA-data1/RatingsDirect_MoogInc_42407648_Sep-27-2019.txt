Key Risks

Leading position in niche market of actuation components. Higher level of acquisitions and shareholder returns could result in higher leverage.

Long-term threat of Boeing entering actuation market.

Stable credit metrics.

We expect credit metrics to remain stable over the forecast period.
We expect Moog's earnings and free cash flow to improve in 2019 and 2020 over 2018, though 2019 cash flow will be
weaker than originally expected due to necessary investments in factories and supply chain processes to address
supplier quality issues. However, we expect Moog will offset this improvement with acquisitions and share
repurchases. Earnings improvement has come from a decrease in operating expenses, while cash flow improvement is
the result of higher earnings and lower pension contributions. In 2018, Moog used about $70 million to buy VUES Brno
s.r.o and smaller Electro-Optical Imaging. Management also initiated a quarterly dividend (about $36 million a year)
and completed about $94 million of share repurchases. We expect the company to continue to pursue acquisitions and
repurchase shares, which will likely result in funds from operations (FFO) to debt remaining 28%-32% in 2019 and
2020.

We believe the Boeing 737 MAX grounding will likely have only a modest impact on earnings.
While Boeing has lowered its production rate to 42 per month from 52, many of its suppliers have maintained at a rate
of 52 and are being paid by Boeing at that rate. The company only has modest content on the program (about $50,000
per shipset) and we expect deliveries of the MAX to resume in the next few months, so the impact on revenues and
earnings should be limited. If the grounding drags on much past our current forecast or Boeing cuts production further,
the impact could be larger, but still modest.

Boeing's entry into the actuation market could reduce Moog's market share in the long term.
Boeing has decided to bring certain actuation components back in-house and could limit how much is done by the
supply chain on future aircraft models. In 2017, Boeing invested in new facilities in the U.S. and U.K. to manufacture
actuation systems and components in-house. This could hurt Moog's strong position in actuation, and result in
weakened revenue and earnings, but will not likely have an impact in the near to medium term.

Moog Inc.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on Moog reflects our expectation that credit measures will be flat over the next 12 months as
the company benefits from higher earnings due to increased production rates and improved profitability over 2018,
offset by continued shareholder returns and additional acquisitions. This should result in FFO to debt of 28%-32%
in 2019 and 2020.

Downside scenario
We could lower the ratings if FFO to debt declines below 20% over the next 12 months. This would likely result
from a larger-than-expected acquisition or continued earnings pressure from the weaker industrial, space, and
energy markets, for example. Although less likely, this could also occur from debt-financed shareholder rewards,
for example.

Upside scenario
We could raise our rating on Moog if FFO to debt remains above 30% over the next 12 months and we believe it
would stay at or above this level even with acquisitions and shareholder returns. This would likely be due to the
company adopting a less aggressive financial policy, with all acquisitions and shareholder returns funded out of
free cash flow. Furthermore, we would expect earnings and cash flow to improve due to stronger demand from
growth programs such as the Airbus A350 and the F-35, and the benefits of cost-reduction and productivity efforts.

Company Description
Moog manufactures motion and fluid controls and systems for aerospace, defense, and industrial markets. The
company consists of three segments. Aircrafts controls manufactures flight control systems for commercial and
military aircraft, along with aftermarket services. Space and defense controls provides controls for satellites, space
vehicles, missiles, and other defense applications. Lastly, industrial systems manufactures different power generation
and metal forming components, along with various medical devices.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
Moog is a midsize supplier of manufactured components to aerospace, defense, industrial, and medical end markets. It
has a leading position in actuation components for aircraft. Boeing recently entered this market, which we believe
won't likely have a near-term impact but could be an issue in the future. Moog is fairly well diversified in the programs
it works on. The largest, providing actuations systems for the Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, accounts for
less than 5% of revenue. We expect the company's aircraft controls revenue to increase, with the F-35 program leading
the way as Lockheed ramps up production. We also expect the company's industrial systems segment to be relatively
flat as the company's exit from its wind-pitch control business in 2018 offsets growth from the VUES Brno s.r.o
acquisition. Lastly, we expect Moog's space and defense business to continue growing, driven by increased
government spending on missiles and launch vehicles.

Peer comparison
Moog is a midsize aerospace parts manufacturer with about $2.7 billion in 2018 revenue. The company does not have
any direct competitors in all the markets in which it operates, but is a peer to Hexcel, AAR, TransDigm, and Spirit
AeroSystems. It is similar in size to Hexcel and AAR, but smaller than TransDigm and Spirit AeroSystems. Moog has

better product diversity than all except TransDigm. It has similar margins to that of Spirit and AAR, while TransDigm
and Hexcel's margins are much stronger.

Financial Risk: Intermediate
Credit metrics remained relatively stable in 2018, despite weaker margins than in 2017, due to a lower amount of debt
and additional shareholder returns. We expect credit metrics to remain stable in 2019 as continued shareholder returns
and larger acquisitions offset earnings and free cash flow growth. We expect FFO to debt of 28%-32% in 2019 and
2020. Management stated that free cash flow would be weaker than originally expected in 2019 due to investments in
working capital and capital expenditure needs to drive future revenue growth.

Moog Inc.

Liquidity: Adequate
We assess Moog's liquidity as adequate, supported by cash on hand, availability of about $500 million under its $1.1
billion revolver, and positive cash flow generation. We expect sources of liquidity to be about 6.7x uses over the next
12 months and that sources would exceed uses even if EBITDA were to decline by 15%. However, we do not believe
the company would absorb a high-impact, low-probability event without refinancing, and we do not expect the
company to maintain this level of excess liquidity due to likely acquisitions that are not included in our liquidity
analysis due to their discretionary nature.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Cash of about $89 million as of June 30, 2019;

• Maintenance capital expenditures of $75 million
over the next 12 months;

• About $500 million of revolver availability as of June
30, 2019 after letters of credit and covenant
limitations; and
• Cash from operations ranging between $240 million
and $250 million for the next 12 months.

• Minimal debt maturities over the next several years;
and
• Annual dividend of $36 million.

Covenant Analysis
Compliance expectations
We expect the company to maintain about 30% cushion under the most restrictive covenant, the maximum net
leverage ratio, for at least the next 12 months.

Requirements
The company's revolver is subject to a maximum net leverage ratio of 3.5x and minimum interest coverage ratio of 3x.

Issue Ratings - Recovery Analysis
Key analytical factors
• Moog's capital structure consists of a $1.1 billion revolving credit facility due 2021, a $130 million accounts
receivable securitization program due 2020, and $300 million of senior notes due 2022.
• Default assumptions include LIBOR rising to 250 basis points and that the revolver is 85% drawn at default.

Simulated default assumptions
• Simulated year of default: 2024
• EBITDA at emergence: $162 million
• EBITDA multiple: 5.5x
