Key risks

Increasing recurring rental income from a growing portfolio of commercial
malls in China.

Execution risk associated with the evolving "asset-light" business
model.

Lower volatility in cash flow and leverage following ongoing business
transition.

High capital expenditure owing to ambitious expansion plan.

Adequate liquidity with a high cash balance.

Uncertainty around property development activities at Dalian
Wanda Group.

Accelerating transition to an asset-light business model provides long-term sustainability, despite some execution risk.
Dalian Wanda Commercial Management Group Co. Ltd.'s focus on rental income from 2020 following the winding
down of its property development business will lead to lower volatility in cash flow and leverage. The company is on
track to becoming a commercial property manager. This business typically has higher margins, stronger earnings
stability, and lower capital intensity than property development. We expect Wanda Commercial's leasing activities to
generate about 50% of EBITDA in 2019 and more than 90% of EBITDA in 2020. This is despite some execution risk
due to the company's still-evolving asset-light model in the mainland China.

Leverage to bulge over the next 12 months before reducing. We expect Wanda Commercial's financial leverage,
measured by the debt-to-EBITDA ratio, to deteriorate toward 5.0x in 2020, from 3.7x in 2018 and our estimate of
3.3x-3.7x for 2019. We anticipate the company will deleverage from 2021. The spike in leverage is because the decline
in EBITDA will outpace debt reduction amid contraction of property sales. Wanda Commercial's high capital
expenditure (capex) to support its ambitious target of opening 45-50 new malls per year over the next two to three
years puts additional pressure on its leverage. However, we believe the costs can be largely absorbed by internal cash
generation.

Resumption of property development at parent group could constrain Wanda Commercial's credit profile.The group is
resuming its property development business at Wanda Commercial's sister company, Wanda Properties Group Co.
Ltd. (unrated). Uncertainty around Wanda Properties' investment spending and growth trajectory could affect Dalian
Wanda Group's financial metrics, which could hurt Wanda Commercial's credit profile. However, we do not expect
Dalian Wanda Group to aggressively assume property development activities through Wanda Properties, given the
group's strategic focus on the commercial property management business through Wanda Commercial. We expect
Wanda Properties' investment spending, including land acquisitions, to be fairly disciplined and not raise the group's
overall leverage.

Outlook: Positive

The positive outlook reflects our view that Wanda Commercial will complete its business model transition with a
higher proportion of recurring cash inflow within the next 12 months. We also expect the company's rental income
to continue to have strong growth over the next two to three years. We anticipate that Wanda Commercial will
maintain a disciplined expansion plan such that its financial leverage and liquidity remain stable.

Downside scenario
We may revise the outlook to stable if Wanda Commercial's execution of its asset-light model is slower than we
anticipate, leading to capex and investments substantially above our forecast. An indication of this could be a
debt-to-EBITDA ratio of above 5x on a sustained basis, or EBITDA from leasing activities accounting for less than
two-thirds of total EBITDA.
We may revise the outlook to stable if Dalian Wanda Group's credit profile deteriorates, possibly due to aggressive
expansion into property development or weaker cash flow than we anticipate. A ratio of debt to EBITDA at the
group level of more than 5.5x on a sustained basis could indicate such weakness.
We may also revise the outlook if shareholders exert pressure on Wanda Commercial to provide
shareholder-friendly measures, such as large dividend payments or funding for property development projects,
which would materially affect the company's financial metrics.

Upside scenario
We may raise the rating if Wanda Commercial's rental income continues to grow, leading to positive free cash
flow, despite lower property sales. An indication of this could be the ratio of debt to EBITDA below 5.0x on a
sustained basis, and EBITDA from leasing activities accounting for more than two-third of total EBITDA.
The group credit profile of Dalian Wanda Group would also need to improve in tandem.

• China's GDP growth of 6.2% in 2019 and 2020.
• Wanda Commercial's property contracted sales of
about Chinese renminbi (RMB) 26 billion in 2019,
and no meaningful contracted sales from 2020. The
company's pace of contracted is more driven by its
transition away from property development rather
than sector conditions.

area per year, including through acquisitions of new
malls.
• Decline in overall revenue over 2019-2020 due to
depleting property sales revenue, mitigated by
growing rental income.
• Capex and acquisition investments of RMB14
billion-RMB20 billion annually over 2019-2021.
• Dividend payments of about RMB5.4 billion per
year.
• Accessible cash adjustment of 25% to reflect high
cash balance available for debt repayment and less
tied to use for property development.

Base-case projections
Margins to improve with higher proportion of rental income. We expect Wanda Commercial's EBITDA margin to
improve toward 60% in 2020-2021, from 38.8% in 2018, following the winding down of the lower-margin property
development business. We estimate that the margin will be about 43% during the transition in 2019. We believe the
company can sustain the enhanced profitability, given its record.

Company Description
Wanda Commercial invests in, develops, operates, manages, and leases commercial properties in China. It also owns
and manages self-branded hotels. The company offers its properties primarily under the Wanda Plaza brand. Wanda
Commercial has a property development business but has been winding it down in the past two years through asset
sales. The company expects to complete or sell off the remainder of its development projects by 2020. Formerly

known as Dalian Wanda Commercial Properties Co. Ltd., Wanda Commercial was founded in 1988 and is based in
Beijing, China.
Dalian Wanda Group Co. Ltd., which holds a 42.61% equity interest in Wanda Commercial, is a large Chinese
conglomerate with a diverse range of businesses. As of end-2018, the group was China's largest owner and operator of
shopping centers (through Wanda Commercial), one of the world's largest cinema operators, one of the world's largest
sports events, media and market platforms, and China's leading children's entertainment and education franchise.
The founder, Mr. Wang Jianlin, together with his family members, directly and indirectly holds 100% of Dalian Wanda
Group, and, in turn, 51.34% of Wanda Commercial. The second-largest shareholder of Wanda Commercial is an
investor consortium including Tencent Holdings Ltd., Sunac China Holdings Ltd., Suning.com Co. Ltd., and JD.com
Inc. The consortium holds a 14.4% equity interest in Wanda Commercial.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
Wanda Commercial's strong growth in rental income and focus on property investment and management support its
business standing. The company is the largest commercial property manager in China. It achieved more than RMB30
billion of rental income from commercial properties in 2018, up 23% from 2017. As of end-2018, the company has
about 28 million square meters of leasable gross floor area (GFA) through 280 Wanda Plazas spread across 165 cities
nationwide, with a high occupancy rate of more than 99%. This is in line with or better than that of international peers
such as Link Real Estate Investment Trust (Link REIT) and Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield SE. We expect the number of
Wanda Plazas to increase to more than 350 by 2020, covering all tier-one and tier-two cities in China.
We expect Wanda Commercial's rental income and EBITDA margin to continue to grow strongly, supported by new
malls in the pipeline, high occupancy rate, and the completion of its transition to a rental operator. The company is

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 10, 2019 7

Dalian Wanda Commercial Management Group Co. Ltd.

planning to open 45-50 new malls per year over the next two to three years. Two-thirds of new malls will be
"asset-light" where Wanda Commercial will act as a franchise partner and provide management services, with no
material capex. This business model, however, is still evolving in mainland China and is less mature than the
residential property development business. Long-term feasibility of the business remains to be tested.
Tenant stickiness is one of Wanda Commercial's key competitive advantages, in our opinion. The company's
diversified tenant base also underpins resilient rental income. Wanda Commercial derives 30% of total rental income
from top- and second-tier brands, including brands from its parent group, such as Wanda Cinema and Wanda
Department Store. Lease terms usually start from five years, with top- and second-tier brands typically signing leases
for up to 10 years.
These strengths are partly offset by Wanda Commercial's concentration in China, and execution risks associated with
the still-evolving asset-light business model. We anticipate the company will need to maintain high capex over the next
two to three years to support its mall expansion. It is also uncertain whether Wanda Commercial will need to return to
acquiring new land parcels for its new malls.
We do not expect the Dalian Wanda group to aggressively extract cash or financial support from Wanda Commercial.
In our view, the group has a strong incentive to preserve the financial strength of Wanda Commercial, given it is the
group's flagship subsidiary and largest income contributor. However, a weakening of the group credit profile of the
Dalian Wanda group, resulting from for example aggressive property development, could further constrain the rating
on Wanda Commercial.

We consider Link REIT and Hongkong Land Holdings Ltd. (HK Land) as Wanda Commercial's close peers for the
commercial property management segment, and China Resources Land Ltd. (CR Land) as a close property developer
peer.
Wanda Commercial's operating scale and diversity is much smaller than that of CR Land. Wanda Commercial's scale is
contracting following its transition away from property development. However, the company's rental portfolio is much
larger than CR Land's. The latter operates just 51 malls, with 94% occupancy. Wanda Commercial's rental income is
about 3x CR Land's and its geographic diversity is greater.
HK Land has better geographic diversity in international markets than Wanda Commercial and Link REIT. HK Land
has been increasing exposure to mainland China and Southeast Asia, from its key markets of Hong Kong and
Singapore. Link REIT has presence primarily in Hong Kong, although it's been conducting debt-funded expansion in
mainland China in recent years.
Wanda Commercial has a significantly larger rental income base and leasable GFA than HK Land and Link REIT.
Average occupancy rate of Wanda Commercial's malls is generally in line with these peers.
Link REIT has the highest EBITDA margin because it has major exposure to the more developed Hong Kong market.
Link REIT may also be more resilient in a severe economic downturn due to its focus on nondiscretionary spending.
Wanda Commercial's leverage is comparable to that of all peers, despite its greater growth appetite. The company's
gross debt has been decreasing in the past two years following the business model transition.

Financial Risk: Aggressive
Wanda Commercial's financial metrics will largely depend upon the company's ability to maintain its high occupancy
rate and good rental revisions, as well as success in becoming an asset-light property operator and manager. The
asset-light model will allow Wanda Commercial to act only as a franchise partner and provide management services,
with no material capex. By our forecast, 40%-50% of the company's new malls in 2019 will adopt this model.
Wanda Commercial will need to maintain high capex to support its expansion plan over the next two to three years
because a large portion of its new malls will remain under the asset-heavy model. However, we believe the company
will exercise financial prudence and balance capital spending with cash generation from rental income and
debt-funded expansion.
We expect Wanda Commercial's funding costs to moderately increase in the coming one to two years due to
tightening credit conditions. The funding costs were about 4.9% in 2018. The company's balanced capital structure
partly mitigates the risk of higher funding costs. As of Dec. 31, 2018, 47% of Wanda Commercial's reported debt
comprises working capital loans from banks, typically pledged by investment property assets with tenors up to 10
years. The cost is rather low, at 4.4%-6.9%.

Liquidity: Adequate
We assess Wanda Commercial's liquidity as adequate, given the company's high cash balance and manageable debt
maturities. We project the company's cash sources will exceed its cash uses by over 1.1x in 2019.
We do not assess liquidity to be stronger, given the company's ambitious appetite of adding 45-50 new malls per year
over the next two to three years. The new malls will require high capex. The portion of capital intensive malls could
also increase if Wanda Commercial fails to fully implement its asset-light model.
We view the company as having sound banking relationships, as shown by its ability to arrange and fulfill its agreed
repayment schedule with banks. With a high-quality investment property portfolio, Wanda Commercial has been able
to secure long-tenor bank facilities with all major onshore banks, including the four largest banks and 11 largest
commercial banks. Together, they have granted the company RMB360 billion in general bank lines as of end-2018, of
which RMB150 billion has not been utilized. In addition, the company has shown a reasonable ability to dispose of
overseas non-core assets to relieve its offshore liquidity pressure.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Unrestricted cash of RMB77.4 billion as of Dec. 31,
2018.

• Short-term debt of RMB22.6 billion as of Dec. 31,
2018.

• Cash funds from operations (FFO) of about RMB24
billion in 2019, comprising: (1) cash received from
attributable property sales, hotel rentals, rental
income, and other income of about RMB110 billion;
(2) construction costs of about RMB10.5 billion; (3)
interest expenses of about RMB9 billion; and (4)
selling, general and administrative expenses, taxes,
and others of about RMB67 billion.

• Capex and spending on acquisitions of about
RMB20 billion over the 12 months ending Dec. 31,
2019.
• Cash dividends that we estimate at RMB5.5 billion
for 2019.

• New onshore and offshore issuances of about RMB2
billion in January-March 2019.
