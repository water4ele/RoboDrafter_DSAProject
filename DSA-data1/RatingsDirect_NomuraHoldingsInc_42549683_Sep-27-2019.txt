Major Rating Factors
Strengths:

Weaknesses:

• Robust franchise and very strong position in Japan's
securities market
• Strong capitalization by international comparison
• Potential government support if needed, given its
high systemic importance to the country's financial
system

• Susceptibility of earnings to fluctuations in Japan's
securities market, leading to highly volatile earnings
• Market confidence-sensitive funding compared with
Japan's major commercial banks
• Limited room to improve profitability, because of
fierce competition in the domestic securities market

Outlook: Stable

Our rating outlooks on Japan-based securities firm Nomura Holdings Inc. (Nomura; BBB+/Stable/A-2) and its
core subsidiaries such as Nomura Securities Co. Ltd. (A-/Stable/A-2) are stable. They reflect S&P Global Ratings'
view that the Nomura group is likely to maintain its current position in the domestic securities market for the next
two years as it carries out a plan for an extensive business overhaul announced in April 2019. We also assume the
group's transformation of its business model will not lead to a substantial increase in risk appetite.
We could downgrade Nomura and its core subsidiaries if the group's efforts to restructure its business are
unsuccessful in a challenging market environment and we think its fundamental earnings capacity is likely to
remain weak. We would consider a downgrade also if its risk-adjusted capital (RAC) ratio declines and stays below
10%. This could occur if the group increases its risk appetite or pursues an aggressive capital policy.
Conversely, we could upgrade Nomura and its core subsidiaries if the Nomura group successfully transforms its
business model and builds a stable business. Specifically, we might upgrade the entities if the group maintains
strong capitalization and we see a sustained recovery in its profitability compared with that of its peers, such as
U.S.-based The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley.

Rationale
Our ratings on Nomura and its core subsidiaries, including Nomura Securities, reflect the Nomura group's continued
dominance of Japan's securities market. The ratings also reflect our view that its earnings are volatile owing to their
susceptibility to swings in global securities markets. We also think it has solid capital relative to the risks the group
assumes and view its business as more complex than those of commercial banks. We lift our group credit profile (GCP)
for the Nomura group two notches from its group standalone credit profile (SACP) to factor in a high likelihood of
extraordinary government support in the event of distress.

Anchor: The 'bbb+' anchor reflects our Banking Industry Country Risk Assessment (BICRA) for Japan
Our anchor for the Nomura group is 'bbb+', equivalent to our anchor for banks operating primarily in Japan. This
reflects our analytical approach to incorporate into our assessment of its risk position the complexity of the investment
banking business as well as the fact that the group operates its business globally. For a typical commercial bank or
nonbank financial institution, in contrast, we capture risk related to the entity by adjusting the anchor based on the
weighted average of the economic risk in relevant countries or regions.
We believe banks operating in Japan face low economic risks by global comparison. Japanese banks benefit from
operating in a large and diversified economy with various competitive industries. These strengths offset certain
structural weaknesses, such as Japan's aging society, low economic growth, and the government's limited fiscal
flexibility to stimulate the economy because of its debt level, which is one of the highest among developed countries.
Conversely, we view the industry risk Japanese banks face as relatively higher than that in countries with the same
BICRA score, because of the fragmented market and its low profitability. We believe that the current situation, in
which banks endure ongoing low profitability, poses a risk to the stability of Japan's banking system.

Business position: Relatively weak business stability despite a robust presence in Japan
The Nomura group's domestic securities business is likely to remain robust, although the stability of group's overall
business is likely to remain slightly weak. Its earnings are susceptible to fluctuations in global capital markets
compared with average domestic banks, as indicated by the BICRA. The group has an unfavorable earnings base
compared with global peers with material investment banking activities, and its earnings became more volatile in the
past five years. We factor these elements into our assessment of the group's business position.
We expect the Nomura group to maintain its dominant position and solid business in both the retail and institutional
securities markets in Japan. It holds the largest amount of retail client assets among its Japanese peers. As of the end
of March 2019, it held ¥115 trillion in retail client assets, primarily at Nomura Securities. The group's assets under
management, primarily at major Japanese asset manager Nomura Asset Management, totaled ¥51.4 trillion. Nomura
Securities has maintained the top ranking in Japan's equity league table for more than 10 years. It has long-standing,
favorable relationships with companies it provides underwriting services to as their lead manager. Its strong
distribution networks have further enhanced its market position in investment banking.
In our view, the Nomura group has a weak market position in overseas business relative to its dominant domestic
position. Also, its overseas business line and customer base are not as stable as those of global investment banks. In its
restructuring, the group aims to lower costs in its overseas operations and focus resources on competitive business
areas. This is because the group's overseas business has struggled to cover costs in a stable manner. Private banking,
asset management, and investment advisory businesses could counterbalance a relatively volatile institutional
securities business. But the group's asset management segment accounts for a limited proportion of the group's overall
net revenue at less than 10%.
Competition from major banking groups' securities affiliates and from large foreign investment banks is particularly
fierce in lucrative businesses, such as cross-border finance and merger and acquisition (M&A) advisory. The securities
arms of domestic banking groups benefit from their parent groups' strong ties with corporate customers, and large
foreign investment banks can take advantage of their strong global networks. Moreover, Japan's capital markets lack
diversity: Financing activity for emerging companies is a much smaller-size market in Japan than in the U.S.
Intensifying the competition further are the aging population and the rise of online brokerages. Revenue from retail

operations, which tends to be a face-to-face business, is likely to continue to decline.
Key issues that our credit analysis focuses on include whether the group's restructuring can build a stable revenue base
and whether it can restore customer trust. The group has been improving internal and management controls following
a business improvement order from Japan's Financial Securities Agency in May 2019. The financial watchdog issued
the order to Nomura Holdings and Nomura Securities in response to a case of improper communications.
We think the group's streamlining efforts overseas will lower its risk taking and reduce its operating costs to a degree.
Nevertheless, the group also faces challenges of carrying out business restructuring it announced in April 2019 amid
the harsh competitive environments it expects to face both in Japan and overseas continuously.

Capital and earnings: RAC ratio is volatile but likely to stay above 11%
The group's RAC ratio is likely to stay high by international comparison. We expect it to be in a range of 11%-12% in
the next two years. The ratio is highly volatile because the group's earnings and exposures are susceptible to
conditions in securities markets. We don't expect the group to conduct its business in a manner that would materially
increase its risk-weighted assets. Indeed, it has continued its strategies to flexibly allocate risk limits in accordance with
the market environment and to maintain strong capitalization. The group's capital quality is adequate, in our view.
Hybrid securities comprised 6.5% of its total adjusted capital (TAC) as of March 31, 2019.
We assess the Nomura group to have greater fluctuations in revenue than commercial banks. While its return on
equity (ROE) has stayed at about 8.0%-9.0% in recent years, it incurred net losses of more than ¥100 billion in fiscal
2018 (ended March 31, 2019), albeit due in part to one-time losses. The Nomura group may be able to mitigate
volatility in its operating performance if it achieves its target of ¥140 billion in cost reductions in three years through
fiscal 2021. Its credit quality might benefit if it builds a cost structure that generates sufficient revenue even in market
downturns and it establishes a business line with stable revenue. However, it would be difficult to determine whether
group revenue has become less volatile in just two to three years, in our view. This is because the volatility is rooted in
its business model.

Risk position: Growth in risk assets will likely remain under control while trading-related risk persists
Our assessment of the Nomura group's risk position incorporates the complexity of its businesses compared with
commercial banks. The group's earnings will remain exposed to considerable market volatility and counterparty risks,
in our view. This is because the group centers its earnings structure on its wholesale business. In addition, it has sizable
derivative and trading businesses, as well as a portfolio of strategically held equities. About half of the group's
risk-weighted assets under our RAC framework are exposed to market risk.
We think that in general the Nomura group appropriately manages risk in its trading business. It also reins in overall
growth of risk-weighted assets. It conducts global equity and fixed-income trading and underwriting mainly for
customers. Nevertheless, the group has a certain level of exposure to inventory and counter-position risks, where it
hedges dynamically most of the risks. It can't always hedge effectively, and the group could experience substantial
losses when market conditions change rapidly.
We think the group can generally manage risk associated with its considerable holdings of assets with low liquidity.
Among financial instruments categorized at level 2 and 3 according to Fair Value Measurements under U.S. GAAP,
residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) outstanding totaled about ¥2.8 trillion as of March 31, 2019. We
believe government-related financial institutions guarantee most of the RMBS. The outstanding balance of financial
instruments categorized at level 3 grossed about ¥426 billion in assets and about ¥177 billion in liabilities. These
amount to manageable respective levels of TAC of 17% and 7%. Some of Nomura's major assets outside its trading
accounts have low liquidity, such as investments in affiliates. However, we view them as manageable relative to its
capital.

Funding and liquidity: Adequate funding structure despite reliance on wholesale funding
The stability of the group's funding hinges on its creditworthiness and market conditions, in our view. This is because it
relies more heavily on wholesale funding than other core deposit-funded financial institutions do.
It prudently manages its funding and liquidity by conducting liquidity stress tests and planning for contingency
funding. We think the following characteristics of its funding structure largely mitigate risk in its heavy reliance on
wholesale funding:
• A matched funded balance sheet, with funding sources diversified by tenor and appropriate for each asset profile;
and
• An abundant liquidity portfolio of ¥4.9 trillion that mainly comprises cash, deposits, and government bonds, which
amounted to about double the unsecured short-term debt as of the end of fiscal 2018.
Unlike the majority of securities firms domiciled outside of Japan, the Nomura group has access to the central bank's
funding mechanism. This supports liquidity in times of market stress. In addition, the group is also able to access
European Central Bank financing through European subsidiary Nomura Bank (Luxembourg) S.A.

External support: High systemic importance in Japan
We lift our GCP for the Nomura group two notches from the SACP. This is because we believe the Nomura group has
a high likelihood of receiving extraordinary government support in Japan in the event of distress. We base this view on
our assessments of the group's high systemic importance in Japan's financial system and the government's tendency to
be highly supportive of private-sector banks.
The group has the highest market shares among Japanese securities firms in terms of customer assets and derivative
assets as well as a strong presence in global capital markets. Japan's Deposit Insurance Law allows the government to
inject public funds into a broader range of financial institutions, including securities firms' holding companies, if the
failure of these institutions threatens the stability of the financial system. Japan's Financial Services Agency designates
Nomura Holdings as a domestic systemically important bank (D-SIB).

Major subsidiaries
We assess four entities under the umbrella of Nomura Holdings as core subsidiaries of the Nomura group (see chart 3).
Therefore, we equalize our ratings on these subsidiaries with the GCP for the Nomura group based on our group rating
methodology.

We consider the Nomura group's equity-method affiliate Nomura Research Institute Ltd. (NRI) a moderately strategic
member of the group. However, NRI's creditworthiness is to some extent insulated from the creditworthiness of the
group, in our view.

To the extent that regulatory authorities allow a rating agency to acknowledge in one jurisdiction a rating issued in another jurisdiction for certain regulatory purposes, S&P
reserves the right to assign, withdraw or suspend such acknowledgment at any time and in its sole discretion. S&P Parties disclaim any duty whatsoever arising out of the
assignment, withdrawal or suspension of an acknowledgment as well as any liability for any damage alleged to have been suffered on account thereof.
S&P keeps certain activities of its business units separate from each other in order to preserve the independence and objectivity of their respective activities. As a result,
certain business units of S&P may have information that is not available to other S&P business units. S&P has established policies and procedures to maintain the
confidentiality of certain non-public information received in connection with each analytical process.
S&P may receive compensation for its ratings and certain analyses, normally from issuers or underwriters of securities or from obligors. S&P reserves the right to disseminate
its opinions and analyses. S&P's public ratings and analyses are made available on its Web sites, www.standardandpoors.com (free of charge), and www.ratingsdirect.com
