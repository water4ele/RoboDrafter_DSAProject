Overview
Key strengths

Key risks

Leading market position, offering a broad range of steel
products and services to diverse end markets.

Participation in the highly competitive steel processing market.

Low operating leverage stemming from a light asset base and a
flexible cost structure.

Some margin volatility as a result of generated steel scrap and inventory
holding gains/losses related to uncontracted volumes.

Stable distributions from joint ventures provide cash flow
visibility.

Credit metrics sensitive to the cyclical automotive and construction industries.

Balanced financial policies help maintaining relatively low debt
leverage levels.

Worthington's established market position and stable distributions from joint ventures mitigate some of its earnings
sensitivities. Despite some weakness in its end markets and lower steel prices, we expect the company to maintain
relatively healthy EBITDA levels thanks to its solid competitive position and stable contributions from its partnerships
totaling about $100 million per year (close to 30% of adjusted EBITDA). In our view, Worthington's low and flexible
cost structure as well as its demonstrated ability to integrate new businesses will remain the essential drivers of its
market position and cash flow generation.
Worthington's balanced capital allocation supports moderate debt to EBITDA in the 2x area. We expect Worthington
to maintain a balance between shareholder-friendly activities and debt such that leverage does not go much beyond
2x, which we view as commensurate with the rating. We believe the company will continue to manage its debt
leverage level through the cycle factoring in the volatility of its steel processing segment, which can result in large
working capital swings, and discretionary spending such as acquisitions and share repurchases.
Worthington remains exposed to significant competition and the cyclicality of its key end markets. The company
operates in a highly fragmented and competitive industry, especially in its steel processing segment (65% of total
sales). We view its exposure to the automotive industry (40% of total sales) and its sensitivity to prolonged or sudden
steel price declines as additional risks. We estimate that more weakness in end markets and metal prices that would
reduce Worthington's volumes and processing spreads each by 10% could result in debt to EBITDA increasing close to
3x.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects S&P Global Rating's view that Worthington Industries Inc. will maintain solid cash flow
generation amid slowing end-market conditions. While its margins could remain modestly lower than historic
averages, we expect the company to maintain a prudent financial policy such that adjusted debt to EBITDA
remains slightly above 2x and funds from operations (FFO) to debt stays close to 35% in the next 24 months.

Downside scenario
We could lower our ratings on Worthington if credit measures deteriorated from expected levels as a result of a
cyclical downturn that would pressure cash flow generation or if the company were to debt-finance significant
transactions such as mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and share repurchases. Specifically, we could lower the
ratings if adjusted debt to EBITDA exceeded 3x and FFO to debt fell below 30% on a sustained basis.

Upside scenario
Although unlikely, we could raise our ratings over the next two years if Worthington were able to meaningfully
improve its geographic and end-market diversity, operating breadth, and market penetration while maintaining
debt to EBITDA well below 2x and adjusted FFO to debt above 45%. This would likely be associated with a
commitment from management to sustain these metrics over the long term, along with a low likelihood of
large-scale, debt-financed acquisitions.

• Steel processing shipments to remain relatively flat
at about 3.7 million tons annually and pressure
cylinders volumes to modestly increase from fiscal
2019's level of 84 million units.
• Hot rolled coiled (HRC) steel prices of roughly $600
to $625 per ton for the rest of 2019 and in 2020.
• Pressure cylinders revenue growth to be offset by
lower steel processing prices in the next 12 months.
• Operating margin to modestly improve in fiscals
2020 and 2021 as a result of more stable steel prices
and scrap spreads as well as pressure cylinders price
increases.
• Joint venture distributions of about $100 million per
year, mainly from WAVE.
• WAVE and other joint ventures' debt to remain at
about $180 million.
• Working capital inflow of about $30 million in each
of fiscal 2020 and 2021.
• Capital expenditures of about $100 million in the
next 12 months and of about $80 million per year
thereafter.
• Dividends and share repurchases of roughly $50
million and $100 million per year, respectively.

Base-case projections
Revenue growth will be constrained by slowing end markets and lower steel prices. We forecast slowing automotive
and construction demand will continue to limit steel processing shipments in the next 12 months, while lower HRC
prices should weigh on Worthington's average selling prices. However, we forecast modest volume and price growth

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 5, 2019 4

Worthington Industries Inc.

on the pressure cylinders segment to mitigate some of this headwind.
Adjusted EBITDA margin will remain in the 10% range after facing some pressure in fiscal 2019. The prolonged
decline in HRC prices over the last 12 months and the wider scrap gap have weighed on Worthington's metal spreads
in fiscal 2019. We expect more stable steel prices and narrower scrap spreads to support less margin volatility in fiscal
2020, while the price increases implemented on pressure cylinders could contribute to modest margin growth. We also
forecast steady joint venture distributions of about $100 million per year (included in our EBITDA calculation) to
support adjusted margins.
Sustained free cash flow and prudent financial policy support debt leverage in the low 2x area.We estimate that
Worthington will continue to balance shareholder-friendly activities and potential acquisitions with debt leverage
considerations following weaker operating margin in fiscal 2019. While it might have less debt headroom than in the
past, we believe that the company will still generate about $200 million of free cash flow in the next two years to fund
its dividend as well as modest share repurchases and acquisitions.

Company Description
Publicly traded (NYSE: WOR) Worthington Industries Inc. is a metal processing company focused on value-added
steel and manufactured metal products. The company sells close to 4 million tons of processed steel (65% of fiscal
2019 sales) and manufactures filled and unfilled pressure cylinders (32%) as well as engineered cabs (3%).
Worthington primarily serves customers in the automotive, construction, leisure and recreation, energy, and other
industrial end markets. The company, which was founded in 1955, is headquartered in Columbus, Ohio.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
Worthington is a leading player in the fragmented steel processing market and one of the largest pressure cylinders
producers in the U.S. We believe this position stems from strategically located facilities (strong Midwest presence),
favorable lead times, and the broad range of value-added services and products it provides. The company serves
diverse end markets in its pressure cylinders segment and has strong relationships with the three Detroit automakers.
Worthington's relatively flexible and low-cost structure also strengthens its competitive position. A light asset base,
mostly nonunionized workforce, and sizable contracted sales (about 75% of steel processing volumes) result in a
smaller degree of operating leverage and more stable margins than some its metal processing peers.
Worthington's long track record of integrating new businesses provides additional competitive advantages and
earnings stability. The company notably receives about $100 million in distributions from specialized joint ventures,
with the Worthington Armstrong Venture (WAVE) being the largest and strongest cash flow contributor. In addition,
the partnerships (about 30% of Worthington's adjusted EBITDA) allow the company to enter new markets, such as
suspension ceiling systems, metal framing, and automotive stamping. We expect the higher value-added and growing
pressure cylinders business and WAVE to offset some margin weakness and volatility on its steel processing business.

Worthington's favorable market position is somewhat offset by a degree of concentration risk, competitive pressures,
and an exposure to sharp changes in metal prices. Transactional sales on its steel processing segment (about 25%) can
lead to inventory holding losses, while the generated scrap steel is exposed to pricing volatility. The company's
revenues are also primarily oriented toward the cyclical automotive and construction industries (about 60% and 12%
of steel processing), which can generate additional margin volatility through economic cycles.

We view Worthington as slightly different compared to a typical service center given the higher value-added nature of
its products, its pressure cylinders segment, and its meaningful joint ventures. This business mix and a higher degree of

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 5, 2019 7

Worthington Industries Inc.

contracted sales allow the company to generate stronger adjusted EBITDA margins than several of its steel processing
peers. We believe that, although it has a smaller scale than Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co., Worthington's leading
position in key markets, different business model, and favorable cost structure help its margin being in the same
favorable range of about 10%.
Due to its different business mix, Worthington is less working capital intensive than other service center companies,
resulting in lower cash flow variations through activity cycles. Over the past few years, the company turned over its
inventory almost twice as fast as its peers. We view Worthington's relatively low capital intensity and its balanced
financial policies as key to its moderate debt leverage and investment-grade rating.

Financial Risk: Intermediate
We expect Worthington will continue to produce moderate debt leverage in the low 2x area as it maintains relatively
conservative financial policies and steel prices stabilize. Weaker-than-expected earnings were the primary drivers of
adjusted debt to EBITDA increasing to 2.4x in fiscal 2019 (ended May 31) from 1.9x in the previous year. As operating
margins normalize and the company continues to generate free cash flow, we expect the company to maintain its
relatively stable debt leverage track record.
With HRC prices recently reaching lower levels below $600/t and end markets activity slowing down, we forecast the
company to benefit from some countercyclical working capital inflows of about $30 million, which should solidify free
cash flow generation of about $200 million annually. While relatively lower earnings could result in less capital
allocation headroom, we expect the company to maintain modest shareholder-friendly activities while balancing out
debt leverage considerations. For instance, we expect the recently announced refinancing transaction ($150 million of
2020 notes redeemed with a €92 million private placement) will take out $50 million of gross debt from its balance
sheet.
Our assessment continues to incorporate the sensitivities of Worthington's credit metrics to cyclical end markets and
operating margins. Although we forecast its metal spreads to remain relatively stable, a continuing weak steel price
trajectory, a wider scrap gap, or a cyclical downturn in the automotive and construction industries could pressure
existing levels. In this scenario, we estimate that a 10% decline in processing margins combined with a 10% decrease
in volumes would lead to adjusted debt to EBITDA being close to 3x.

Liquidity: Exceptional
We view Worthington's liquidity to be exceptional based on the following observations and estimates:
• An expectation that liquidity sources should exceed uses by at least 2x over the next two years;
• Positive liquidity sources minus uses, even if forecast EBITDA declines by an unanticipated 50%;
• Sufficient covenant headroom for forecast EBITDA to decline by 50% without the company breaching its financial
covenants; and
• Qualitative factors such as its high standing in credit markets as well as large cash balance and revolver availability
demonstrating prudent risk management.

Covenant Analysis
We do not anticipate any covenant issues for at least the next two years under our base-case forecast. Worthington's
revolving credit facility is subject to two financial covenants--a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.25x and a
maximum consolidated debt to capitalization ratio of 60%. As of May 31, 2019, the company was in compliance with
both of these covenants.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
• As of May 31, 2019, Worthington had approximately $750 million in total debt outstanding, which consisted of
unsecured debt at the parent level.
• The company's $500 million revolver (February 2023 maturity) had availability of about $500 million as of May 31,
2019, with senior unsecured notes of $150 million due 2024, $250 million due 2026, and $200 million due 2032.

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 5, 2019 10

Worthington Industries Inc.

• The company also has term loans and other debt of about $5 million related to foreign subsidiaries, as well as an
undrawn, recently amended $50 million revolving trade accounts receivable securitization facility maturing in
January 2020.
• We exclude Worthington's proportion of the total debt at its unconsolidated joint ventures (WAVE and others) from
our notching analysis since it is nonrecourse, contains no cross-default provisions, and we do not expect it to be
supported in a hypothetical default.

Analytical conclusions
Worthington's debt is rated 'BBB', the same as the issuer credit rating, since no significant elements of structural or
contractual subordination risks are present in the capital structure, in our view.
