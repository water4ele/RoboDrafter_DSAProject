Key Risks

One of the largest and most diversified petrochemical producers in Asia with
2.5 million tons per annum (mtpa) ethylene capacity.

Exposure to a highly cyclical global petrochemical industry.

High operational efficiency through an industry cycle and vertically
integrated petrochemical production processes.

Aggressive investment plans to drive up debt levels and leverage,
which leaves narrow buffer in current rating.

Diversified product mix, along with growing exposure into nonchemical
segments support cash flow stability

Large scale and record of high utilization rates support earnings stability. We expect LG Chem Ltd.'s stable earnings to
continue, considering its large capacity, diversified product offering, and track record of high levels of operating
efficiency. Thanks to its vast range of products with different end demand exposures, LG Chem's profitability has been
stable relative to its Asian peers, averaging 14% EBITDA margin over the past cycle, while being most resilient during
the recent downcycle.
Earnings from the energy solution to offset weaker profits from its traditional petrochemical business.We expect
earnings from the energy solutions division (EV batteries) to more than offset weaker earnings from petrochemicals to
result in 6% three-year operating profit compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for LG Chem. The tripling of its EV
battery capacity to 100 gigawatts (GW) by end-2020 will help the company to sustain stable earnings and operating
cash flows, and mitigate expected downcycle in the petrochemical industry over the next two years. From 9% in 2018,
we expect earnings from the energy solution to contribute 37% of total operating profit by 2021, while showing 68%
operating profit CAGR during the same period.
Steady investment and rising debt to reduce rating headroom. We expect LG Chem's leverage to increase as the
company engages in aggressive investments to expand EV battery and petrochemical plant capacities, while
maintaining its dividends policy. We estimate LG Chem's adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio to deteriorate to 1.5x–1.8x
over the next two years from 0.3x in 2017 and 1.0x in 2018, given a near tripling in annual spending versus historical
levels.

Chart 1

The company's earnings and cash flows remain exposed to the inherent volatilities of the petrochemical industry. In
2018, LG Chem's operating profit fell 23% to Korean won (KRW) 2.2 trillion primarily due to weakening petrochemical
spreads amid slowing demand, global capacity expansions, and oil price decline. We expect petrochemical earnings to
further decline over the next 12-24 months as sizable global capacity expansions continue to outpace demand, thereby
weakening the overall petrochemical spreads. We believe earnings growth from LG Chem's energy solutions business
will mitigate this factor for the next two to three years, but intensifying competition and risk of oversupply could result
in profitability uncertainty over the long term.

LG Chem Ltd.

Outlook: Negative

The negative outlook on LG Chem reflects our view that the company's heightened capex and rising debt have
narrowed the headroom for the rating over the next 24 months.

Downside scenario
We may lower the rating if LG Chem's ratio of debt to EBITDA stays above 1.5x on a sustained basis. Such a
scenario could result from consistently high debt-financed capex or a significant deterioration in operating cash
flows due to weaker petrochemical margins or slower ramp up of the batteries business.

Upside scenario
We may revise the outlook to stable if LG Chem's debt-to-EBITDA ratio remains below 1.5x on a sustained basis.
This could result from the company lowering capital investments, thereby enhancing flexibility in managing debt.
Stronger earnings growth stemming from better petrochemical margins and EV battery operations could also lead
to robust operating cash flows, resulting in reduced leverage.

battery sales. This compares with 9.7% revenue
growth in 2018.
• EBITDA margin of 11%-13% for 2019-2020,
compared with 13% in 2018.
• Capex to grow to about KRW6 trillion in 2019,
followed by KRW4.5 trillion–KRW5 trillion in 2020,
compared to KRW4.3 trillion in 2018 and KRW2.4
trillion in 2017.
• Annual dividends of KRW480 billion to KRW500
billion in 2019 and 2020.

Base-case projections
Earnings growth from energy solutions business to drive LG Chem's overall earnings from 2020.We expect a rapid
growth in the energy solutions business to drive the company's overall operations, offsetting weaker petrochemical
earnings over the next two years. Mainly due to the start of EV battery sales to European automakers (i.e.
Volkswagen), we expect three-year CAGR of 10% and 9% for LG Chem's overall revenue and EBITDA, respectively.
For the petrochemical sector, we believe peak-of-the-cycle levels of earnings are behind us, given that we expect
global supply growth to outpace demand.
Capex to remain elevated over the next 12-24 months on aggressive investment push. We expect LG Chem's capex to
be higher over the next two years at about KRW6 trillion and KRW4.5 trillion–KRW5.0 trillion, respectively.
Considering our estimate of about KRW3 trillion committed investments that include maintenance, LG Chem's total
capex of KRW6 trillion for 2019 reflects its aggressive investment plans to expand energy solutions and petrochemical
businesses.

Company Description
LG Chem is one of the largest petrochemical producers in Asia with an annual revenue of about KRW28 trillion (US$25
billion) and an annual naphtha cracking center (NCC) capacity of 2.5mtpa as of 2018. The company produces a wide

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 24, 2019 6

LG Chem Ltd.

range of upstream and downstream petrochemical products such as polyolefins, polyvinyl chloride (PVC)/plasticizers,
acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), acrylates/super absorbent polymer (SAP), and synthetic rubbers. It is also a
major producer of lithium-ion batteries (for mobile handsets, energy storage systems, and EVs), and materials for
display products (i.e. polarizer films).
The company operates in five major segments: Petrochemicals, energy solutions (batteries), advanced materials
(information and electronic materials, and engineering plastics), life sciences, and agricultural chemicals. The
petrochemicals division accounted for about 65% of sales and 95% of operating profit in 2018.
Chart 2

Business Risk: Satisfactory
We expect LG Chem to maintain its position as one of the leading petrochemical producers in Asia, with one of the
largest NCC capacities in the region with 2.5mtpa in terms of ethylene, and with the past track record of operating its
petrochemical plants near full utilization rate at more than 95%. LG Chem's petrochemical division offers a vast range
of products, which is comparable to four Formosa Group (Cayman) Ltd. companies' products combined. LG Chem's
key products include PE, PP, ABS, SBR, PVC, and SAP. These product spreads lack correlation, given different end

demand applications.
High operations rates and diversified product portfolio have supported LG Chem's profitability, as it has been most
stable relative to its Asian peers over the past eight years. Compared to its peers' EBITDA margin fluctuation of 12%
since 2011, LG Chem's range has only been 6.6%, while its EBITDA margin during the recent downcycle (2014) was
11%--compared with peers' average of 5%. Furthermore, LG Chem's average profitability has been the highest
amongst the peers during the same period at 14.0%, closely followed by Formosa Group companies' 13.6%. As we
expect a petrochemical downcycle to be underway over the next two years and for LG Chem's chemical earnings to
decline, we still believe these strengths will enable LG Chem's petrochemical earnings to remain relatively resilient
compared with peers. As such, we have reflected these factors in our positive comparable rating analysis.
Chart 3

We expect demand for EVs to rapidly increase over the next several years, driven by global initiatives to reduce
carbon emissions and lower dependency on crude oil as transportation fuel. Investments for EV batteries are therefore
likely to grow. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), 70 gigawatt hours (GWh) of battery cells were
produced for light duty vehicles (LDVs). Based on capacity expansion plans by major EV battery makers such as
Panasonic, CATL, SK Innovation, and LG Chem, production capacity could increase by 2.5 times to accommodate the
strong demand for electrification by 2023.

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 24, 2019 8

LG Chem Ltd.

For LG Chem, we expect the growing exposure into EV batteries to benefit the company in further diversifying into the
nonchemicals business and help offset earnings weakness from its petrochemical business, resulting in LG Chem
achieving 9% three-year EBITDA CAGR. From 35GW in 2018, LG Chem plans to nearly triple its EV battery capacity
to 100GW by end-2020. We expect sales and operating profit contribution to increase to 44% and 37% by 2021 from
2018's 23% and 9%, respectively.
In 2018, the energy solutions business achieved KRW6.5 trillion in sales (+43% annually), while operating profit grew
seven-fold to KRW209 billion (3.2% operating profit margins). Considering its total EV battery order backlog of
KRW110 trillion as of the first quarter of 2019, we expect energy solution to show exponential growth over the next
three years, in which we expect sales and operating profit CAGR of 37% and 68%, respectively, while maintaining
mid-single-digit operating profit margins.
As a result of rising dependency and earnings growth from the energy solutions business, we expect the volatility in
the company's overall earnings and operating cash flows to be further reduced, given that the company will become
less exposed to the volatile petrochemical cycle.
Chart 4

Despite these positive factors, we believe LG Chem's earnings and cash flows are still somewhat exposed to

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 24, 2019 9

LG Chem Ltd.

fluctuations in macroeconomic drivers and the volatility in the petrochemicals business. As witnessed in 2018,
profitability in the petrochemicals industry has come off from its peak in 2017, and could further weaken once planned
global capacity expansion in the sector comes on stream over the next 12-24 months. As a result, we expect operating
profits in the petrochemical operations to weaken further until 2020 after dropping 24% to KRW2.1 trillion in 2018. We
expect earnings growth from the energy solutions business to mitigate this factor for the time being.
Nevertheless, longer-term visibility of the EV battery sector may be uncertain due to the intensifying competition, risk
of oversupply, and changes in regulations/subsidies.

LG Chem Ltd.

We view Formosa Plastics Corp. (FPC; A-/Stable/--), PTT Global Chemical Public Co. Ltd. (PTTGC; BBB+/Stable/--),
SK Global Chemical Co. Ltd. (SKGC; BBB+?Negative/--), and Hanwha Total Petrochemical Co. Ltd. (HTC;
BBB/Stable/--) as comparable peers of LG Chem. All these companies operate in similar industries and have similar
product offerings.
We believe LG Chem's competitive position is most comparable to that of Taiwan's FPC. Similar to FPC, LG Chem
also has a vast range of products with a sizable market position in the region. Coupled with diversified asset
concentration, operating efficiencies have also shown a good track record of high utilization rates at 95% and limited
shutdowns for LG Chem.
PTTGC also has a dominant domestic market share with 60%-70% of revenues coming from Thailand. It benefits from
stable raw material sourcing from its refining arm and has a fairly diversified product mix. Nevertheless, we believe LG
Chem has more product diversity than PTTGC, given that PTTGC's dominant products--olefins/polyolefins--represent
about 70% of its revenue. For LG Chem, olefins/polyefins and ABS each represent about 30% of total chemical
revenue.
SKGC and HTC are also among the larger petrochemical companies in the domestic Korean markets. However, LG
Chem has better competitive position with greater size, asset diversity, and product diversification. This is evident on
their revenue scale, in which LG Chem's sales (US$25 billion) are about 2.5 times that of SKGC (US$11.7 billion) and
HTC (US$10 billion) as of 2018.
Amongst its peers, LG Chem's profitability has been most stable over the years, while maintaining the highest EBITDA
margin since 2011, closely followed by FPC.
Following the company's aggressive investment announcement for 2019 and beyond, we expect LG Chem's leverage
to be similar to that of its peers such as FPC and HTC. As of 2018, LG Chem's debt to EBITDA was lower than peers at
1.0x, while FPC was at 1.7x and HTC was at 1.4x. While we expect its peers to maintain their credit metrics, we expect
LG Chem's to worsen--given that we expect negative discretionary cash flows to persist on sizable investments,
resulting in debt to EBITDA of 1.5x–1.8x over the next two years.

Financial Risk: Modest
We expect LG Chem's aggressive investment plans to increase debt and weaken credit metrics over the next two
years. While the company's adjusted debt has always been less than, or equal to KRW2 trillion as the company's
investment plans were within its annual EBITDA, LG Chem has taken greater balance sheet risk by investing
substantially more than its earnings in recent years. This could indicate a shift in the company's financial policies and
significantly reduces ratings headroom versus previous years.
Following 2018's KRW4.3 trillion capex that was greater than its KRW2 trillion operating cash flows, LG Chem's
adjusted debt increased to KRW3.6 trillion from 2017's KRW1.1 trillion. Its average debt to EBITDA in 2018 increased
to 1.0x from an average of 0.5x between 2011 and 2018.
In 2019, LG Chem announced a sizable capital investment plan of KRW6 trillion, which in our view, will further

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 24, 2019 11

LG Chem Ltd.

weaken its capital structure and require substantial debt funding. Much of the investments will be used to increase EV
battery lines and to expand petrochemical capacity by 800 kilo tones per annum in Yeosu, Korea. Considering its
annual operating cash flows of KRW3.4 trillion–KRW4.0 trillion, we expect LG Chem to generate negative free cash
flows and discretionary cash flows over the next two years. We also forecast its adjusted debt to further grow to about
KRW6 trillion in 2019 and KRW7 trillion–KRW7.5 trillion in 2020.
We believe the company's aggressive investment plans and rising debt will weaken LG Chem's credit metrics, in which
we forecast debt to EBITDA to range 1.5x–1.8x over the next two years from 1.0x in 2018. EBITDA growth is
insufficient to stabilize credit metrics, given that we expect the pace of debt increase to outpace earnings growth. As a
result, we believe LG Chem's financial metrics may have narrow headroom to maintain the current ratings over the
next 24 months, hence our negative outlook on the company.

Liquidity: Adequate
We assess LG Chem's liquidity as adequate. We expect the company's ratio of liquidity sources to uses to be around
1.3x over the next 12 months ending March 31, 2020. We also expect sources to exceed uses even if EBITDA declines
15%.
We believe the company has good access to financial markets, as evidenced by frequent domestic bond issuances over
the past several years, as well as the recent global bond issuance of about US$1.6 billion, which was one the largest
issuances by a single private Korean firm. The company has good relations with major banks in Korea, as evidenced by
its funding with a vast range of domestic and global banks. We also believe the company has the ability to absorb
high-impact and low-probability events with limited need for refinancing, considering its cash holdings of KRW3.1

Environmental, Social, And Governance

Environmental and social factors are relevant to our analysis of LG Chem, given that the company faces long-term
risks such as tighter regulation and increased scrutiny due to its inherent exposure to greenhouse gas emissions,
pollution, waste generation, and toxicity.
LG Chem is making efforts to manage these risks by tracking key environmental metrics, improving efficiencies,
recycling waste, and reducing pollution in its manufacturing processes. The company has also set a goal to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions by 23% over the next two years, compared with business-as-usual levels. So far, LG
Chem has been reaching its annual targets and is on track to meet its long-term goal.
Long-term consumer behaviors such as awareness of chemicals and its related products are notable social risks to
petrochemical demand in general. LG Chem manages this by diversifying its product offering, which includes
high-value-added products. This provides some protection from changing patterns in consumer demand. Over the
past two decades, LG Chem has been investing in EV batteries. As a result, the company is one of the major EV
battery makers globally and plans to focus its business on renewable energy sources as consumer preference shifts
away from carbon fuel.
Overall, LG Chem maintains a satisfactory safety track record with no significant accidents in recent history. We
do not find any material deficiency in LG Chem's corporate governance. The company has adequate internal
controls in place and maintains independence from the board.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
We rate multiple senior unsecured debt instruments that LG Chem has issued. As of June 30, 2019, LG Chem's capital
structure consists of about KRW5.4 trillion of unsecured debt at the parent level and about KRW3.1 trillion of
unsecured debt issued by the company's subsidiaries, implying a priority debt ratio of 37%.

Analytical conclusions
We rate LG Chem's senior unsecured notes the same as our long-term issuer credit rating on the company. This is
because LG Chem has sufficiently low leverage, limiting the possibility of senior unsecured debtholders being
disadvantaged relative to other lenders, suggesting low subordination risk. In addition, we believe the risk of
subordination is mitigated by a material proportion of consolidated earnings and cash flows that the issuer directly
generates. As of December 2018, LG Chem's parent company generated 95% of consolidated operating cash flows.
