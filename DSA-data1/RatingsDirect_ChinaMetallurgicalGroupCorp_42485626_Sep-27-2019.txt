Strong market position and expertise in metallurgical construction support China Metallurgical Group Corp.'s (CMGC)
business growth. CMGC, via its key subsidiary, Metallurgical Corp. of China Ltd. (MCC), is a leading player in the
metallurgical construction market with specialized know-how in design, construction, and related equipment
manufacturing. We believe MCC will benefit from favorable industry conditions in 2019-2020, with steel mills
undergoing plant upgrades and relocation. MCC's advanced technologies will continue to support its business
expansion and ensure stable revenue growth over the next two years. This was reflected in MCC's new contract
growth, which rose 13.1% in 2018 and 20.3% in the first half of 2019.
Metallurgical engineering and construction (E&C) demand is cyclical, while housing E&C sees margin pressure. CMGC
derived about 22% of its revenue from the metallurgical E&C subsegment and about 37% from housing E&C in 2018.
We expect its metallurgical E&C revenue to grow strongly in 2019-2020, benefiting from the recent round of steel mill
relocation. However, future demand could be volatile as the relocation is one-off in nature and likely to be completed
in the next two to three years. Future demand from the domestic market will depend on plant upgrades and relocation
which are on a smaller scale. Housing E&C has the lowest margins among CMGC's subsectors owing to low entry
barriers and intense competition. We expect margins to soften further in 2019-2020 because of increasing price
pressures and rising raw material and labor costs.
We expect CMGC's credit measures to improve over the next 12-24 months. We estimate that CMGC's debt-to-EBITDA
ratio will continue to improve over the next two years to about 3.5x, compared with 5.2x in 2018. We expect the
company to maintain positive free operating cash flow (FOCF) on the back of consistent profit growth and good
working capital management. We also believe the company will maintain disciplined capital expenditure (capex) and
remain committed to deleveraging under the central State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission

of the State Council's (SASAC) requirement.
Timely and sufficient support from the parent company will enhance CMGC's credit profile. We expect CMGC to
remain a core subsidiary of China Minmetals Corp. (Minmetals). CMGC is Minmetals' sole arm for conducting the E&C
business, and contributed to about 50% of Minmetals' revenue and 30%-40% of EBITDA in 2018. We expect CMGC to
receive timely and sufficient support from Minmetals in case of need. This is reflected in a four-notch uplift in the
rating.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on CMGC reflects our view of the credit profile of the company's parent, Minmetals, which is
the key driver of our rating on CMGC.
We expect CMGC to remain a core subsidiary of the Minmetals group over the next 12-24 months, given its
significant revenue and profit contribution, and importance to the group's as well as the government's strategy of
promoting integration along the resources value chain.
We also expect CMGC to continue to receive extraordinary support from the Chinese government through the
Minmetals group. Meanwhile, we anticipate that CMGC will maintain steady revenue growth and profitability over
the next 12-24 months, and use its FOCF to repay debt, leading to a steady improvement in its credit metrics.

Downside scenario
We could lower the rating on CMGC if our assessment of Minmetals' group credit profile weakens, indicated by the
EBITDA interest coverage staying below 2x.
We would also downgrade CMGC if we believe the company is no longer a core subsidiary of the Minmetals
group. This could be owing to a major shift in Minmetals' corporate focus away from E&C, as indicated by a
sustained decline in E&C revenue. We expect the likelihood of this to be low in the next 12-24 months.

Upside scenario
We may raise the rating on CMGC if we assess that Minmetals' group credit profile has improved. This could
happen if we see more indications that Minmetals' role to the Chinese government has strengthened. Minmetals is
a state-owned assets investment company and will likely become more involved in consolidating minerals and
resources companies in China to ensure a secure supply of strategic metals and minerals.
We may also upgrade CMGC if Minmetals' financial performance significantly improves as a result of its continual
effort to deleverage, such that its ratio of debt to EBITDA meaningfully stays below 4x.

• China's real GDP growth to moderate to 6.2% in
2019 and 2020, from 6.6% in 2018.
• The Chinese government to continue infrastructure
spending in 2019 to boost GDP, which will lead to
8%-10% growth in the domestic E&C sector.
• CMGC's revenue to grow by 14%-16% in 2019-2020.

• Annual capex of Chinese renminbi (RMB) 5
billion-RMB6 billion over the next two years.
• Annual working capital outflow of RMB0.5
billion-RMB1.0 billion over the same period.
• Annual equity investments of RMB4 million-RMB5
million.

Base-case projections
Revenue to grow 14%-16% in 2019-2020. We expect the strong growth momentum in the construction segment to
continue at 15%-18% annually, driven by the recovery in the metallurgical industry and the Chinese government's
rising infrastructure investments. The equipment manufacturing segment will also expand robustly at 14%-16%
annually owing to large-scale steel plant upgrades and relocation. We anticipate stable growth of 5%-7% in property
development as CMGC aims to control debt. The resources development segment will grow much slower at 1%-3% as
growing domestic demand for electric vehicles is counterbalanced by international political uncertainties.
EBITDA margin to be largely stable. We estimate the EBITDA margin to be 5.4%-5.8% in 2019-2020, in line with the
2018 level. This is underpinned by the largely fixed-margin E&C business, which contributes over 70% to the
company's gross profit.

Company Description
CMGC, a subsidiary of Minmetals group, is one of the largest E&C companies in China and globally, specializing in
metallurgical E&C. The company has also built up its capability in the non-metallurgical E&C and non-construction
business in recent years. CMGC conducts the majority of its business operations through its direct subsidiary MCC.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
We expect CMGC to maintain its dominant market position in the Chinese metallurgical E&C industry. This is driven
by the company's strong sector expertise and long operational track record of constructing over 90% of major
metallurgical refining plants in China. CMGC also benefits from its stake in many leading metallurgical design institutes

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 17, 2019 5

China Metallurgical Group Corp.

in China, which gives it access to advanced technology, further strengthening its market standing.
At the same time, CMGC has expanded its business presence to non-metallurgical E&C--such as transportation
infrastructure, housing, and municipal engineering construction--by leveraging its expertise in handling complex
metallurgical projects. We believe this enhances the company's credit quality as it reduces reliance on the niche
metallurgical E&C segment, which has a small market size and cyclical demand. We expect the E&C segment to
remain the company's most important revenue (over 90%) and gross profit (over 75%) contributor in the next two
years, though the revenue mix might change slightly among the subsectors.
We expect the transportation and other E&C segments to drive revenue growth over the next 12-24 months, given that
CMGC is focused on expanding its business in these higher-margin segments. These subsegments also have higher
growth potential as the Chinese government is promoting infrastructure investments. On the other hand, we believe
the company's exposure to the housing E&C market will decline. This submarket suffers from intense competition and
offers lower margins. CMGC is also a relatively small player compared to the big central state-owned enterprise (SOE)
E&C companies. We anticipate the gross profit contribution from housing E&C to fall to 25% in 2020, from 27.5% in
2018, while the contribution from transportation E&C will rise 19.1% in 2020, from 16.5% in 2018. Given that the
metallurgical E&C segment will gain ground in 2019-2020 on recovering demand, we anticipate the gross profit
contribution will rise to 23.7% in 2020, from 20.6% in 2018. However, the recovery could fade in view of the steel mill
upgrade and relocation cycle.
CMGC also expanded into other non-construction fields, such as equipment manufacturing, property development,
and resources development. These segments have higher margins but are much smaller compared with its E&C
business. The equipment manufacturing business is likely to record healthy growth owing to increasing demand of
plant upgrade activities, but we expect the revenue contribution to remain at about 2% in 2019-2020. We also believe
CMGC will be prudent in land purchases as the company is aiming to contain its gross debt level.
In our view, CMGC's EBITDA margin will be flat over the next two years. While we expect some gross margin
improvement and change in revenue mix in the E&C sector, the slowdown in property development will offset the
improvement. In addition, increasing R&D expenses--measured as a percentage of revenue--to enhance technology
advancement also constrain the EBITDA margin in 2019-2020.

We view China Railway Construction Corp. Ltd. (CRCC), China Railway Group Ltd. (CRG), Power Construction Corp.
of China (PCC), and Shanghai Construction Group Co. Ltd. (SCG) as CMGC's closest peers.
CMGC is a leading player in the Chinese metallurgical E&C market. CRCC and CRG have superior market standing
and form a duopoly in China's railway and urban rail network. PCC is the top player in the Chinese and global
power-related E&C industry. SCG mainly operates in housing construction and is dominant in Shanghai. CMGC's
operational scale is smaller than all of its peers except SCG because of the niche metallurgical E&C market.
CMGC was the only one among its peers to generate positive FOCF and deleverage in 2018. However, CMGC's
financial leverage is still higher than that of CRG and CRCC. This is largely owing to its high debt level following its
operating loss in 2012. Since then, CMGC has been deleveraging and gradually reducing its debt level.

Chart 2

Financial Risk: Aggressive
We expect CMGC's leverage position to continue improving over the next two years as the company is committed to
deleveraging. We believe it will generate sustained positive FOCF and gradually reduce debt.
CMGC's operating cash flow will continue to improve, supported by revenue expansion and stable margins. At the
same time, we believe CMGC will manage its working capital prudently. We expect working capital to record a net
outflow of RMB0.5 billion–RMB1.0 billion in 2019-2020, from a net inflow of RMB199 million in 2018. This is mainly
because of the increase in infrastructure construction projects, but the outflow is very small relative to its operating
scale and compared with its peers. This is because CMGC is prudent in project selection, emphasizing profitability and
cash collection. The company has also taken other measures, such as asset securitization, to improve cash collection.
We also believe CMGC will manage its capex strictly, as indicated by the flat growth in capital spending in the first half
of 2019 while revenue grew by 20% year-on-year. We do not expect the company to engage in large projects and
anticipate that capex will be stable over the next two years.
We believe CMGC will continue to engage in PPP projects in transportation and municipal engineering construction to

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 17, 2019 8

China Metallurgical Group Corp.

support its business growth. The majority of projects in these two subsegments are through PPPs and require equity
investments in special purpose vehicles (SPVs) at the construction stage. CMGC has moderate exposure to such
projects, with revenue contribution of about 20% to the company's total revenue as of end-2018. However, CMGC
invests as a minority shareholder in PPP SPVs and is involved only in part of the construction work. As such, the
investment outflow could be partially offset by the operating inflows, with limited impact on the overall leverage.

Group Influence
The rating on CMGC is based on our assessment of Minmetals' credit profile. We believe CMGC is a core subsidiary of
Minmetals based on the following factors:
• CMGC is vital to the group's target to become a global powerhouse in the metals and mining industry. We expect
CMGC to be responsible for design and construction of all Minmetal's extraction and refining facilities, leveraging its
rich experience and expertise in the metallurgical E&C segment.

China Metallurgical Group Corp.

• CMGC will likely remain an important profit and cash flow contributor to the Minmetals group; CMGC contributed
30%-40% to the group's EBITDA in 2017 and 2018.
• We believe CMGC's leverage is commensurate with that of the group and expect the company's focus on improving
its working capital and reducing gross debt to be an important factor for the group to sustain its credit metrics.
