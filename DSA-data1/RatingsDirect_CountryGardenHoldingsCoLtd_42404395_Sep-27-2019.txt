Key Risks

Strong market position as one of the top three
developers in China by sales.

Exposure to risk of volatile demand in lower-tier cities, which are more susceptible to
economic cycles.

Geographically well-diversified, with a sizable land
bank.

Profitability may decline from peak as company focuses on cash collection amid China's
slowing economy, leading to moderate increase in leverage.

Proven ability to operate with a huge scale in
lower-tier cities with cost leadership.

One of the largest developers in China, with strong execution capability in lower-tier cities. We expect Country Garden
Holdings Co. Ltd. to maintain its strong position as one of the top three property developers in China by sales. The
company's growth in contracted sales is slowing down due to a high base and choppy performances in some of its
lower-tier cities. However, we believe Country Garden's strong execution in these cities can enable the company to
achieve mid-single-digit growth, and maintain its massive scale, with annual sales of about Chinese renminbi (RMB)
550 billion over the next two years. Country Garden has gone through a few severe downcycles in lower-tier cities, but
delivered reasonable sales. The company's scale is also much larger than that of other peers rated in the mid-to-high
'BB' category, including Shimao Property Holdings Ltd. and Greenland Holding Group Co. Ltd., and it has significant
cost advantages due to better economies of scale.

Margins may peak as the company focuses on cash collection amid current market conditions. We foresee a downward
trend in margins for Country Gardens due to market conditions in lower-tier cities. We expect Country Garden's
EBITDA margin to gradually drop to about 20% over the next two years, compared to about 22% in 2018-2019.
Despite having more projects in higher-tier cities in recent years, Country Garden leveraged on a recovery in lower-tier
cities to drive growth. The company is still exposed to tier-three and tier-four cities, with about 50% of its land bank
targeting buyers there. Such exposure runs the risk of more volatile demand, weaker home sales, and macroeconomic
factors such as the pullback in government subsidies for shantytown redevelopment. Indeed, sales conditions in these
cities are fluctuating more due to a slowing economy. That, along with Country Garden's priority in maintaining a good
cash collection rate, limits its pricing power and profitability.

Debt-to-EBITDA ratio to increase moderately to 4.0x-4.3x in 2019-20. This is mainly due to slowing revenue growth
and lower margins. However, Country Garden's controlled land spending can partially offset the impact. Among other
factors, Country Garden's more controlled land spending is also due to the recent operational incidents in Shanghai,
Hangzhou, and Liu'an, which have put the company under heightened public scrutiny. We therefore expect Country
Garden to focus more on project construction and completion quality rather than going on a buying spree. As such, its
leverage will still compare favorably with that of similar rated peers.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our expectation that Country Garden will continue its fast revenue growth and have
relatively stable margins over the next 12 months. We expect the company's market position and operating
efficiency to strengthen and solidify with its expanded scale. We also anticipate that Country Garden's leverage will
moderately increase over the period as its profitability wanes.

Downside scenario
We could downgrade Country Garden if its debt-to-EBITDA ratio deteriorates to more than 5x on a sustained basis
or its EBITDA interest coverage falls below 3x. This could happen if: (1) its revenue growth is materially lower than
25% in 2019, possibly due to delivery slippage, or its margin drops well below our expectation; or (2) the
company's debt-funded expansion becomes more aggressive than we expect.

Upside scenario
We could upgrade Country Garden if: (1) the company's profitability strengthens, demonstrating further
improvement in operational ability with EBITDA margin sustainably above 22%-23% and (2) the company
improves its leverage through more disciplined expansion and good revenue growth, such that its debt-to-EBITDA
ratio can be sustainably below 4x.

Assumptions

• China's property sales will increase by 12%-15% in
2019 driven by higher prices rather than volume
growth. The easing of liquidity, reasonable mortgage
availability despite some tightening lately will likely
drive up property sales
• Country Garden's average selling price (ASP) to
trend down by about 2% due to the company's
significant presence in lower-tier cities where prices
are likely to be volatile and weaker. Volumes to
increase 7%-8% in 2019 and 2%-4% in 2020, given
the company's abundant saleable resources and
solid execution record.

• The company's attributable contracted sales will
increase by roughly 6% to about RMB536 billion in
2019 and by about 3% to RMB550 billion in 2020.
The slower-than-industry growth will be due to a
combination of sales conditions in lower-tier cities, a
high base, and the company's own plan.
• Gross margin to fall to 24%-26% in 2019-2021 from
about 27% in 2018, owing to price flux in lower-tier
cities.
• Consolidated capital spending on land premiums
will be RMB170 billion-RMB200 billion each year to
support sales growth.
• Country Garden's consolidated construction cash
outflow will grow to RMB300 billion-RMB350 billion
in 2019 and 2020, compared with about RMB204
billion in 2018, in line with its project pipeline.

Base-case projections
Slower growth in adjusted debt over the next two to three years. Country Garden's adjusted borrowings will increase by
15%-20% each year over the next two to three years, much lesser than historical growth, due to company's plan of
adopting controlled spending on land.
EBITDA interest coverage to stay above 4x. We believe Country Garden can maintain its weighted average funding
cost at slightly over 6% in 2019-2020 despite fluctuating funding conditions. While banks may not see Country
Garden's projects in lower-tier cities as being of very high quality, the company has diverse funding channels and a
reducing need of new capital given lower spending.

Company Description
Country Garden is among China's largest integrated property developers, with 2,381 projects in over 279 cities. The
company is engaged in property development, construction, decoration, property management, property investment,
hotel development and management, robotics, and agriculture.
Country Garden began with a focus on development in lower-tier cities, originally around Guangdong province, and
then expanded nationwide and abroad. Country Garden was established in Guangdong in 1992 and listed on the Hong
Kong stock exchange in 2007.
As of December 2018, Country Garden's attributable land bank is 240.6 million square meter in China, of which 24% is
in Guangdong province. We estimate the company's land bank in China will generate about RMB1.69 trillion of
saleable resources, of which 19.3%, 33.9%, and 46.8% target buyers in tier one, tier two, and tier three and four cities.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
Country Garden's massive land bank will continue to support its strong market position, in our view. Country Garden's
attributable land bank is among the largest of Chinese developers and can last for four years at the company's current
pace of sales, which are no longer rapidly increasing. The land bank provides some room for Country Garden to trim
down land acquisitions while maintaining its huge scale. This is unlike other developers with a much smaller land
banks.
Country Garden's good cost control and economies of scale should help the company to enhance its competitive
advantage in lower-tier cities. We expect that the company's ratio of selling, general, and administrative expenses to
attributable contracted sales will continue to increase in 2019 due to more staff bonus payments. However, it should
decline in the next two years as bonuses reduce with slowing growth in contracted sales. This ratio, at 5.8% in 2018
and 4.5% in 2017, is still reasonable, considering that Country Garden has already made significant bonus payments.
We expect Country Garden's attributable contracted sales to reach about RMB536 billion in 2019, despite the weak
performance in the first half of the year. The company has total resources of RMB780 billion available for sale in 2019
and we estimate the sell-through rate will be 70% (2018: 76.4%). We attribute the weaker performance in the first half
of 2019 (H12019) to the high base in H1 2018, when the property market in lower-tier cities was booming from
demand spillover. However, Country Garden's sales have regained momentum in H22019, with policies such as hukou
and the easing of land registrations in second- and third-tier cities. We expect the demand recovery to enhance the
company's sales in the next 12-18 months.
In our view, Country Garden's non-consolidated contracted sales and debt do not contribute a major part of its
operations. That is despite the consolidated portion of contracted sales declining in 2018 and the company acquiring
more projects from local developers with only partial stakes in the past one to two years. We believe the attributable
ratio is low for Country Garden's non-consolidated contracted sales because the company may only have less than
20% stakes in a number of such joint venture projects.

We consider Longfor Group Holdings Ltd., and Shimao as Country Garden's peers. We select these companies
because they have geographically diversified property portfolios in China. We also consider Greenland as a peer of
Country Garden, given both companies have the highest sales nationwide among major property developers in China.
Country Garden has a much larger operating scale than Longfor and Shimao, and a moderately larger scale than
Greenland. However, Country Garden focuses more on mass-market, fast-churn products in lower-tier cities with more
volatile demand over the property cycles. In contrast, these peers have larger exposure to mid- to high-end products in
more developed cities. That is also evidenced by these companies' contracted sales ASP, which is more than Country

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 6, 2019 8

Country Garden Holdings Co. Ltd.

Garden's ASP of about RMB9,000 per square meter. Country Garden's profitability is therefore the lowest among
peers, even in comparison to Greenland, which has much better profit in the property segment, after taking out the
construction segment.
Greenland has more diversified businesses than Country Garden because it is also involved in energy, construction,
and other businesses. Despite some improvement, Greenland's leverage is still the weakest among the peers, and is
much higher than Country Garden's. This is because of Greenland's sizable exposure to commercial properties with
slower sell-through, and its large capital spending to expand into other business segments (including construction and
consumer) in recent years.
Longfor has a track record of more prudent financial management and an increasing rental income contribution from
both shopping malls and long-term rental apartments. Its leverage is moderately lower than Country Garden's and
much lower than that of the other peers. These factors support the ratings on Longfor at the higher investment-grade
level.
Although Shimao has a lesser scale and slightly higher leverage than Country Garden, it fares much better on
profitability and has a more balanced land bank with more projects in higher-tier cities. These strengths balance out
Shimao's relative weakness in comparison to Country Garden, and justify the issuer credit rating of both companies
being at the same level of 'BB+'.

Financial Risk: Aggressive
We estimate Country Garden's proportionately consolidated debt-to-EBITDA ratio will be very similar to the
consolidated figure, at around 4.0x in 2018-2019. We believe that this is a reasonable situation, mainly because the
company's non-consolidating contracted sales on an attributable basis are not large.
We believe Country Garden's financial guarantees to joint ventures have already captured a considerable portion of its
off-balance-sheet debt. As of end-2018, such guarantees amount to RMB58 billion; we include these in our adjusted
debt. Country Garden's proportional off-balance-sheet debt should only be mildly more than this figure. In our view,
this is mainly because most joint venture projects with local developers require Country Garden, as the bigger partner,
to provide a guarantee.
Country Garden's small trust financing exposure contributes favorably to its capital structure. In 2018, only about 10%
of the company's total reported debt comprised different types of trust financing. However, as a Chinese developer
rated in the high 'BB' category, we would expect Country Garden to have a stronger capital structure and limited
exposure to various type of non-standard financing.

Liquidity: Adequate
We forecast that Country Garden will maintain adequate liquidity, with the ratio of sources to uses of liquidity of
3.0x-3.5x in 2019. While this level is commensurate with a higher liquidity score, our assessment reflects the
company's likely substantially higher land acquisitions than the committed amount.
In our view, as a sizable property developer with a long record, Country Garden has good banking relationships and
relatively diverse funding channels, both onshore and offshore, such as the rental-housing-backed securities it issued in
2018.

Covenant Analysis
Compliance expectations
The major financial covenants in Country Garden's offshore bank borrowings relate to: (1) consolidated tangible net
worth; (2) EBITDA interest coverage; and (3) ratio of consolidated total net borrowings to tangible net worth.
Country Garden was in compliance with these covenants as on Dec. 31, 2018.

Requirements
Country Garden exceeds the required levels of the financial covenants by various margins. We believe that the
company has adequate headroom for all of them.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

Given Country Garden's rapid expansion in recent years and its fast turnover project cycle, environment risk
factors are becoming more material. However, they do not directly affect our credit analysis.
We believe Country Garden's increasing green project development and implementation of SSGF (Sci-tech, Safe &
Share, Green, Fine & Fast) construction system could shorten its construction cycle, reducing consumption of
construction resources. This should lower the environmental impact of the company's business while strengthening
its fast turnover model.
We believe quality control and building safety remain key risks to Country Garden's social reputation. Two
operational accidents with six casualties in 2018 caused significant reputational damage. These have partly led to a
scaling back of Country Garden's growth targets and implementation of new control measures of more regular site
supervision, weekly safety checks by third-party inspectors, and application of more stringent standards on
material sourcing.
Country Garden's aggressive sales targets in the past could also be a source of social discontent--accelerated
planning and construction cycles could affect product quality, while frequent changes to pricing could cause
large-scale homebuyer disputes.
Although we see Country Garden's corporate governance as neutral to the credit standing, controlling ownership
remains a risk as the owner family occupies six of the 14 seats on the board and could exert significant influence on
decisions.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
As of Dec. 31, 2018, Country Garden's capital structure consists of RMB119.1 billion in secured debt and RMB91.7
billion in unsecured debt issued at the holding company level, and RMB117.7 billion in unsecured debt issued by its
operating subsidiaries.

Analytical conclusions
Country Garden's secured and priority debt accounts for slightly more than 70% of its total debt. We rate the
company's senior unsecured notes at 'BB', one notch lower than the issuer credit rating to reflect the significant
subordination risks.
