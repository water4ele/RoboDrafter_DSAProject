Overview
Key strengths

Key risks

Alfa’s diversification in product and services industries with
relatively low correlation.

Exposure to fluctuations in the cost of raw materials that pressures margins.

Widespread geographic footprint, with presence in developed and
emerging markets.

Alfa’s track-record of acquisitions has put intermittent pressure on its
financial position.

Management maintains prudent risk policies, and fosters
innovation and product development.

Macro-related factors linked to the global business cycles, political instability,
or international trade constraints.

Strong liquidity and comfortable debt maturity profile.

A leading business group with a diversified portfolio and broad geographic footprint.With revenues of $19.1 billion in
2018, Alfa is a leading conglomerate with operations across five industries and a global presence in 28 countries. Alfa
has expanded its geographic footprint in order to benefit from high-growth emerging markets and a more stable
environment in Europe and the U.S. In 2018, 70% of the group's total sales were outside of Mexico, compared with
61.5% in 2013. In addition, none of its business units accounts for more than 40% of its revenue or adjusted EBITDA.

Portfolio with mostly uncorrelated end-market cyclicality patterns, although exposed to the petrochemical, automotive,
and oil and gas industries. We believe Alfa's portfolio brings together companies with various end-market cyclicality
patterns that have a relatively low correlation, which we believe helps diminish the volatility of earnings. Still, in our
view, Alfa's credit profile is constrained by the cyclicality of its operations in the petrochemical, automotive, and the oil
and gas industries, which together represent 63% of the group's revenues. Accordingly, Alfa's most recent results
suffered the impact of less favorable oil and feedstock prices and the subdued demand for consumer durables (cars)
across advanced and emerging market economies.

Alfa's track-record of important acquisitions has put intermittent pressure on its financial position.Alfa has expanded
its footprint through a combination of steady internal expansion growth and strategic acquisitions. We believe the
group would continue actively seeking growth opportunities to strengthen its business portfolio, while committing to
its financial policy of maintaining net debt to EBITDA below 2.5x on a consolidated basis.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our expectation that Alfa will remain committed to its leverage policy and keep its debt
to EBITDA below 3.0x. We also expect the group to protect its cash flow generation and liquidity amid emerging
risks on prices of certain commodities and increasing headwinds to the Mexican economy.

Downside scenario
A negative rating action could occur in the next 12-24 months if Alfa's operating and financial performance
deviates from our current expectations, resulting in adjusted debt to EBITDA consistently above 3.0x. This could
arise from weaker economic activity in Mexico and the U.S., two of Alfa's core markets, a sharp decline in
petrochemical prices, or adverse conditions in the North American auto industry.

Upside scenario
An upgrade is less likely in the near term and is constrained by the group's business risk profile and the inherent
volatility of the industries in which Alpek and Nemak operate, given that both companies account for more than
60% of Alfa's consolidated revenue. However, we could raise the ratings on Alfa in the next two years if it
consistently posts debt to EBITDA below 2.0x and funds from operations (FFO) to debt above 45%.

• We expect Sigma to post low volume growth in
most of the locations where it operates, while it
maintains its effective pricing strategy to cope with
raw material price volatility. This should drive
mid-single digit revenue growth in the next two
years.
Alpek S.A.B. de C.V.
• We expect consolidated revenues to decrease by
approximately 2.5% in Mexican peso terms this year
because we expect moderate growth, especially in
the polyester segment. The benefit from a full year's
operation at PQS will most likely not be enough to
offset the expected contraction in crude oil prices,
and the more stable petrochemical margins won't
benefit from the mid-year spike last year. In 2020,
we expect revenue growth of about 8%, as
additional PET capacity coming from the Corpus
Christi facility comes online towards the end of the
year, and a stronger dollar bolsters the company's
dollar-based revenues.
Nemak S.A.B. de C.V.
• Nemak's revenue to decline 4.1% for 2019 mainly
due to an 8% drop in volumes, stemming from a
volatile trend in the demand for auto parts in the
company's main markets. In addition, the lower
revenue will result from global economic uncertainty
owing to trade tensions. Revenue to grow 5.7% in
2020, given our belief that Nemak's volumes will
recover amid greater clarity for the industry's
outlook.
Axtel S.A.B. de C.V.
• Revenue drop of 15% for 2019 given the elimination
of the massive business operations, mitigated by the
increase in services to the enterprise and
government sectors. For 2020 and afterwards, we

Alfa S.A.B. de C.V.

expect revenue growth to average 4.7%, in line with
the corporate and government sectors' sales cycle.
For 2019, we expect EBITDA margins at about 14.2%,
slightly lower than in 2018, as a result of:
Sigma
• We expect Sigma to post an adjusted EBITDA
margin of about 11.5% in 2019 and 2020. In our
view, elevated costs and volatile raw material prices
will continue pressuring the company's profitability.
Sigma is implementing various strategies to maintain
its EBITDA margin at the current level, including
price adjustments, inventory building, and hedging
strategies, such as its $550 million forward to hedge
up to six months of its raw material needs in
Mexico.
Alpek
• EBITDA to decrease by about 10% in 2019 due to
lower crude oil and feedstock prices and less
favorable petrochemical margins that offset PQS's
higher volumes. In 2020, we expect EBITDA to
recover amid additional capacity at the Corpus
Christi facility. Alpek will receive one-third of this
capacity, coupled with strong results from its
Brazilian assets.
Nemak
• EBITDA to drop in 2019 because of industry
uncertainty and downside risks for demand growth
that could pressure volumes. However, we assume
that the company would align its operating strategy
with the industry's growth trends in 2020, to support
its EBITDA.
Axtel
• EBITDA margins to remain at about 40%,
incorporating the divestment of towers that would
result in lower maintenance costs on a higher scale
that more than offset the increase in leasing
expenses, going forward. Also, we expect higher
margins stemming from the divestment of the less
profitable massive business segment.

Alfa S.A.B. de C.V.

Capital expenditures (capex) of about MXN20.5 billion
for 2019 and 2020.
• Sigma's annual capex of about 3% of total sales per
year, which mainly includes maintenance, and
strategic and innovation projects.
• Alpek's capex of about $310 million (MXN6.1 billion)
in 2019, including about $50 million for the Altamira
cogeneration power plant and the acquisition of
Perpetual Recycling Solutions, LLC. $240 million
(MXN4.4 billion) in capex for 2020, mainly for
constructing the Corpus Christi plant, smaller
bolt-on expansions, and maintenance purposes.
• Nemak's capex of about $320 million and $355
million for 2019 and 2020, respectively. The
replacement of existing platforms, together with
incremental business in engines blocks, structural
and EV components, will account for 80% of capex,
with the maintenance capex representing the
remainder.
• Axtel's capex of about MXN2.5 billion for the
following two years, or approximately 20% of
revenues.
Based on these assumptions, we arrive at the following
adjusted credit measures:
• EBITDA margins between 14.2% and 14.4% for the
next two years;
• Debt to EBITDA of 2.4x at the end of fiscal 2019,
dropping to 2.2x in 2020 due to EBITDA growth and
debt reduction;
• FFO to debt of about 30% for the next two years;
and
• Average free operating cash flow (FOCF) to debt in
the 10%-15% range in the next two years.

Base-case projections
Low single-digit revenue growth in 2019, compared with high growth rates in previous years, because of lower crude
oil and feedstock prices and slower dynamics in the auto industry.

Alfa S.A.B. de C.V.

Net leverage to remain below 3.0x in the next two years thanks to prudent financial policy. We don't foresee any
significant increase in debt because we expect the group to generate sufficient cash flows to fund its working capital
and most of its capex requirements its subsidiaries.

Company Description
Alfa is a holding company that manages a portfolio of diversified subsidiaries: Sigma, Alpek, Nemak, Axtel, and
Newpek. Alfa was founded in 1974, is based in Mexico, and its shares are quoted on the Mexican Stock Exchange, and
on Latibex, the market for Latin American shares on the Madrid Stock Exchange.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
Alfa's business risk profile reflects its leading position in the main markets where it participates through its subsidiaries.
The group operates in the petrochemical, telecommunications, high-tech aluminum automotive components, branded
refrigerated foods, and oil and gas industries. We believe Alfa's portfolio comprises companies that operate in
industries with low correlation, providing cushion against macroeconomic downturns.
Chart 4

Refrigerated foods
In our view, Sigma's broad geographic and product diversification, extensive supply chain and distribution network,
and efficient global sourcing provide a significant competitive advantage. These allow the company to handle the
intense competition inherent to the industry, maintain top-line growth across economic cycles, and mitigate its
exposure to volatile foreign exchange rates and raw material prices. We expect Sigma to continue focusing on its
pricing strategy and value-added product mix to achieve further operating efficiencies, while it maintains its EBITDA

Alfa S.A.B. de C.V.

margins in the 11.5%-12.0% range.

Aluminum automotive parts
By the end of 2018, Nemak generated $4.7 billion in revenue, consisting of sales of heads (49%), blocks (34%),
transmissions and others (14%), and structural and EV components (3%). The company operates 38 manufacturing
plants and 12 technology centers across 16 countries. We believe Nemak maintains a strong position across its
markets and segments, because it's at least twice the size of its next competitor in terms of volumes, while benefiting
from its technological capacity and client/geography diversification.
Nemak is continuing to broaden its strategy to tap into the structural and EV components market. However, the
industry's lower demand due to economic uncertainty pressured Nemak's profitability in 2018. At the same time, the
company's other business units posted strong performance through its mechanism for passing through aluminum-price
fluctuations to the end customers. As a result, Nemak maintained EBITDA margins at about 16% last year, in line with
our estimates for the industry average. We believe the company will continue evaluating market performance in order
to adjust its strategy without risking its profitability in the next few years.

Petrochemicals and synthetic fibers
Through a combination of internal growth, acquisitions, and strategic joint ventures (JVs), Alpek has established a solid
position in the markets in which it operates. It's a leading integrated polyester producer in the Americas, the only
manufacturer of polypropylene and caprolactam in Mexico, and the largest expandable polystyrene producer in the
Americas.
We view the acquisition of Petrobras' polyester assets in Brazil (PQS) in 2018 and the JV to acquire the Corpus Christi
plant as credit positives, strengthening Alpek's market share. However, these new projects also increase the company's
concentration in the polyester segment, which currently accounts for 75% of total revenue. As a result, we still assess
Alpek's revenue stream as somewhat concentrated by product and geography. Moreover, our ratings continue to
reflect its exposure to commodity price volatility and industry cycles.
On the other hand, Alpek's importance as a key player in the polyester industry, with a leading share in North America
and its end-markets' resilience to economic downturns; its satisfactory corporate management and governance; and its
long-term relationships with customers and suppliers offset its weaknesses.

Telecommunications
Axtel provides TIC services in Mexico, mainly to the corporate, financial, and government entities. At the end of 2018,
it divested 82% of its mass-market business segment to Grupo Televisa S.A.B. (BBB+/Stable/--), and sold the
remaining 18% to Megacable during the second quarter of 2019. This divestment represented Axtel's strategy to focus
on its most profitable business lines in order to continue deleveraging its capital structure. We believe its partnership
with Microsoft, coupled with its operating synergies with Alestra, will reduce its geographic concentration by
increasing its presence in the U.S.

Hydrocarbons, and oil and gas services
Newpek is Alfa's oil & gas exploration and production company with operations in the U.S. and Mexico; it represents
about 1% of the group's total revenues. During 2018, Newpek partially divested its assets in the Eagle Ford Shale. In

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 4, 2019 12

Alfa S.A.B. de C.V.

addition, it sold its participation in the Wilcox formation, also in Texas. The process of selling approximately 11,000
remaining acres in the U.S. continues, in line with its strategy to focus on its local operations. In Mexico, the company
continued operating mature oil fields at San Andrés and Tierra Blanca in the state of Veracruz, both under the 2013
service contracts with Pemex.

diversification modifier. Most of its businesses are uncorrelated, which mitigate impacts from potential economic
downturns. Alfa and its conglomerate peers have very different portfolio mixes, which make their operating and
financial metrics not entirely comparable.

Financial Risk: Intermediate
Alfa's 2018 consolidated operating and financial results were in line with our expectations. The group's debt to
EBITDA of 2.5x reflect a prudent financial policy towards debt, complemented by robust performance in the
petrochemical, auto components and food segments. Our base-case scenario for 2019 assumes that Alfa's operating
performance will suffer the impact of subdued economic conditions in key markets, uncertain geopolitical
environment, and volatility in commodity prices. These factors may somewhat temper earnings growth but they're
unlikely to derail the improvement in the group's financial position.
Yet, we expect Alfa to protect its consolidated cash flow generation and maintain adjusted debt to EBITDA below 3.0x
on a consistent basis. Although our base-case scenario doesn't contemplate M&A activity in the next 12 months, we
will continue to monitor the group's acquisitive growth strategy.

Liquidity: Strong
We assess Alfa's liquidity on a consolidated basis as strong. In our view, the group's sources of liquidity will exceed
uses by at least 1.5x in 2018 and at least 1.0x for the subsequent 12 months. We also forecast that liquidity sources will
exceed uses even if EBITDA declines by more than 30% in the next 12 months.
Our liquidity analysis also incorporates qualitative factors, including our view that Alfa has the capacity to withstand
high-impact, low-probability events without refinancing, that it has sound banking relationships, and has proven access
to international capital markets.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

June 30, 2019;

• Debt maturities of about $1.0 billion for the next 12
months;

• Available committed credit lines of about $1.6 billion
in 2019; and

months.

• Capex of about $1.1 billion for the next 12 months;
• Dividend payments of about $252 million for the
next 12 months; and
• Share repurchases of about $293 million for the next
12 months.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

We believe environmental and social risks have taken a central role in Alfa's credit profile. The petrochemical
industry is subject to increasing regulation because most of the feedstock used in its processes comes from
petroleum, a nonrenewable resource. Accordingly, the auto-part faces increasingly stringent regulations for
emissions control, as well as for energy and water consumption. Social factors, such as food processing safety
methods and a strategic shift toward a value-added nutritional portfolio, are also key in our rating analysis of Alfa.
However, we believe the group is taking initiatives to address its ESG exposures and has set ambitious targets.
With its recent acquisition of Perpetual Recycling Solutions, Alpek has become the largest PET recycler in the U.S.
Additionally, in 2018, through Nemak, the group invested more than $10.5 million in emissions reduction, waste
disposal, and remediation, along with other efforts. This has led to a total reduction of 72,225 tons of CO2
equivalent, or the avoidance of emissions equivalent to approximately 15,000 cars in a year. Moreover, the group
continues to invest heavily in research and development (R&D) to anticipate long-term market trends. Since 2010,
it has improved over 410 products' nutritional profiles (reducing sodium, sugar, and fat content), adapting to new
consumer trends. In 2017, Sigma invested more than $20.2 million in R&D, including health and nutritional
initiatives (about 10% of total capex).
We view Alfa's management and governance as satisfactory, reflecting its proven track record in strategic planning
and execution processes as well as management's expertise and experience.

Group Influence
Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
Alfa's capital structure consists of $500 million senior unsecured notes due 2024 and $500 million senior unsecured
notes due 2044. It also includes bank loans issued at the holding company level.

Analytical conclusions
We rate Alfa's senior unsecured notes 'BBB-', one notch below the issuer credit rating, reflecting the structural
subordination of the notes compared with Alfa subsidiaries' debt.
