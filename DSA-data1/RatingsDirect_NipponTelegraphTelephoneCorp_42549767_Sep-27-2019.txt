Key risks

Maintenance of an overwhelming market position in Japan's
fixed-line and fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) markets

A likely increase in downward pressure on the company's consolidated
profitability due to intensifying competition in the mobile communications
market

A prospect of maintaining a leading position and solid
customer base in increasingly competitive mobile
communications markets

A likelihood of the company's overseas information technology (IT) service
business, which it focuses on as a growth area, taking time to improve
profitability, due to fierce competition

World-class technology
Extremely sound financial standing supported by a strong
ability to generate cash flow
Expectation of maintaining sound financial standing amid
continued high capital expenditure and shareholder returns

Japan-based telecommunications company Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. (NTT) is likely to maintain a leading
position and a strong customer base in an increasingly competitive domestic mobile communications market. It also
maintains an overwhelming market position in Japan's fixed-line and FTTH markets. The NTT group has a dominant
share of about 70% of the domestic fixed-line and FTTH markets. S&P Global Ratings expects the group to maintain
strong competitiveness in the maturing FTTH business with an increase in its number of customers through
wholesales services. In the domestic mobile communications market, competition is likely to further intensify due to
both government initiatives to promote competition and the planned market entry of Japan-based online marketplace
operator and electronic commerce company Rakuten Inc. However, we think the NTT group can maintain an
industry-leading position and a solid customer base in the domestic mobile communications market. We hold this view
because NTT DOCOMO Inc., the group's core mobile communications subsidiary, has high communication quality
and strong brand recognition. In addition, the company offers a service bundling mobile communications services with
FTTH services with discounted prices. It also has the capability to reduce its mobile phone rates, given its ample
EBITDA.
The group's consolidated profitability will likely recover in the following two years after a temporary decline, which
stemmed from mobile phone rate cuts. In the next year, we expect the group's consolidated profitability to come under
pressure arising from substantial cuts in its mobile phone rates and upfront expenses to reduce future costs of its

fixed-line business. After next year, profitability will likely improve, though moderately, because of cost reductions and
other factors. The NTT group's profitability is slightly lower than that of global major peers, which we consider a
constraint on our ratings on the company. We expect downward pressure on the ratings to increase if the group's
profitability falls below our assumptions or the profitability's recovery will be delayed by intensifying competition in
the mobile communications business.
We project the NTT group will maintain extremely sound financial standing supported by its ability to generate very
strong cash flow. The group plans to step up capital investments in next-generation 5G mobile wireless products and
services as well as overseas investment. At the same time, we expect the group to make efforts to improve efficiency
in investment through the use of existing 4G infrastructure. The group is likely to continue to undertake an aggressive
shareholder return policy. Even so, we expect it to maintain its extremely sound financial standing, under a
conservative financial policy thanks to use of strong consolidated cash flow.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on NTT reflects our view that the group's consolidated profitability will temporarily decline in
the next year or so due to mobile phone rate cuts and intensifying competition in its mobile communications
business but will recover in the following two years or so, because of cost reductions. We believe the NTT group
can sustain its leading position and high competitiveness in domestic telecommunications by maintaining its solid
customer base through price cuts. We also expect the NTT group to maintain its extremely sound financial
standing in the immediate future under prudent financial management.

Downside scenario
We may consider downgrading NTT if competition in fixed-line and mobile communications markets continues to
intensify, significantly weakening the group's market position; or if its consolidated EBITDA margin is highly likely
to fall below 27% for a sustained period despite efforts to cut costs. We may also lower the rating if we see a
greater likelihood of NTT's ratio of debt to EBITDA consistently exceeding 1.5x. This could occur, for example, as
a result of a deterioration of earnings, or aggressive investments or shareholder returns. A downgrade would also
be possible if we concluded that material changes to regulations would significantly weaken the group's credit
quality.

Upside scenario
Conversely, we may raise the rating if competitive pressure on the NTT group's main businesses eases and we
anticipate material improvement in its market positions and profitability. However, we think this scenario is
unlikely for the foreseeable future given the current severe competitive environment and the group's slightly lower
profitability than the global average in the industry.

• A moderate decline in revenue and EBITDA margin
for the NTT group's mobile communications
business in the next year or so due to substantial
cuts in mobile phone rates, and a slight recovery of
its profitability afterward, thanks to cost reductions
and other factors.
• A continued decrease in operating revenue in its
regional communications business due to persistent
decline in revenue from fixed-line telephony.
• A minor decline in EBITDA margin in its regional
communications business in the next year or so due
to lower profits and upfront expenses to reduce
future costs, followed by a slight margin recovery,
stemming from cost reductions and other factors.
• A gradual increase in revenue in its IT service
business thanks to measures to enhance earnings
and reduce costs, especially in overseas operations,
leading to moderate improvement in EBTDA
margin.
• Annual consolidated capital expenditure of about
¥1.7 trillion.
• Major shareholder returns that are mostly affordable
given the company's free operating cash flow
(FOCF).
