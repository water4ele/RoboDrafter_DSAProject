Overview
Key Strengths

Key Risks

Market leader with more than 50% volume share in the niche corn oil segment within
China's large and competitive edible oil industry.

Small player in the competitive aluminum industry
with supplier concentration.

Good operating efficiency with stable EBITDA margin of 13%-15%, given location of
production capacity close to raw material sources, and economies of scale.

Limited pricing power and exposure to volatile raw
material costs.

Improving business diversity with rising profit contribution from aluminum products.

High debt leverage and slow deleveraging prospects
conditional on capex reduction.
Ongoing exposure to refinancing pressure due to
short-dated debt profile.

Debt maturities in 2019 are manageable, although reliance on short-term debt could increase.Shandong Sanxing Group
Co. Ltd. (Sanxing) has bullet debt maturities of Chinese renminbi (RMB) 1.8 billion due in September to December of
2019, and RMB1.2 billion due in 2020. This debt is significantly higher than the parent company's unrestricted cash for
debt repayment of about RMB500 million as of June 30, 2019. Sanxing's refinancing plan includes property sales
proceed of RMB250 million, proceeds from sale of financial investments of RMB350 million, and a newly obtained
bank loan of RMB250 million. The company's issuance of a three-year public bond of RMB319 million in August 2019
will also fund its debt repayment. The issuance demonstrates Sanxing's access to onshore long-term financing.
However, we believe the company is likely to resort to short-term financing to repay its debt maturities in 2020, given
tight credit conditions and low investor appetite for long-term debt issued by privately owned enterprises. The
short-debt maturity profile will expose Sanxing to refinancing risks.
Leverage will remain high. Expanding the aluminum processing segment over the past six years has resulted in high
leverage for Sanxing. We expect the company's leverage to stabilize over the next two years. However, this hinges on
capital expenditure (capex) falling significantly during the period, given operating cash flows will remain low and
curtailed by interest expense servicing.
Dominant market position in the niche corn oil industry will remain intact. Sanxing accounts for 50%-60% of the
production in China's corn oil industry, with its own brand "Changshouhua" and a role as a contracted manufacturer
for leading edible oil companies. The company's scale and proximity to raw materials are key supports for its
competitive position and provide cost advantages over smaller manufacturers.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on Sanxing reflects our expectation that the company will refinance its debt maturities in 2019,
given its satisfactory access to the domestic bond market in China and banking relationships.
We also expect Sanxing's free cash flow to remain positive, driven by a stabilization of its corn oil business and
lower capex in the next 12 months.

Downside scenario
We could lower the rating if Sanxing's debt-to-EBITDA ratio exceeds 5.0x. This could happen if the company's
capital investment is more aggressive than we anticipate, driven by continuous fast capacity expansion or large
acquisitions.
We could also lower the rating if Sanxing encounters difficulty in rolling over its upcoming maturities, which would
have a meaningful negative impact on its liquidity position.
We could also lower the rating if the company's revenue continues to decline, signaling a potential deterioration in
its competitive position.

Upside scenario
We could raise the rating if Sanxing lengthens its debt maturities to higher than two years. Alternatively, we could
raise the rating if the company lowers its debt-to-EBITDA ratio below 4.0x on a sustained basis, while maintaining
adequate liquidity.

Assumptions

• China's GDP will grow 6.2% in 2019 and 2020, from
6.6% in 2018. Despite a slowdown, economic
expansion will continue to support consumption
growth in China over the next two to three years.
• Growth in edible oil consumption (including corn oil)
will be 2%-4%, given the nature of food staples.
• Demand for aluminum products will continue to
increase broadly on par with China's GDP growth,
driven by rising demand and improving aluminum
prices due to reduced capacity.

• Annual capex will normalize to RMB250
million-RMB400 million in 2019-2020, from RMB750
million in 2017 and RMB167 million in 2018, mainly
for maintenance because capacity expansion in
aluminum products is complete.
• Annual cash dividend to be limited in 2019-2020.

Base-case projections
Revenue growth to be 5%-7% in 2019, from 2% in the first half of 2019 and a 2% decline in 2018. Stabilizing corn oil
prices should increase corn oil sales by 2%-4% per year in 2019-2020, with stable sales volume, after the corn oil
segment's revenue declined by 7% in 2018. Aluminum products sales will also grow 5%-10% in 2019 and 2020, driven
by the acquisition of a new automobile client and a gradual ramp up of capacity. But growth in aluminum product sales
will be lower than the 23% growth in 2018 because the company has tightened its terms for credit sales to small
customers to control the risk of bad debts.
Broadly stable operating performance over the next 12-24 months. We believe steady organic growth of corn oil and an
improved demand-supply equation from reduced aluminum capacity will support stability in Sanxing's operations. The
company has flat EBITDA in the first half of 2019. Our base-case estimate is that the company's EBITDA will remain
stable at RMB1.7 billion–RMB1.8 billion in 2019-2020, compared to RMB1.86 billion in 2018.
Moderately positive discretionary cash flow and stable debt balance over the next 12-24 months. Operating cash flow
to increase slightly to RMB350 million–RMB550 million in 2019-2020, from approximately RMB300 million in 2018, as
the company reverses some inventory buildup alongside previous expansion. Discretionary cash flow will remain
slightly positive as capex will normalize to RMB250 million–RMB400 million during the period.

Company Description
Sanxing is the largest corn oil manufacturer in China. The company is also engaged in the production and distribution
of lightweight aluminum alloy products in China.

Business Risk: Weak
We view Sanxing's small market share in China's edible oil industry as a key constraint to its business strength. The
company had a 3.2% share of the edible oil retail market in 2018, according to Euromonitor, compared with 40% and
14% share for the top two companies. Sanxing's small scale limits its pricing power, especially amid an edible oil
supply glut and falling edible oil price. The company's corn oil revenue declined to RMB6.2 billion in 2018, after
peaking at RMB7.5 billion in 2016, mainly due to falling prices as volume remained broadly stable at about 400,000
tons during the period.
Sanxing will continue to face substitution risk and competitive pressure from manufacturers of other edible oils, given
the large size of that market. Although the company accounts for 50%-60% of China's corn oil industry volume, corn
oil is a small segment of the edible oil market. Soybean oil, representing 50% of edible oil in China, will likely see
higher price volatility due to U.S.-China trade tensions that have limited soy bean imports from the U.S. The price
volatility of soybean oil will likely trickle down to corn oil and pressure Sanxing's revenue growth. We forecast the
company's corn oil volume growth will slow to 1%-2% over the next two years, compared with the average growth of
7% during 2012-2017.
We believe Sanxing's expansion into aluminum processing and the growing contribution from the operation exposes it
to higher earnings volatility. The company expanded into lightweight alloy manufacturing in 2013 to benefit from its
cost advantage given its proximity to the largest Chinese upstream aluminum producer, China Hongqiao Group Ltd.
Its products include railway carriages, shipping containers, and lightweight auto-parts. We estimate aluminum alloy
products will account for 25%-28% of Sanxing's revenue in 2019-2020, from 20% in 2017 and 14% in 2014. While the
expansion adds business diversity, it also exposes the company to higher earnings volatility, given more volatile raw
material prices. Gross profit margin in the operation was 7.5%-18% during 2013-2018.
Furthermore, due to Sanxing's miniscule scale and limited track record, its lightweight alloy volume prediction is
uncertain. The company usually enters into contracts of one to two years with its customers. It does not have any
captive customers and clients' stability is not tested, which makes future volume prediction difficult. Its lightweight
alloy utilization rate declined to 60%-70% in 2018, from 80% in 2017, following its new capacity rollout. We only
forecast a gradual ramp up of utilization rate in 2019-2020. Nevertheless, the company has good customer diversity,
which helps to mitigate the client retention risk. Its top five customers account for 13% of the segment sales.
Sanxing's stable corn oil profitability provides some visibility on its earnings. This segment will account for 50%-60%
of gross profit through 2020. Sanxing has steadily enhanced its product portfolio by increasing sales of branded oil to
mitigate the revenue headwind. The gross profit contribution of Sanxing's branded oil segment has increased to 36% in
2017, from 31% in 2014, while contribution of non-branded oil remained at 19%. Branded oil commanded 28%-35%
gross profit margin, compared to non-branded oil's gross margin of less than 15% during 2013-2018. We expect
continual portfolio enhancement will support Sanxing's steady earnings. We believe its higher oil yields and better
access to raw materials also contribute to stable profitability. The company's production plants for corn oil are
strategically located in major corn-producing regions in China.

We consider Fufeng Group Ltd., High Liner Foods Inc., and Tereos SCA as comparable peers for Sanxing because all
of them are market leaders in their respective niche product segments within the packaged foods sector.
Compared with Fufeng, Sanxing has two distinct operations in corn oil and aluminum and has similar profitability but
materially weaker operating cash flows. Fufeng benefits from a better scale because its dominance in monosodium
glutamate and amino acids arises from corn-processing. Sanxing has much higher debt leverage than Fufeng, due to its
fast capacity expansion to grow its aluminum products business.
Compared with High Liner Foods, which produces frozen food, Sanxing is much larger in scale, more profitable, and
has better business diversity.
Tereos, the third-largest sugar producer globally, and Sanxing generate revenue from volatile commodity products.
But Sanxing has lower geographic diversity; Tereos operates in both Europe and Brazil.
Sanxing has higher profitability than Tereos and High Liner Foods, but lower than Fufeng. Over the past three years,
Sanxing's EBITDA margin has been 14.4%, compared to Fufeng's 16%, Tereos' 12%, and High Liner Food's 7%.

Financial Risk: Aggressive
We expect Sanxing's debt leverage to remain high at more than 4x through 2021, constraining its credit quality. The
company's expansion into aluminum processing increased leverage to 4.4x in 2018, from 3.1x in 2013, after
accumulated capex of RMB4.4 billion in 2014-2017. During the same period, the company generated negative free
cash flow, as inventory build-up alongside the expansion resulted in meagre operating cash flow of RMB200 million
annually.
Leverage should stabilize at 4.2x-4.6x in 2019-2020, from 4.4x in 2018, given our expectation of significant capex
reduction over the next two years. Sanxing has started exercising some financial discipline. The company cut capex to
RMB167 million in 2018 and to RMB287 million in the first half of 2019. Our base-case assumes that Sanxing's capex
will remain low at RMB250 million–RMB400 million in 2019-2020 as its expansion comes to a close. We also estimate
Sanxing's operating cash flow will increase modestly to RMB350 million–RMB550 million backed by improved
inventory turnover with increasing preorder sales to corn oil and aluminum clients. The resulting marginally positive
discretionary cash flow of RMB100 million–RMB200 million will keep the company's total debt stable in 2019-2020.
Our sensitivity analysis shows Sanxing has rating headroom for an additional RMB800 million for capex or acquisition.
Our base-case assumes the company's total debt will remain RMB8.0 billion–RMB8.3 billion in 2019-2020, including a
balance of external guarantees of RMB500 million-RMB600 million.

Liquidity: Less than adequate
We assess Sanxing's liquidity as less than adequate, due to its sizable maturing debt. The company's sources of
liquidity are likely to cover its needs by 1.0x over the 12 months ending June 30, 2020.
Sanxing may not be able to absorb certain low-probability but significant risks, such as simultaneous credit distress of
all guaranteed external debt. Although its external guaranteed debt only represents 8% of its total debt, such credit
distress will likely tighten the company's liquidity. That's given its high short-term debt (RMB3.9 billion) relative to its
cash balance of RMB2.3 billion as of June 30, 2019.
Diverse funding sources mitigate Sanxing's liquidity risk. The company has reasonable access to domestic capital
markets, as indicated by its issuance of three-year notes in August 2019. Sanxing has sound relationships with onshore
local banks, given its low bank finance cost of about 5.5%.

Sanxing's U.S. dollar bond has no financial covenants, and the company has adequate covenant headroom on its bank
loan. We estimate Sanxing will still be compliant with its covenant even after a 30% decline in EBITDA. Meanwhile,
the company's onshore public bonds have cross-default guarantee.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
As of June 30, 2019, Sanxing has about RMB1,07 billion in senior secured debt, about RMB2.5 billion in senior
unsecured debt at the operating subsidiaries level, and about RMB4.9 billion in senior unsecured debt at the parent

level.

Analytical conclusions
We rate Sanxing's guaranteed senior unsecured notes at 'B+', the same as the issuer credit rating on the company. The
parent guarantee provided by Sanxing to Knight Castle Investments Ltd., a wholly owned financing subsidiary, is
unconditional and irrevocable, and therefore qualifies for rating substitution treatment, in our view. In addition, we
believe the risk of subordination is not significant because the company's priority debt ratio is only 42%, less than our
50% threshold for notching down the issue rating.
