Overview
Key Strengths

Key Risks

Strong market positions in key markets along with a broad geographic scale, and
excellent product diversity.

Low order-book visibility and exposure to cyclical
end-markets.

Above-average margins for the building materials sector.

Organic growth may slow due to a more unpredictable
macro environment.

High barriers to entry due to strong brand recognition and a technologically
advanced product line.

Acquisition of lower margin businesses may slightly dilute
strong profitability.

Robust free operating cash flow, sufficient to finance bolt-on acquisitions and
dividend distribution.
Strong liquidity.

We believe that Legrand has the capacity and willingness to preserve a strong balance sheet, which supports our rating.
S&P Global Ratings expects that Legrand will maintain sound performance and gradually reduce financial leverage
over the coming two years, which underlines the company's solid balance sheet policy. Legrand uses the majority of its
free operating cash flow (FOCF) to finance its bolt-on acquisitions, while shareholder remuneration remains
conservative, which we view as positive. Legrand also has higher discretionary cash flow (DCF) to debt than peers,
since most peers have large share buyback programs, for example Saint Gobain, CRH, and Schneider Electric. Under
our base-case scenario, we believe that Legrand will be able to slightly deleverage and we anticipate funds from
operations (FFO) to debt will be 37%-40% for 2019-2020.
Stable and strong profitability demonstrates the resilience of Legrand's business. Legrand's strong market position and
pricing power support its consistent above-average margins. We expect the adjusted EBITDA margin will slightly
decline in 2019 due to acquisitions of lower-margin businesses, such as Netatmo, a French smart home company
specialized in the internet of things (IoT) products. Legrand remains exposed to the rise in U.S. customs duties. We
understand it has been able to pass through to customers the tariff impact, and anticipate that it will continue to do so,
or may implement mitigating measures, albeit with a potential time lag.
Legrand sets new targets for its connected products and digital infrastructure. In June 2019, Legrand presented its
strategy on IoT development. Legrand rapidly expanded in connected products over 2014-2018 through its Eliot
program, which now represents more than 10% of the company's sales. Its digital infrastructure also expanded

SEPTEMBER 16, 2019 3

Legrand S.A.

strongly, in particular data centers. In our view, Legrand has been able to build strong market shares in this segment
while maintaining its profitability, which supports the business risk profile. It met its 2014-2020 target for Eliot in 2018.
Legrand now targets to post at least 10% organic growth and €1 billion of sales per year starting from 2022.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our view that Legrand will continue to generate robust, stable EBITDA margins, and
material FOCF, which it will use to finance its acquisitions, while maintaining FFO to debt comfortably above 37%.

Downside scenario
We could lower the ratings if the group experienced weaker operating results and cash flows than we expect, such
that adjusted FFO to debt fell below 37% on a prolonged basis. Rating pressure could also stem from more
aggressive debt-funded acquisitions and shareholder payouts, which would imply a change in financial policies.

Upside scenario
We could raise the ratings if Legrand posted FFO to debt significantly above 45%. If this happened, we would look
at the company's capacity and willingness to maintain a more conservative financial policy with fewer debt-funded
acquisitions or less generous shareholder returns, assuming that the group sustained its operating performance in
line with our base-case expectations. In our view, this scenario is unlikely over our two-year outlook horizon.

Assumptions

• GDP growth in Europe of 1.3% in 2019 and 1.8% in
2020, and around 2.4% and 1.7% in North America.
In Asia-Pacific, GDP growth of 5.1% in 2019 and
5.3% 2020.
• About 7%-9% annual revenue increase in 2019,
mainly supported by external growth (about 5%
impact), and organic growth of about 2%-3%.
• Revenue growth exceeding 5% from 2020.
• Adjusted EBITDA margins of about 23%, slightly
reducing by about 0.5% in 2019, mainly due to the
integration of acquired entities (40 basis points).

• Shareholder remuneration of about €400
million-€450 millions.

Base-case projections
Legrand continues its rapid revenue growth. This is supported by Legrand's mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity,
which should boost sales by 5% in 2019. We also expect organic growth of 2%-3% in 2019, in line with management's
guidance. For the second quarter, organic growth was lower than expected, at around 1.5%, mainly due to a tough
comparison in Turkey and India, and the economic environment in the Middle-East. For the first six months of the
year, organic growth was 2.2%. That said, operating margins remained solid, and the company reported strong
operating cash flows. Our forecasts for 2019 are broadly unchanged.
Financial policies to remain unchanged. Our base-case scenario factors in our assumptions of an unchanged financial
policy. We assume that Legrand will continue using the majority of its FOCF to finance its bolt-on acquisitions instead
of shareholder remuneration. From 2019, we assume cash outflows due to M&A of about €400 million-€500 million.

Company Description
Legrand is a global specialist in electrical and digital building infrastructure. The company manufactures products and
systems for low-voltage electrical installation and data networks. It has about a 6% share of a very fragmented global
market that is worth more than €100 billion. The group serves residential (about 40% of sales in 2018), tertiary (55%,

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 16, 2019 5

Legrand S.A.

including systems and products destined for the private and public sectors), and industrial (5%) building markets. With
a presence in close to 90 countries and a workforce of over 38,000 employees, Legrand reported 2018 sales of about
€6.0 billion. Legrand is listed on Euronext Paris and is a component stock of the CAC40 index. As of August 2019, it
had a market capitalization of about €16.5 billion.

Business Risk: Strong
Legrand's wide product and geographic diversity, solid competitive position with leading market shares in most of the
company's markets in a highly fragmented industry, and above-average EBITDA margins for the building materials
sector support our view of its strong business risk profile. The group benefits from a technologically advanced product
line, strong brand recognition, limited price sensitivity and longstanding relationships with key local distributors.
Market-leading products (No. 1 or No. 2 positions) accounted for 69% of its sales in 2018. In our view, this will help
Legrand maintain its current profitability above the peer average, despite some pressure on margins coming from
increasing raw materials costs. Apart from wide geographic diversity and its presence in markets with positive growth
fundamentals, such as the U.S. and Western and Southern Europe, Legrand has a fairly balanced exposure to cyclical
new-build and the more stable repair, maintenance, and improvement segments of the market--providing respectively
about 52% and 48% of revenues and good end-market diversity.
Over 2013-2018, the company expanded sales by around 35% (6% compound average growth rate). It diversified its
activities outside of Europe, with North America now accounting for 30% of sales. We expect that, with the acquisition
of Universal Electric, a U.S. supplier of power distribution systems, in February 2019, the weight of U.S. sales may rise
further in 2019.

Legrand S.A.

Chart 1

Legrand is also enriching its product offerings in digital infrastructure and home and tertiary automation. These
industries now represent 28% of the company's sales. We note the rapid expansion in digital infrastructure, particularly
data centers, which has been possible notably through its recent acquisitions such as Universal Electric. Regarding its
Eliot program, Legrand has stated that it targets at least 10% organic growth per year and €1 billion of sales in 2022 in
connected products. In our view, Legrand has been able to build strong market shares in that segment while
maintaining its profitability, which support our strong business risk profile.
We note that Legrand has been able to maintain stable operating margins over the years, which shows its ability to
control its operating costs and to pass through price increases. We expect that Legrand will maintain its above-average
operating margins based on its good track record of successfully integrating acquisitions and capitalizing on efficiency
gains.
Legrand also offers an extensive and technologically advanced product line and benefits from economies of scale. We
believe its advanced product base should meet future demand for energy-saving applications and comply with tighter
security regulations. Products and systems for electrical installations make up only a small part of the total final cost to
end-users, which allows Legrand to raise prices.
On the other hand, our view of Legrand's business profile is constrained by the group's smaller size compared with

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 16, 2019 7

Legrand S.A.

global peers, limited visibility of its order book, and some end-market cyclicality. About 80% of the group's sales are
subject to short-term-flow orders related to building activity. There is also some client concentration risk, given that
two customers--the large international distributors Rexel S.A. and Sonepar--together account for 18% of sales in 2018.
However, Legrand benefits from longstanding relationships with key local and large product distributors due to its
large share of the market.

We compare Legrand with large global companies that are either building materials providers or have divisions that
compete directly with Legrand's business. Of this peer group, Legrand is one of the smallest issuers and is more
exposed to the cyclical building activity. On the other hand, Legrand displays higher and less volatile EBITDA margins
than peers, reflecting its leading positions in most of its markets, its ability to pass through price increases, and its
ability to develop value-added products. While Legrand's FFO to debt is in line with peers', we note that its DCF to
debt is the highest among the peer group, reflecting its conservative distribution policy and the absence of a share
buyback program.

Legrand S.A.

Chart 2

Financial Risk: Intermediate
We expect Legrand will maintain its above-average operating margins, but that FFO to debt will remain below 45%
over the coming two years.
After the large debt-funded acquisition of Milestone, Legrand's leverage peaked in 2017-2018 and we now expect the
group will gradually improve these credit metrics, on the back of solid performance and robust FOCF of more than
€800 million per year. In addition, this improvement is supported by our view that, over the rating horizon,
management is willing to keep a strong balance sheet. For 2019-2020, we forecast adjusted debt to EBITDA of
1.9x-2.1x, FFO to debt of 37%-40%, and DCF to debt of about 15%.
Over the past 10 years, Legrand has spent an average of €382 million per year on acquisitions. In our base case, we
assume €400 million-€500 million of cash outflows from bolt-on acquisitions. Following the acquisition of Universal
Electric in February 2019, we anticipate that Legrand's M&A for the second half of the year will be limited.

Our adjusted debt figure is slightly higher than the group's reported net debt figure for 2018. This is because we add
about €200 million related to operating lease commitments, €125 million related to factoring facilities, and €125
million related to pension liabilities. We net about €925 million of accessible cash, which we consider available for debt
repayment. Our forecast credit metrics incorporate total lease liabilities of about €300 million following the
implementation of International Financial Reporting Standard 16, as per the company's disclosures.

Liquidity: Strong
We assess Legrand's liquidity as strong, and we forecast that liquidity sources will exceed uses by about 2.3x over the
next 12 months. A large cash cushion, full availability under the €900 million revolving credit facility (RCF) maturing in
2021, and limited debt maturities due in the next 12 months, all underpin Legrand's strong liquidity. In our view, the
company also benefits from solid relationships with banks and generally prudent risk management.

Principal liquidity sources for the 12 months from June 30, 2019:
• Accessible cash of about €1.1 billion at the end of second-quarter 2019;
• Our forecast of unadjusted FFO of about €1,100 million-€1,200 million; and
• Full availability under the €900 million RCF.

Principal liquidity uses for the 12 months from June 30, 2019:
• Short-term debt of about €613 million;
• Our forecast of non-seasonal working capital outflow of about €125 million-€150 million;
• Capital expenditure of about €200 million-€250 million; and
• Dividend payments and share buybacks of about €420 million-€450 million.

Chart 4

Legrand has a lengthy and spread out debt maturity profile, reflecting its refinancing activity over the past few years. In
June 2019, it issued a €400.0 million 0.625% nine-year bond. On the other hand, we note that the group has around
€613 million of short-term debt as of July 2019, consisting mainly of commercial paper.

Covenant Analysis
Legrand's debt instruments available beyond one year are not subject to financial covenants.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

Since Legrand is a manufacturer of electrical and digital building infrastructure, we see less environmental risk than
for heavy building materials and cement companies. Legrand's strong research and development capacity (4.8% of
sales in 2018) and ability to launch new products enables it to cope with regulatory initiatives to increase energy
efficiency in mature markets and to maintain its market shares. Furthermore, its investments, new products, and
acquired businesses, which respond to social megatrends, somewhat lessen Legrand's exposure to the volatility of
the building materials cycle.
We view Legrand's governance as a supporting factor for the ratings, reflecting management's experience and
expertise, and a balance of different stakeholders' interests. Legrand has not been subject to major litigation.
However, in September 2018, the police investigated Legrand's offices, along with the offices of other French
electrical goods' manufacturers and distributors. According to the press, these investigations are related to
suspicions of cartel pricing and corruption. We understand these investigations are ongoing, and we do not embed
any financial impact in our base case, as the necessity of disbursement is currently uncertain.

gradually deleverage based on its increasing activity and solid cash flow generation. Legrand's capital structure
comprises about €2,900 million of unsecured bonds issued by the parent company and a $400 million Yankee bond
issued by Legrand France in June 2019. The weighted average maturity of Legrand's debt was five years at
end-December 2018.

Analytical conclusions
Given that priority obligations ranking ahead of the senior unsecured obligations account for less than 15% of total
debt (well below the 50% trigger), we align our issue ratings on Legrand's senior unsecured debt with our long-term
issuer credit rating on Legrand.
