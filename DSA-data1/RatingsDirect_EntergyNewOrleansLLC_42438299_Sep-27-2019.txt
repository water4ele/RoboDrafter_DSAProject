Overview
Key Strengths

Key Risks

Low-risk, fully rate-regulated utility concentrated in New Orleans.

Small customer base with modest growth.

Generally stable regulatory framework.

Limited regulatory or business diversity.

About 80% of operating revenues are from residential and commercial customers,
providing stability to the revenue and cash flow.

Susceptible to weather-related disasters.
Negative discretionary cash flow, leading to external
funding needs.

We expect stable cash flows in the coming years, with a consistent customer base consisting of about 80% residential
and commercial customers. It is, however, offset by a concentrated service territory, with almost all of its revenue
generated in New Orleans.
Diverse fuel mix for power generation-- Entergy New Orleans LLC (ENO) owns about 500 megawatts (MW) of natural
gas and fuel oil generating capacity.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on ENO reflects that on its parent company, Entergy Corp. Over the next two years, S&P
Global Ratings' expectation is that Entergy will successfully exit its higher-risk, non-utility nuclear power
generation stations and grow through its lower-risk, rate-regulated utility businesses, leading to an improved
business risk profile. The outlook also reflects our base-case forecast for adjusted funds from operations (FFO) to
debt averaging around 15% over the next few years, in line with the current significant financial risk profile.

Downside scenario
We could lower the ratings on Entergy and its subsidiaries, including ENO, over the next 24 months if the
non-utility-owned nuclear power generation stations, which we currently expect to be closed, remain open and we
anticipate a weakening in its financial measures, including adjusted FFO to debt consistently below 14%.

Upside scenario
Although unlikely given our expectation for weakened financial measures due to the impact of U.S. tax reform, we
could raise our rating on Entergy over the next 24 months if we project that it will improve its adjusted FFO to
debt consistently above 17%.

Entergy New Orleans LLC

Company Description
ENO is a vertically integrated electric and natural gas distribution utility operating largely in New Orleans.

Business Risk: Strong
Our assessment of ENO's business risk profile reflects its operations under a generally stable regulatory environment
by the City Council of New Orleans (NOCC), a small customer base, and limited regulatory and business diversity.
Tariff-setting is characterized by historical test years that can be updated for known and measurable changes, reducing
regulatory lag and supporting operating cash flow and credit quality. NOCC can authorize constructive rate
mechanisms such as fuel and capacity riders that provide cash-flow/financial stability. ENO provides roughly 5% of
Entergy's consolidated revenues and serves a small customer base of 200,000 electric and 105,000 natural gas
customers. About 80% of operating revenues are from residential and commercial customers, providing some stability
to revenue and cash flow. ENO's generation fleet of about 500 MW consists of natural gas and fuel oil. ENO is
constructing a 128-MW, natural gas-fired generating facility--the New Orleans Power Station--for about $210 million.
The station is expected to be operating by mid-2020.

Financial Risk: Significant
Our assessment of ENO's stand-alone financial risk profile incorporates a base-case scenario for 2019-2021 that
includes adjusted FFO to debt of 19%-20%, slightly above the midpoint of the benchmark range of the significant
financial risk profile category. ENO's historical financial measures were elevated due to significantly increased deferred
taxes that started reversing in 2017. We expect the supplemental ratio of FFO cash interest coverage to be 4.5x-5x,
supporting the financial risk assessment. In addition, we anticipate continued capital spending, which, when combined
with the utility's dividend payments, will result in DCF that is negative through 2021. Over the next few years, we
expect debt leverage to be relatively significant for a regulated utility, as indicated by debt to EBITDA averaging about
4.1x. The utility will therefore require external financing or capital infusions from the Entergy group. We assess ENO's
financial risk under our medial volatility financial benchmarks, reflecting the company's lower-risk, regulated utility
operations and effective management of regulatory risk. These benchmarks are more relaxed compared with those
used for a typical corporate issuer.

Liquidity: Adequate
We assess the company's stand-alone liquidity as adequate, because we believe its liquidity sources are likely to cover
uses by more than 1.1x over the next 12 months and meet cash outflows even with a 10% decline in EBITDA. The
assessment also reflects the company's generally prudent risk management, sound relationship with banks, and a
generally satisfactory standing in credit markets.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Estimated cash FFO of about $130 million; and

• Minimal debt maturities;

• Credit facility availability of about $25 million.

• Capital spending of about $125 million; and
• Dividends of about $10 million.

Other Credit Considerations
We assess the comparable rating analysis modifier for ENO as negative, reflecting its vulnerability to hurricanes, a
unique risk characteristic that could stress credit measures.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

We consider environmental factors in our rating analysis. ENO's social and governance factors are generally
comparable with those of its peers.
As both a vertically integrated electric utility with generation assets and a natural gas distribution utility, ENO has
similar environmental risks to those of its vertically integrated peers and Entergy, which has about 21,000 MW of
generation that consists of 65% natural gas, 25% nuclear, and about 10% coal. ENO's gas operations are still
exposed to environmental risks in the normal course of business, as there is a possibility for the company's
pipelines to emit methane.
Entergy continues to decarbonize its portfolio with wind-generation investments, and the company plans to have
1,000 MW of renewable energy resources by 2020, including through power purchase agreements in Arkansas and
Louisiana. By pursuing more renewables generation, the company is meeting its customers' demand for renewable
energy.
Social and governance factors are in line with those of other utility companies.

Group Influence
Under our group rating methodology, we consider ENO as a core subsidiary of its parent Entergy, reflecting our view
that it is highly unlikely to be sold, is integral to the overall group strategy, possesses a strong long-term commitment
from senior management, and is closely linked to the parent's name and reputation. We assess the issuer credit rating
on ENO to be in line with Entergy's group credit profile of 'bbb+'.

Issue Ratings - Recovery Analysis
ENO's first mortgage bonds benefit from a first-priority lien on substantially all of the utility's real property owned or
subsequently acquired. Collateral coverage of more than 1.5x supports a recovery rating of '1+' and an issue rating of
two notches above the issuer credit rating.

S&P keeps certain activities of its business units separate from each other in order to preserve the independence and objectivity of their respective activities. As a result,
certain business units of S&P may have information that is not available to other S&P business units. S&P has established policies and procedures to maintain the
confidentiality of certain non-public information received in connection with each analytical process.
S&P may receive compensation for its ratings and certain analyses, normally from issuers or underwriters of securities or from obligors. S&P reserves the right to disseminate
its opinions and analyses. S&P's public ratings and analyses are made available on its Web sites, www.standardandpoors.com (free of charge), and www.ratingsdirect.com
(subscription), and may be distributed through other means, including via S&P publications and third-party redistributors. Additional information about our ratings fees is
