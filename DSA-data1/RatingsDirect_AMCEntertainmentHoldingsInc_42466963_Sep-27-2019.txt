Largest global movie exhibitor provides a broad customer base with
good geographic diversity.

Exposure to the inter-year volatility of the box office and the success of
the movie release slate.

Its scale also provides increased negotiating power with studios
relative to smaller peers.

Increased competition from in-home entertainment alternatives.
History of debt financed acquisitions leading to high leverage of 6.3x.

We expect AMC's adjusted leverage to remain in the high-5x to low-6x area over the next two years. AMC's history of
debt-financed acquisitions and the significant cash spending requirements of its reseating initiatives contributed to its
high leverage and slow pace of deleveraging over the past two years. We expect adjusted leverage to remain elevated
in 2019 and gradually declining over the next two years due to moderate EBTIDA growth and cash flow generation.
However, if AMC uses incremental cash flow for shareholder rewards instead of repaying debt, leverage could be
higher than we expect.
AMC recently reduced its capex guidance, which could weaken its competitive position over the long term. For 2019,
capital spending is expected to be about $35 million to $50 million lower than we previously expected and 2020 net
capex is now expected to decline by $115 million to $165 million. The reduction will provide a short-term boost to free
cash flow, but we view the company's capital spending on high ROI projects (such as re-seating and new builds) to be
a key factor in its growth strategy and reducing capex could weaken its competitive position.
The subscriber base for AMC Stubs A-List, the company's subscription offering, continues to grow, but its long-term
impact on operating performance remains unclear. A-list allows subscribers to attend significantly more showings per
month than they would if they spent the same amount buying individual tickets. The short-term impact of subscription
models has been positive for total box-office attendance to date. However, we believe subscription models could
devalue the ticket, and it is unclear whether they will be accretive to profitability in the long term.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our expectation that while free operating cash flow should improve over the next 12-24
months due to lower capital spending, we expect the company's leverage to remain at about 6x.

Downside scenario
We could lower the rating if the company's leverage increases above 6.5x on a sustained basis as a result of box
office declines or if its competitive position in key markets weakens due to the slow down in the company's growth
capital spending. We could also lower the rating if the company pursues debt-financed acquisitions or shareholder
rewarding activities that increase leverage above our downgrade threshold.

Upside scenario
While unlikely over the next 12-24 months, we could raise the rating if we expect AMC to reduce leverage below
5x. Given the limited cash flow, even factoring in lower capital spending, we expect this would likely require a 15%
to 20% increase in forecasted EBITDA to reduce leverage below our threshold by the end of 2020. An upgrade
would also likely require a track record of substantial debt repayment.

• U.S. GDP growth of 2.5% in 2019 and 1.8% in 2020.
• Eurozone GDP growth of 1.1% in 2019 and 1.3% in
2020.
• Revenue growth of 0.5% to 1% in 2019 due to a
strong film slate over the second half of the year.
Revenues grow 1%-3% in 2020 as investments in
international theater growth and less currency
headwinds offset a weaker box office.
• Adjusted EBITDA margins to decline by 20-40 bps
in 2019 due to elevated film rental costs related to
Avengers Endgame and Star Wars. We expect
EBITDA margins will improve by 60-90 bps in 2020
due to the company's plan to reduce costs by up to
$50 million by reducing overlap in corporate
expenses.

to the reported debt (operating leases, post-retirement
benefits, workers compensation, accessible cash). We
expect the adjustment to reported EBITDA and
reported debt to be around $958 million and $5.3
billion in 2019 and 2020.

• Net capex of about $415 million in 2019, decreasing
to $300 million in 2020.
• Dividends of around $85 million annually.

Base-case projections
AMC's revenue growth is less correlated to GDP growth and more correlated to the overall box office, which is driven by
the quality of the year's film slate. The U.S. box office has grown at a CAGR of roughly 2% since the mid-2000's with
inter-year volatility driven by the success of the release slate. We expect this trend to continue over the next two to
three years. While we believe an economic downturn would have an impact on AMC due to lower consumer spending,
we view the movie theater as a relatively low cost out-of-home entertainment option that has been relatively resilient
in past recessions. A future downturn would likely result in lower spending on concessions per patron and lower
average ticket prices as customers opt to save money by avoiding premium formats.

We expect the U.S. box office to be strong in the second half of 2019, but expect it to soften in 2020 as the film slate is
less compelling. A strong fourth quarter, driven by Frozen 2 and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker should result in 2019
nearing the record highs of 2018 and contribute to revenue growth of 0.5%-1%. The 2020 film slate is more uncertain
and will face tough comparisons against Endgame and Star Wars, although we expect investments in international
theater growth and less currency headwinds will support revenue growth of 1%-3% in 2020.

ASC 842 has no material impact on our view of AMC's leverage or profitability. AMC's adoption of ASC 842 included a
significant reclassification of finance leases to operating leases, which reduced reported EBITDA and cash flows.
However, our analysis views the distinction between financing and operating leases to be superficial and treats all
leases as debt. We adjust our earnings and cash flow metrics for lease expense and we include all lease liabilities in our
debt figure.

Company Description
AMC Entertainment is the largest theatrical exhibition company in the world. As of June 30, 2019, it operated 639
theaters with a total of 8,107 screens in the U.S. and 365 theaters with 2,929 screens in other countries. AMC holds the
first or second market share position in 21 of the 25 largest metropolitan areas of the U.S. and in 12 of the 15 countries
it serves in North America, Europe and the Middle East. It is publicly traded, but Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda
Group Co. Ltd. owns approximately 49.9% of AMC's stock and 74.9% of the combined voting power.

Business Risk: Fair
AMC's position as the largest movie exhibitor globally provides increased negotiating power with studios and suppliers.
AMC is the largest movie exhibitor in the U.S. and has a significant presence in the European market. AMC is also the
largest IMAX exhibitor in the U.S. with 218 IMAX screens, which is nearly double that of its closest competitor. Its
scale provides solid brand recognition and allows it to negotiate better film rental agreements with studios relative to
smaller peers, as evidenced by its ability to improve the film rental costs of the Carmike theaters after acquiring them
in 2016.
AMC faces increased competition from high-quality in-home viewing and the proliferation of streaming entertainment
alternatives such as Netflix and Amazon Prime. High-quality in-home content competes with AMC for its customer's
time spent viewing content. Additionally, the potential widespread release of films to premium video-on-demand
(PVOD) platforms within the traditional theatrical release window or films becoming available for digital purchase
ahead of their DVD availability could hurt AMC's and its peers' long-term performance. However, we believe major
modifications of the traditional theatrical window, particularly as it relates to the highest grossing blockbuster releases,
over the next 12-24 months are unlikely.
Exhibitors have no control over the timing and quality of the upcoming film release slate. AMC depends fully on film
studios for content, which we believes puts them and other exhibitors at a disadvantage against the studios in terms of
bargaining power. The box office has also become increasingly concentrated with tent-pole franchises contributing a
larger percentage of the annual gross. Additionally, Disney's share of the box office has grown considerably due to the
success of Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars combined with its acquisition of Twenty First Century Fox. We believe the
higher concentration in large tent-pole releases will continue to increase the share of admissions revenue that goes to
the studios. However, the movie theater remains the best option for a studio to monetize the considerable investment
required to produce a movie and we believe it is in the best interest of both studios and exhibitors to maintain the
success of the theatrical box office. Disney has been more vocal than other studios in its support for theatrical
exhibition, which is a benefit to the exhibitors, but if Disney's strategy changes it would have a significant impact on
AMC and its peers.
Total box office growth depends more on higher average ticket prices than attendance. If subscription programs limit
exhibitors' ability to raise ticket prices or decrease the amount of higher-priced premium format tickets sold, we
believe they could potentially limit admissions revenue growth. It is also unclear whether exhibitors are able to offset

any admissions decline through increases in concession revenue or the monetization of subscription data.

We view AMC's competitive position as roughly in-line with its peers and the key differentiation between the ratings is
mainly leverage and cash flow. AMC has the highest leverage of its peer group due to its history of debt-financed
acquisitions, but also due to its significant lease obligations. AMC's strategy of targeting high-quality, expensive
locations and financing renovations through build-to-suit leases has resulted in annual lease payments (both financing
and operating) that amount to roughly 17% of revenue. This compares to about 13% for Cineworld and 9% for
Cinemark. In our view, the company's high leverage limits its financial flexibility relative to its peers.
While AMC is the largest global exhibitor, Cineworld has similar scale and competes head-to-head with AMC more
often than Cinemark. Cineworld's U.S. subsidiary Regal Entertainment Group is generally located in key urban
locations and operates with a similar strategy to AMC's legacy theaters. AMC's average ticket price lags Regal by
roughly $1 mainly because of its lower priced AMC classic theaters (formerly Carmike). While the businesses are
similar, Cineworld has lower leverage and better cash flow characteristics.
Cinemark operates with a slightly different strategy than AMC and Cineworld by targeting mainly mid-sized markets in
the U.S. and investing in growing Latin American markets. While it is the smallest of the peer group, it has the highest
attendance per screen (albeit at a lower priced ticket) and has consistently outperformed the box office over the past
two to three years. It has the highest EBITDA margin due to the low cost base and high utilization of its theaters and
has the lowest leverage, which better positions it to continue making investments in its circuit.
Cinemark and Regal have also launched subscription programs in the U.S., although Cinemark's is based on a credit
system and Regal's program is in early stages.
• We view Cinemark's strategy of charging near its average ticket price to be less risky than its competitors' full
subscription model as the number of showtimes a subscriber attends each month has less of an impact on
profitability. We also believe this allows Cinemark to offer a higher discount on concessions, as there is minimal
discounting of the admission price.
• Regal's program is similar to AMC's but does not have a cap on visits and offers a 10% discount on concessions. We
view Regal's program as being the most risky as it is potentially discounting both admission and concessions.
• AMC does not charge a surcharge for premium format tickets, which is giving up potential incremental revenue that
would be contributing to growth in average ticket prices. However, AMC and Regal's programs are more likely to
drive repeat monthly visits as the users need to justify the cost of the subscription.

Financial Risk: Highly leveraged
AMC's history of debt-financed acquisitions and significant cash spending requirements to support its re-seating
initiatives contributed to its high leverage and slow pace of deleveraging over the past two years. We expect adjusted
leverage to remain elevated in the low-6x area in 2019 and gradually decline to the high 5x area over the next two
years due to moderate EBTIDA growth and cash flow generation. In 2017 and 2018, gross capex exceeded reported
operating cash flow and the company relied on asset sales and sale-leaseback transactions to partially fund its cash
spending. Free cash flow should increase over the next 12-24 months as capital spending decreases, but the company
indicated it would likely hold the cash on its balance sheet instead of repaying debt and reducing its interest burden. If
AMC chooses to use its cash to fund shareholder rewards instead of repaying debt or investing in strategies with high
ROI, we believe it would negatively affect its credit quality.

Liquidity: Adequate
We expect AMC's sources of liquidity will exceed uses by more than 3x over the next 12 months and remain positive
even if forecasted EBITDA unexpectedly declines by 15%. We believe the company has solid relationships with its
banks as indicated by the company's recent ability to issue a new term loan and extend the maturity of its revolving
credit facility. However, given the company's already thin cash flow and our view that growth capital spending is
necessary to maintain its competitive position, we believe the company could have difficulty absorbing
low-probability, high-impact shocks without refinancing.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Cash balances totaling roughly $190 million as of
June 30, 2019, net of restricted cash;

• Gross capex of roughly $400 million to $450 million
over the next 12 months;

• Roughly $317 million available, net of letters of
credit, under revolving credit facilities; and

• Cash dividends of about $85 million annually;

• Cash flow from operations of $540 million-$560
million over the next 12 months.

• Minimal annual working capital requirements; and
• Amortization on its term loan of around $20 million
per year.

Debt maturities
As of June 30, 2019, AMC's debt maturities were as follows:
• 2024: $1,235 million

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 13, 2019 10

AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.

• 2025: $600 million
• 2026: $2,590 million
• 2027: $475 million

Covenant Analysis
Compliance expectations
As of June 30, 2019, the covenant was not applicable because there were no borrowings under the revolving credit
facility. Although we do not expect the covenant to be tested over the next year, we expect the company to have an
EBITDA cushion of more than 50%.

Requirements
The senior secured credit facility includes a springing maximum secured leverage ratio of 6.0x when the revolving
credit facility is more than 35% drawn.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

While not currently material to our rating, we believe motion picture exhibitors are exposed to social and cultural
risks related to the content they choose to exhibit in their theaters. While almost all of AMC's operations reside in
countries with established motion picture content rating systems, the ratings do not completely protect the
theaters from potential backlash related to controversial content. Alternatively, if the theater chooses not to exhibit
politically or culturally driven content, it could be perceived as engaging in censorship. We view AMC's
management and governance as fair which is neutral for the current rating. AMC's largest owner Dalian Wanda
Group reduced its ownership to just below 50% in 2018 but retains voting control through its super-voting shares.
Silver Lake invested $600 million of convertible notes, which would convert to roughly 20%-23% of the equity, to
facilitate Wanda's reduction. Silver Lake has a board seat and a right of first refusal on any further share sales by
Wanda. AMC will have to manage the expectations of its two largest stakeholders, however we believe the
presence of independent board members sufficiently offsets the controlling influence and allows the company to
maintain effective governance.

Issue Ratings - Recovery Analysis
Key analytical factors
• AMC's capital structure consists of a $225 million senior secured revolving credit facility maturing in 2024, a £100
million senior secured revolving credit facility maturing in 2022 (issued by Odeon), a $2 billion senior secured term
loan maturing in 2026, $600 million of senior unsecured convertible notes due in 2024, and $2.3 billion of
subordinated notes with maturities ranging from 2024 to 2027.
• The £100 million multicurrency revolver (not rated) has a priority claim on the company's assets in England and
Wales.

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 13, 2019 11

AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.

• The $600 million convertible notes (not rated) rank junior to the senior secured debt. While the notes could be
converted into equity for $18.95 per share as early as September 2019, our analysis assumes they remain debt since
the company's stock price is currently trading well below that price. If the notes are converted, it would increase
recovery prospects for the subordinated notes.
• The subordinated notes are subordinated to the senior secured and convertible debt.

Simulated default assumptions
• Our simulated default scenario contemplates a hypothetical default in 2022, caused by a significant decline in movie
theater attendance as a result of unappealing films and a sudden and sharp shift toward alternative film delivery
methods.
• Other default assumptions include an 85% draw on the revolving credit facilities, LIBOR is 2.5%, and all debt
includes six months of prepetition interest.
• We assume that in the event of a default or insolvency proceeding the company would reorganize, close
underperforming theaters, and unwind leases. We use a distressed EBITDA multiple of 6x to value the company.

Simplified waterfall
• EBITDA at emergence: about $537 million
• EBITDA multiple: 6x
• Net enterprise value (after 5% administrative costs): $3.0 billion
----------------------------------------------------• Value available to senior secured debt after priority claims: $2.8 billion
• Estimated senior secured debt claims: $2.2 billion
• --Recovery expectation: 90%-100% (rounded estimate: 95%)
----------------------------------------------------• Value available to senior unsecured debt: $754 million
• Estimated senior unsecured debt claims: $609 million
----------------------------------------------------• Value available to subordinated debt: $145 million
• Estimated subordinated debt claims: $2.4 billion
• --Recovery expectation: 0%-10% (rounded estimate: 5%)
