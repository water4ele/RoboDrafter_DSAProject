Overview
Key Strengths

Key Risks

Stable and predictable cash flow, as a majority of its contractual rent is
fixed.

Tenant concentration with , which represents around 78% of cash rental
revenue.

Good asset base with some market-leading properties and barriers to
entry.

Single asset-class concentration (gaming).

High tenant occupancy and long lease terms.

Relatively small asset base.

Ability to use its at-the-market (ATM) equity offering to help maintain adjusted leverage below 5.5x.

We expect Gaming & Leisure Properties Inc. (GLPI) will maintain adjusted leverage of below 5.5x over the long run.
We believe maintaining adjusted leverage of about 5x to 5.5x over the long run is aligned with the company's financial
policy and provides a good cushion relative to our 6x downgrade threshold. We believe that in a scenario where GLPI
pursues an acquisition at a purchase price multiple of 5.5x or above, the company would finance the acquisition
through a combination of debt, cash flow, and equity issuance, to maintain adjusted leverage in the mid-5x area or
below.
We believe GLPI may reduce its tenant concentration over time through acquisitions. We expect that in the next two
years, the majority of GLPI's cash rental income will continue to come from Penn National Gaming Inc. We believe
tenant concentration is a risk factor because tenants can take actions that increase their financial risk, which can
jeopardize their operating performance and stress their ability to maintain good rent-coverage levels. Nevertheless,
GLPI has increased its tenant diversity over the past year through acquisitions of land associated with gaming facilities
operated by Eldorado Resorts Inc. and Boyd Gaming Corp., reducing tenant concentration with Penn to around 78% of
cash rental income, from around 90% previously. We expect GLPI will continue to make future acquisitions, further
reducing its concentration with Penn.
We believe GLPI's good asset quality and limits on competition help mitigate its asset-class concentration. We view
GLPI's portfolio's asset quality favorably because 12 of its properties are leaders in their markets. Asset quality is also
supported by limitations on competition in certain markets, given state-licensing restrictions that limit the number of
gaming facilities in a jurisdiction. This can help support stability in the EBITDA of the operators and mitigate
operators' EBITDA declines in scenarios of declining revenue given less of a need for heightened marketing or
promotions. We also expect GLPI's tenants to maintain rent coverage in the high-1x area over the next few years.

Nevertheless, we believe gaming-concentrated REITs face additional occupancy-related risks relative to REITs that
operate in more traditional sectors, such as retail, in scenarios where the tenant needs to be replaced. This is due to
licensing requirements for gaming operators of the assets.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our expectation for adjusted leverage to remain below 5.5x over the long run, given
GLPI's relatively stable cash flow base and its current financial policy, even incorporating a scenario where GLPI
initially finances an acquisition at a leverage level modestly higher than its planned 5.5x leverage multiple for
acquisitions.

Downside scenario
We could consider lowering the ratings if we expected adjusted leverage would be sustained above 6x over the
long run. Given the cushion we expect compared to this threshold, and GLPI's financial policy with respect to
leverage, a deterioration in leverage to this level would most likely result from a large acquisition, where GLPI is
unable to raise sufficient equity to keep leverage below 6x. We could also consider a downgrade if the credit
quality of GLPI's largest tenant were to deteriorate to the extent that rent coverage fell below 1.5x.

Upside scenario
We believe an upgrade is unlikely over the next few years given GLPI's high tenant concentration and financial
policy to maintain leverage at about 5x over the long run. Nevertheless, we could consider higher ratings if GLPI
significantly increased its tenant diversity and maintained adjusted leverage below the mid-4x area.

Our Base-Case Scenario

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

AUGUST 20, 2019 3

Gaming & Leisure Properties Inc.

Assumptions

• We believe GLPI's revenue is only modestly
correlated with macroeconomic factors since the
majority (83%) of its rental income stream is fixed,
according to provisions of its lease agreements.
Further, we believe operating performance in 2019
at the Baton Rouge property, which GLPI owns and
operates, will be hurt by a smoking ban in that
market that went into effect in June 2018.
• Nevertheless, we believe continued economic
growth will support visitation to, and spending at,
U.S. casinos, which we believe will help GLPI's
gaming tenants maintain rent coverage in at least
the high-1x area. We are forecasting U.S. GDP
growth of 2.5% in 2019 and 1.8% in 2020, and U.S.
consumer spending growth of 2.5% in 2019 and
2.0% in 2020.

• Cash rental income will grow around 13% in 2019
from incremental rent from properties acquired in
late-2018.
• Gaming revenue will decline around 5% to 7% year
over year in 2019 compared to 2018 at the Maryland
property given tax relief granted at the property in
2018 that was subsequently revoked, and due to a
smoking ban at the Baton Rouge property that went
into effect in June 2018.
• Selling, general, and administrative expenses to
decline modestly in 2019 since 2018 included a
one-time charge related to the retirement of the
former chief financial officer.

Company Description
GLPI is a REIT, and acquires, finances, and owns real estate property. As of Dec. 31, 2018, GLPI owned the property
associated with 46 gaming facilities.

Business Risk: Fair
Other business considerations:
• As a REIT, GLPI benefits from stable and predictable cash flows from its tenants - around 83% of GLPI's rental

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

AUGUST 20, 2019 4

Gaming & Leisure Properties Inc.

revenues are fixed per the terms of its lease agreements.
• GLPI also benefits from high occupancy rates (100%) at its properties, which is due in part to the limitations on
competition in certain markets as well as the importance of the gaming tax revenue that these facilities provide to
states.
• GLPI also benefits from long-term leases, with initial terms of 15-years and our view that there is a high likelihood of
renewal (at least for its largest tenant) after the initial term given that the lease assets comprise the majority of
GLPI's largest tenant's EBITDA.
• GLPI has minimal operating expenses since its leases are triple-net, where the operator pays all taxes, insurance,
and maintenance capital expenditures related to the property.

Peer comparison
Compared with other gaming-focused REITS such as VICI Properties Inc. and MGM Growth Properties LLC, GLPI
owns the largest portfolio of assets and benefits from the most tenant diversity. However, GLPI's portfolio lacks assets
in destination-focused markets (Las Vegas), and its total real estate value, as reported on the balance sheet, is the
smallest among the gaming REITs.

Financial Risk: Intermediate
We generally expect GLPI to maintain adjusted leverage in the mid-5x area or below, incorporating acquisitions,
because that is the level that aligns with their financial policy, and since we believe itcan use its increasing cash flow
base and equity program to help fund acquisitions. However, we believe that in a scenario where GLPI's stock price
falls modestly, it might finance acquisitions at a leverage multiple higher than 5.5x initially, but this would likely not
lead to total adjusted leverage sustained above 6x. Furthermore, given the lack of amortization under GLPI's term
loan, and the company's tax status as a REIT (GLPI is required to distribute about 80% of its adjusted funds from
operations, as measure by the company, to shareholders), we believe it will use any available free cash flow to help
fund future acquisitions in lieu of optional debt reduction. GLPI is highly reliant on the health of debt and equity
markets to finance acquisitions because it has less flexibility to sell assets to fund acquisitions than other REITs. This is
because of the master-lease structure with its tenants and because buyers of gaming assets must be licensed in the
jurisdiction where the asset is located.

Liquidity: Adequate
We view GLPI's liquidity position as adequate over the next 12 months because we expect liquidity sources to exceed
uses by at least 1.2x, and net liquidity sources to remain positive, even if our forecasted EBITDA unexpectedly
declines by 10%. We believe GLPI's liquidity position is also supported by its ability to access capital through its sound
banking relationships and satisfactory standing in credit markets, as its ability to secure financing for prior large
acquisitions, refinance maturities, and issue equity through its ATM program, demonstrate. GLPI does not have any
debt maturities until November 2020, when $500 million of its 4.875% senior unsecured notes are due (assuming the
company is successful at tendering at least $500 million of the total $1.0 billion principal).

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

AUGUST 20, 2019 7

Gaming & Leisure Properties Inc.

Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• On June 30, 2019, GLPI had $24.7 million of cash on
hand and $835 million of availability under its $1.175
billion revolver.

• Minimal capital expenditures, since GLPI's tenants
are responsible for property capital expenditures.

• Stable and relatively predictable operating cash flow
averaging $740 million annually through 2020.
• Access to its at-the-market (ATM) equity offering
program. As of June 30, 2019, the company had
$213.7 million remaining for issuance under its $400
million ATM program.

• Significant levels of dividends, at about 80% of
adjusted funds from operations, as measured by the
company. This translates into dividends of around
$585 million to $590 million in 2019 and around the
same level in 2020.

Covenant Analysis
GLPI's credit facility and notes contain typical REIT financial maintenance covenants, including a maximum secured
debt to total assets ratio of 0.4x, a maximum total debt to total asset ratio of 0.6x, and a maximum total debt to
unencumbered asset ratio of 0.6x. GLPI is also subject to a minimum fixed-charge coverage ratio of 1.5x. We believe
the company will maintain adequate cushion with respect to these covenants.

Issue Ratings - Recovery Analysis
Key analytical factors
• Our simulated default scenario contemplates a default in 2023, driven by a significant deterioration in its largest
tenants' operating results.
• We assume GLPI uses proceeds from its recently issued $1.1 billion in senior unsecured notes to: redeem $500
million of its existing $1.0 billion 4.875% senior unsecured notes due 2020, repay outstanding revolver balances
($340 million outstanding on June 30, 2019), and to repay around $240 million of borrowings under the company's
term loan A-1 facility.
• We assume that Penn National, the company's largest tenant, experiences significant deterioration in cash flows,
reflecting prolonged economic weakness, greater competitive pressures, and reduced interest in gaming as a form of
entertainment. We also assume that Penn National continues to make rent payments to GLPI, but given its financial
position, S&P Global Ratings assumes that Penn National is able to renegotiate and meaningfully reduce its rent
payments, even though the current lease agreement does not provide for this.
• We generally cap our recovery ratings on unsecured debt at '3' (50%-70% recovery expectation) for corporate
entities in the 'BB' category. This is to account for the greater risk of recovery prospects being impaired by the
issuance of additional secured or pari passu debt prior to default. However, for REITs with unsecured debt that have
recovery prospects of at least 70% and with more restrictive REIT financial covenants in their unsecured loan
documents, we cap our unsecured recovery ratings at '2'. These covenants include a maximum unsecured debt to

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

AUGUST 20, 2019 8

Gaming & Leisure Properties Inc.

unencumbered asset ratio, or a minimum unencumbered assets-to-unsecured debt ratio. We believe these
covenants would help preserve value for unsecured lenders in the event of a default because they would restrict the
amount of additional debt a company can incur.
• We use an income capitalization approach in our recovery analysis and assume that GLPI is reorganized or sold as a
going concern. We use an approximate 13% distressed capitalization rate.
• We assume GLPI's revolving credit facility would be 60% drawn at the time of default. We believe that GLPI would
be able to cover most of its debt service and other capital requirements despite the assumed lower rent payment
from Penn National. As a result, we assume that revolver borrowings are used to finance an acquisition at an
assumed average 8% capitalization rate.
• We value GLPI based on EBITDA of about $792 million at emergence. This reflects an approximately 30% stress to
our forecasted EBITDA, and incorporates our assumed EBITDA from acquisitions.
• We also assume additional property costs of 5% reduce GLPI's gross recovery value. These costs reflect added
costs that GLPI could incur as a result of its tenants being in financial distress.
• We assume administrative claims total 5% of gross recovery value after property costs.

Simplified waterfall
• EBITDA at emergence: $792 million
• Blended capitalization rate: 13.1%
• Gross recovery value: $6.0 billion
• Net recovery value (after 5% additional property costs and 5% administrative expenses): $5.4 billion
• Estimated senior unsecured claims: $6.8 billion
• Value available for senior unsecured claims: $5.4 billion
• --Recovery expectation: 70%-90% (rounded estimate: 80%)
Note: All debt amounts include six months of prepetition interest.
