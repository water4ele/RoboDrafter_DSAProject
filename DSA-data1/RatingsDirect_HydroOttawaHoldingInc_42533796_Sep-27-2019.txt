Lacks operational diversity because it only operates in the City of

Energy Board (OEB), to sustain its credit quality.

Unregulated cash flow is backed by quality contracts. Hydro Ottawa Holding Inc. (HOHI) generates about 20% of its
cash flow from its unregulated generation. Although we view unregulated power generation as higher risk, this
segment features long-term contracts, favorable terms, and creditworthy counterparties that partially mitigate risk and
provide HOHI with stable cash flows.
The company has large capital spending plans over our outlook period. HOHI continues to execute its large capital
program of about C$260 million through 2019, which includes the refurbishment of two hydro facilities and the
construction of a new headquarters. This capital spending will pressure the company's credit metrics through 2020.
HOHI lacks geographic and regulatory diversity. HOHI serves the City of Ottawa, which is the capital of Canada, and
has a diverse customer base that mainly consists of residential customers, small businesses, and entities in the MUSH
sector. We consider the province of Ontario to be a relatively strong regulatory jurisdiction, which supports our
excellent assessment of the company's business risk. However, compared with other utilities, HOHI lacks geographic
and regulatory diversity, making it reliant on the OEB to sustain its credit quality.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on HOHI reflects the predictable and stable cash flow we expect the company to generate from
its low-risk, regulated distribution business over our two-year outlook horizon. The outlook also reflects the stable
cash flow from the utility's unregulated renewable power generation operations, which are backed by strong
purchase power agreements (PPAs). For fiscal year 2019, we expect HOHI's credit metrics to remain weak, with
funds from operations (FFO) to debt of about 9.5%, because of delays in the refurbishment of its hydro assets due
to weather and its large capital programs. We expect the company's credit metrics to recover in 2020-2021 with
FFO to debt of about 10.5%-11.0%.

Downside scenario
We could lower our rating on HOHI over the next 12-24 months if the company's credit metrics deteriorate and its
FFO to debt falls below 10% with no prospects for improvement. This could occur if the utility experiences any
material adverse regulatory decisions, substantial delays, or cost overruns related to the refurbishment of its hydro
assets or if it undertakes additional acquisitions that it funds with a material level of debt. Alternatively, additional
growth in HOHI's unregulated power business could weaken the company's business risk profile, potentially
leading us to lower our rating. However, we do not expect this to occur during our outlook period.

Upside scenario
Although unlikely, we could raise our rating on HOHI over the next 12-24 months if the utility improves its
financial position, causing its FFO to debt to approach 15%. This could occur if the company earns
better-than-forecast returns or deleverages its balance sheet. Alternatively, we could raise our rating if HOHI's
share of sustained, unregulated cash flow relative to its regulated cash flow decreases.

Company Description
HOHI is wholly owned by the City of Ottawa and governed by an independent board of directors appointed by its
shareholder. The company's core businesses are electricity distribution, renewable energy generation, and energy
conservation and management services. HOHI owns and operates three subsidiary companies.
Hydro Ottawa Ltd. (HOL) is a regulated electricity distribution company operating in the City of Ottawa. It is the
third-largest municipally owned electrical utility in Ontario serving approximately 340,000 customers.
Portage Power (PP), formerly known as Energy Ottawa, is the largest municipally owned producer of green power in
Ontario. PP has installed capacity of about 128 megawatts (MW) and owns and operates six run-of-the-river
hydroelectric generators at Chaudiere Falls. In addition, the company also holds interests in two landfill gas-to-energy
joint ventures.
Envari Holdings Inc. (EHI) is a provider of commercial energy management services. EHI delivers energy solutions for
its large commercial, industrial, municipal, and utility clients.

Business Risk: Excellent
Our assessment of HOHI's business risk profile largely reflects its low-risk electricity distribution operations and our
view of its management of regulatory risk.
The utility continues to operate under a supportive regulatory regime. The OEB, the regulator for the Province of
Ontario, continues to provide a transparent, consistent, and independently operated regulatory framework that

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 25, 2019 4

Hydro Ottawa Holding Inc.

supports a stable and predictable cash flow model, which we view as a key credit strength. The regulatory framework
also limits the utility's exposure to commodity risk and the associated cash flow volatility because the tariff structure
allows it to recover the full cost of purchased power from its customers. The tariff structure also allows the operator to
recover prudently spent operating costs, capital expenditure, or other unexpected material losses in a timely manner.
Further supporting our excellent business risk profile assessment is the utility's diverse customer base with no
significant concentration risk. Residential customers, small businesses, and the MUSH sector account for majority of
the company's customers. In our view, this customer profile is less sensitive to macroeconomic stress and business
cycles.
Even though HOHI generates a material portion of its cash flows (about 20%) from unregulated power (renewable
energy generation), which has much higher industry risk due to fluctuations in energy price, the utility is able to
mitigate this risk through long-term PPA contracts with attractive terms. Most of HOHI's PPA contracts are long-term
with an average length of at least 10 years. Some are also indexed to inflation, which provide the company with a
steady, predictable, and stable cash flow stream. Moreover, HOHI's counterparty in these PPA contracts is the
Independent Electricity Systems Operator (IESO), an agent of the Government of Ontario, which partially mitigates its
counterparty concentration risk exposure. Furthermore, HOHI owns all of the hydro-generation assets at the
Chaurdiere Falls in the Ottawa-Hull region, which gives the company full access to, and control of, the river and allows
it to better coordinate and operate the assets to optimize its cash flows.

Financial Risk: Aggressive
We evaluate HOHI's financial risk profile using our medial volatility financial benchmark tables rather than the tables
we use for a typical corporate issuer, which reflects the company's lower-risk regulated business model and its
management of regulatory risk.
For 2019, we expect HOHI's credit metrics to be weak because its capital programs will be larger than expected due to
the timing of capital programs and increased costs. In addition, the company temporarily shut down some hydro
assets and delayed its hydro refurbishment projects due to weather conditions in early 2019. We now expect that
HOHI will complete the refurbishments in the first half of 2020 rather than by year-end 2019. We also expect the utility
to file for recovery of the increased capital costs in its next rate application. Under our base-case scenario, which
assumes capital spending of about C$260 million in 2019 and C$135 million in 2020 and dividends of about C$22
million in each year, we expect HOHI to have FFO to debt of about 9.5% in 2019. In 2020, we expect the company's
FFO to debt to improve to about 10.5%.

Liquidity: Adequate
We assess HOHI's liquidity as adequate. We expect the company's liquidity sources to be more than 1.1x its uses over
the next 12 months and anticipate that its net sources would remain positive even if its EBITDA declined by 10%. In
our view, HOHI has sound relationships with its banks and a generally satisfactory standing in the credit markets. In
the unlikely event of liquidity distress, we expect the company to scale back on its capital spending to preserve its
credit metrics.

Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Cash of about C$20 million as of March 31, 2019;

• Debt maturities of about C$150 million, including
short-term debt;

• Cash FFO of about C$130 million; and
• Availability under its undrawn committed facilities
of about C$70 million as of March 31, 2019.

• Capital spending of about C$260 million; and
• Dividends of about C$21 million over the next 12
months.

Debt maturities
HOHI has no long-term debt maturing between 2019 and 2023.

Other Credit Considerations
Overall, we assess HOHI's business risk profile as being at the stronger half of the excellent range compared with those
of its peers. Specifically, the utility's PPA contracts in its unregulated business feature above-market rates, long
maturities, and some are indexed to inflation. Furthermore, under the PPAs there is no obligation to deliver electricity
and no minimum production requirements.

Government Influence
Our view of the relationship between HOHI and the City of Ottawa, its municipal owner, remains the same. We
believe there is a low likelihood that Ottawa will provide extraordinary and timely support to HOHI during periods of
financial distress. Although the utility is important to the city, given that it operates the city's electricity distribution
network and is solely owned by the city of Ottawa, the province--not the city--maintains oversight of electricity
regulation, including tariff setting. In addition, an investor-owned entity could undertake HOHI's role, if necessary.
Furthermore, the city does not have any formal policy or track record of providing financial relief or support to the
utility. For these reasons, we view the likelihood of extraordinary government support as low, which does not affect
our rating on HOHI.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
HOHI's capital structure consists of about C$575 million of senior unsecured debt at the corporate level and about
C$500 million of senior secured amortizing debt at the project level.

Analytical conclusions
We rate HOHI's senior unsecured debt 'BBB+', the same level as our issuer credit rating, because its ratio of priority
debt to total debt is less than 50%, which is consistent with our criteria.
