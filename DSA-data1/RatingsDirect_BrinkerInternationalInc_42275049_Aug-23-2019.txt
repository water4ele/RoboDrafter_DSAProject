Key Strengths

Key Risks

Leading casual dining operator and franchisor with scale advantages and geographic
diversity.

Operates in the highly competitive casual dining
restaurant industry.

Significant mix of franchised units (about 33% pro forma for the ERJ Dining acquisition)
provides relative earnings and cash flow stability.

Incrementally aggressive financial policy resulting in
leverage around 4x.

Established operating track record and ability to manage to target credit metrics.

Acquisition of 116 previously franchised Chili's
locations adds execution risk.

Brinker's focus on value, service, and off-premise are driving improving performance at Chili's.
The company's efforts to simplify its menu, execute effective promotions, and invest in food quality have resulted in
five consecutive quarters of positive comparable store sales growth, including traffic trends that have outpaced the
casual dining industry. We expect Chili's recently announced partnership with DoorDash will support sales growth in
2020 as it will extend the company's customer reach and supplement its well-developed curbside business.

Chart 1

Brinker's financial policy has become incrementally more aggressive, narrowing headroom to absorb
a potential downturn in performance.
We expect adjusted leverage will be maintained in the high-3x area over the next 12 months. Brinker generates
consistent cash flow and has used it to pay down revolver borrowings in recent quarters to keep leverage below 4x,
consistent with its track record of effectively managing leverage to within a tight range of its target. Still, we note
limited headroom for potential unexpected meaningful operating underperformance. Moreover, we do not expect
meaningful debt repayment, as we believe the company will return excess cash to shareholders. Going forward, we
expect it to achieve any eventual deleveraging through earnings growth.

AUGUST 19, 2019 3

Brinker International Inc.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our expectation for generally stable operating performance as the company continues
to execute on its customer traffic-driving initiatives at Chili's and Maggiano's. We also expect Brinker will
successfully integrate the recently announced acquisition of 116 Chili's restaurants. We forecast leverage will
remain in the high-3x area over the next 12 months.

Downside scenario
We could lower our rating if operating results weaken, causing credit metrics to erode. This could occur if
competition intensifies or if menu and pricing initiatives at Chili's no longer resonate with guests, leading us to view
the company's market position and operating efficiency less favorably. We could also lower the rating if we expect
leverage to weaken to 4.0x or above, either a result of sustained weakness in operating performance or the
adoption of a more aggressive financial policy.

Upside scenario
Although unlikely in the near term, we could raise our rating if Brinker can deliver consistently positive operating
trends and drive meaningful improvement in credit metrics. In such a scenario, we would expect leverage to stay
below 3x, with a minimal risk of re-leveraging.

Our Base-Case Scenario

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

AUGUST 19, 2019 4

Brinker International Inc.

Assumptions

• U.S. real GDP growth of 2.5% in 2019 and 1.8% in
2020;
• Unemployment rate remains below 4% through
2020, contributing to elevated staffing turnover and
wage pressure;
• Total revenue grows in the high-single digits in fiscal
2020 primarily driven by the acquisition of 116
Chili's locations, supplemented by very modest
low-single-digit comparable store sales growth;

Key Metrics

Based on these assumptions, we forecast the following
key credit metrics over the following 12 months:
• Debt to EBITDA of 3.5x–4x;
• FFO to debt of 15%-20%; and
• EBITDA interest coverage of 4.5x–5.5x

• EBITDA margins decline modestly due to elevated
labor costs and the adverse mix impact of adding
lower-margin company operated stores to the
company's restaurant base;
• Capital spending of around $150 million in fiscal
2020 to support restaurant reimaging, technology
investments, and maintenance spending;
• Free operating cash flow generation of between
$150 million to $170 million.
• No additional debt funded acquisitions.

Base-case projections
Modest organic EBITDA growth despite competitive pressure.
We expect low-single-digit comparable sales will drive earnings growth in fiscal 2020. We also expect EBITDA
margins to compress slightly over the next 12 months as the company's franchise mix declines from the acquisition of
ERJ Dining. Additionally, we see cost pressure from higher labor and commodity costs as a risk to performance, but
expect the company will take measured pricing actions to manage higher operating costs.

Good FOCF notwithstanding temporarily elevated capex.
We expect capex to remain elevated over the next 12 to 24 months as the company implements its reimaging program
across a significant portion of its Chili's restaurant base. We view the cost, estimated around $200,000 per store at the
high end, to be a necessary investment to maintain relevance in a very crowded and competitive market. Despite the
increased spending, we forecast FOCF of $150 million-$170 million in fiscal 2020.

Company Description
Brinker operates and franchises casual dining restaurants under the Chili's Grill & Bar and Maggiano's Little Italy brand
names, generating approximately $4.3 billion in system sales as of fiscal year-end 2018. As of June 26, 2019, the
company owned, operated, or franchised 1,665 restaurants across 30 countries and two U.S. territories.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
Brinker is one of the largest casual dining restaurant companies in the U.S., competing in both the core casual and
polished casual sub-segments of the industry through its Chili's and Maggiano's concepts, respectively. Chili's has a
long operating history and good brand recognition, but lags the industry in restaurant productivity (as illustrated in
chart 3).

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

AUGUST 19, 2019 6

Brinker International Inc.

Chart 3

The company's revamped fixed-price menu offerings has strengthened its image among value-oriented diners, driving
positive customer traffic in fiscal 2019. We believe the company's effective promotions, improving food quality and
service, and growing off-premise business position Chili's to deliver positive comparable store sales growth. However,
persistent promotional activity could stifle menu check growth long-term. Maggiano's has experienced limited growth
in recent years, averaging one new store per year and generating roughly flat comparable-store sales. We believe
Brinker will need to increase square footage productivity through stronger menu innovation and sharper kitchen
execution as well as expand its international presence to drive sustainable earnings growth as there are limited
opportunities for domestic unit growth.

AUGUST 19, 2019 7

Brinker International Inc.

Chart 4

The casual dining industry continues to struggle with an oversupplied marketplace, rising competition from limited
service restaurants, and evolving customer dining preferences. In our view, off-premise (delivery and to-go) sales are
an increasingly important source of transaction growth for the industry. Although Chili's has a solid to-go offering, its
off-premise penetration trails its large casual dining peers due to limited delivery capabilities. Brinker previously
resisted partnering with a third-party delivery service due to high commission costs and point-of-service integration
concerns, but recently announced an exclusive partnership with DoorDash to provide delivery from more than 1,000
of its Chili's locations. We believe the partnership will accelerate off-premise sales and enable Brinker to narrow the
gap to peers.

Brinker International Inc.

Chart 5

Brinker maintains a meaningful franchise business, which provides a favorable margin structure with relative stability
to the company's earnings and cash flow. However, the company's restaurant mix has migrated away from the
franchise model in recent years as it has acquired two large franchisees. Although the operator model affords Brinker
more control over its restaurants' operations and key strategic initiatives, it comes with the expense of greater capital
requirements and higher operating profit volatility. The acquisition of 116 franchised Chili's restaurants from the
company's long-time franchise partner, ERJ Dining, introduces execution risk, but given Brinker's track record, we
believe it will successfully integrate the units.

Selected rated peers for Brinker include Darden Restaurants and Bloomin' Brands Inc. All three companies operate
multi-concept portfolios in the full-service restaurant industry and compete on food quality, service, ambiance, and
price. All three are primarily restaurant operators, but Brinker's mix of franchised restaurants is the most penetrated.
As a result, Brinker has historically generated stronger EBITDA margins than both Darden and Bloomin'.
Although each company operates a national footprint of brands with wide recognition, Darden's scale, concept
diversity, and brand strength exceed that of both Brinker and Bloomin'. However, Brinker has a superior international
presence, franchising more than 380 international Chili's locations, with ongoing expansion into new countries and
territories.
Credit protection measures for Brinker are modestly better than Bloomin's, but lag Darden, which has a track record of
successfully managing its credit metrics consistent with an investment-grade rating profile.

Financial Risk: Significant
Brinker generates relatively stable levels of operating cash flow used for capital expenditures and shareholder returns,
including dividends and repurchases. The company's capital spending needs have generally been lower than its casual
dining peers' due to its mature Chili's footprint in the U.S. and significant franchising mix. We expect capital spending
needs will be elevated over the next 12 to 24 months, however, as the company remodels the majority of its
company-operated Chili's restaurants as well as absorbs the capex needs associated with the purchase of 116
restaurants from ERJ Dining.

AUGUST 19, 2019 11

Brinker International Inc.

Chart 7

Brinker moderated its share repurchases during fiscal 2019, electing to use FOCF to pay down revolver borrowings in
order to maintain leverage within its target range. This is consistent with the company's track record of managing cash
flows and debt pay-down to manage its credit metrics within a tight range that supports the current rating. We expect
it will maintain leverage in the high-3x area and return excess FOCF to shareholders rather than further reduce debt
meaningfully.

Liquidity: Adequate
We assess Brinker's liquidity as adequate. In our view, Brinker has adequate sources of liquidity to cover its needs over
the next 12 months. The company's consistent cash flow generation and availability under its revolving credit facility
support our assessment. We expect that the company's sources of liquidity will exceed its uses by 1.2x or more, and
that Brinker will continue to meet our other criteria for an adequate assessment.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Balance sheet cash of about $13 million as of June
26, 2019;

• Capital spending of around $150 million; and

• Availability under the company's revolving credit
facility; and

• Annual dividend payments of about $50 million to
$60 million .

• Cash flow from operations in the low-$300 million
area in 2020.

Debt maturities
As of June 26, 2019, the company had the following debt maturity schedule:
• $1 billion revolving credit facility, with $110 million due 2020 and $890 million due 2021
• $300 million notes due 2023

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

AUGUST 19, 2019 13

Brinker International Inc.

• $350 million notes due 2024

Covenant Analysis
Requirements
Brinker is subject to a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.5x and maximum leverage covenant of 4.25x.

Compliance expectations
The company was in compliance with all covenants as of June 26, 2019, and we expect covenant cushion to remain
adequate over the next 12 months.

Issue Ratings - Recovery Analysis
Key analytical factors
• We rate the company's senior unsecured notes 'BB+' with a '3' recovery rating, which indicates our expectation for
meaningful recovery in the event of default.
• Our recovery analysis assumes a simulated default occurring in 2024. It is our belief that, for the company to
default, EBITDA would need to decline significantly from recent results, representing a material deterioration in the
economy among increased competition and an increase in the company's operating costs in conjunction with poor
execution of growth initiatives.
• We believe the company's scale and market presence would lead to its emerging from a bankruptcy scenario and
we estimate a gross emergence value of about $1.5 billion, assuming an emergence EBITDA of approximately $253
million and a 6x multiple.
• Although our analysis suggests the possibility of a recovery above 70% on the $350 million notes due 2024, we have
capped our recovery rating on this debt at '3', which indicates a recovery of 50%-70%. This reflects our practice of
capping unsecured recovery ratings on debt issued by companies that we rate in the 'BB-' or higher category at '3' to
reflect the heightened risk that such companies may change their capital structure in ways that could impair
unsecured recovery prospects.

Simulated default assumptions
• Simulated Year of default: 2024
• EBITDA at emergence: $253 million
• Implied EV multiple: 6.0x
• Estimated gross EV at emergence: $1.5 billion

Simplified waterfall
• Net EV after 5% administrative costs: $1.4 billion
• Valuation split % (obligors/nonobligors): 100/0
• Senior unsecured claims: $1.2 billion
