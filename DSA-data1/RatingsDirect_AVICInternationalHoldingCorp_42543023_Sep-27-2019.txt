Key Risks

Diverse business portfolio and product mix.

Intense competition in the high-tech electronics market.

Dominant position in China's aviation products trading and
subcontracting market.

Execution risk in AMOLED capacity ramp up.

Leader in the display and printed circuit board markets.

Large capital expenditure (capex) leading to negative free operating
cash flow (FOCF).

Sufficient and timely support from the Aviation Industry Corp. of China
(AVIC Group).

Diversified business and leading position in core markets to underpin business strength. We believe AVIC International
Holding Corp. (BBB-/Stable/--) will maintain a diversified business portfolio and its core business will see stable
revenue growth in the next 12-24 months. We expect the license restriction on the import and export of aviation
products in China and the company's long operating history to help maintain its dominant position in China's aircraft
parts trading business. We also view trade tariffs to have limited impact on this segment. Moreover, the company's
economies of scale and continuous investment in technology upgrade will also continue to enhance competitiveness in
the high-tech electronics business.

Competition and project execution risk on high-end electronic panel weigh slightly on margin. In our view, AVIC
International faces execution uncertainty in ramping up the active matrix organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED)
production. This is due to the products' complexity that requires time to improve yield rate and hence production cost
will be high at the initial ramp up stage. Meanwhile, the company faces strong competition from international leaders.
Together with uncertain market demand, this will add pressure on pricing and margin. We expect the company's stable
sales on existing panel display products and printed circuit boards to partially temper the pressure.

Debt leverage to edge up in 2019-2020 owing to negative free operating cash flows (FOCF).The company's debt
leverage reduced moderately in the last two years, with the company paying off some debt using proceeds from the
sale of noncore assets. We expect the asset disposal to be mostly complete in 2019 and the cash proceeds to be
limited. We also expect AVIC International to generate large negative FOCF over the next one to two years, mainly
because of sizable capital expenditure (capex) for the expansion in high-tech electronics capacity. As such, we forecast
the company's leverage as measured by debt-to-EBITDA to increase to 8.0x-9.0x in 2019-2020, from 7.8x in 2018.
AVIC International to benefit from timely and sufficient group support. We believe AVIC International will continue to
remain a strategically important subsidiary of AVIC Group. The company was mandated by the group to be the sole
platform responsible for the export and import of aviation products. Moreover, AVIC Group increased the
shareholding in AVIC International in 2018 by purchasing a 28.6% equity stake from minority shareholders to gain
better control on the subsidiary's strategic planning and operations. We believe AVIC International will receive timely
and sufficient support from the group when needed, which leads to a three-notch uplift in our rating on the company.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on AVIC International reflects our expectation that the company will maintain its dominant
position in China's aviation trading and subcontracting market over the next 12-24 months. In our view, the
company's diverse business portfolio could neutralize different sector exposures. We also expect consistent
favorable group support, given AVIC International's strategic importance to the group.

Downside scenario
We could lower the rating if AVIC International's stand-alone credit profile (SACP) weakens. This could happen if:
(1) the company is not able to manage its funding cost or if it pursues aggressive debt-funded expansion such that
the ratio of EBITDA to interest approaches 1.0x or the debt-to-EBITDA ratio deteriorates for a sustained period; or
(2) the company's market position in the aviation and electronics deteriorates, resulting in a significant decline in
profitability.

Upside scenario
We could raise the rating if AVIC International improves its profitability or cash flow such that its debt-to-EBITDA
ratio falls below 5.0x.
We could also raise the rating if support from AVIC Group increases. This could happen if: (1) AVIC International's
asset and earnings contribution to AVIC Group increases substantially; or (2) AVIC Group strongly commits to
providing material and direct financial support to AVIC International.

Assumptions

• China's GDP to grow at 6.2% in 2019 and 2020,
compared with 6.6% in 2018. We expect
government spending on national defense to grow
faster than GDP, supporting AVIC International's
aviation business.
• Revenue to increase by 2%-7% annually in
2019-2020, with revenue growth in core segments
offsetting the impact of noncore business exit.

expansion.
• Proceeds from asset disposal to be RMB2.5 billion to
RMB3.0 billion in 2019.

Base-case projections
Revenue growth supported by double-digit growth in the high-tech electronics business and mid- to high-single-digit
growth in other major segments. We expect revenue in the high-tech electronics segment to grow by 12%-18% in
2019-2020, with the G6 AMOLED line seeing a higher utilization rate and additional volume contribution from new
lines in Wuhan and Xiamen. The aviation segment will maintain a mid- to high-single-digit growth supported by robust
contract backlog. The consumer and retail business will maintain growth in line with China's economic growth. We
also forecast a 5% revenue growth in the international business segment in 2019-2020.
The high-tech electronics business to see lower margin in 2019-2020, dragging down the company's overall margin.We
see intensified competition in the high-tech electronics industry, which exerts downward pressure on pricing.
Moreover, the company's new AMOLED plant will incur higher production costs in the initial ramp-up phase.
Exit from noncore business to bring cash inflow in 2019. AVIC International has gradually exited from noncore
businesses in recent years and we believe its asset disposal will mostly be completed in 2019. According to
management guidance, the company will receive proceeds of RMB2.5 billion to RMB3.0 billion in 2019 in relation to
the disposal of its interests in property subsidiaries and its shipbuilding business.

Company Description
AVIC International is a Chinese conglomerate with businesses in international aviation trading and subcontracting,
technology hardware production, as well as retail and high-end consumer goods. The company was founded in 1979
and is headquartered in Beijing. It is 91.1% owned by AVIC Group.
AVIC Group is a large manufacturer of aviation-related products in China with both commercial and military
applications. It also engages in the manufacture and sale of auto-related equipment and modern services. AVIC Group

is wholly owned by the central State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission.

Business Risk: Fair
AVIC International will continue to benefit from its diversified business model and dominant position in the aviation
parts trading business. We also expect the company to maintain a satisfactory market position in the panels and
printed circuit boards market, but continue to be subject to intense competition due to frequent technology upgrade or
product substitution.
In our view, the strict license control and global-based network will continue to support AVIC International's
dominance in the aircraft parts import and export business in China over the next one to two years. AVIC International
is one of the very few companies licensed to trade aviation products in the country and we don't believe the license
control will loosen in the next few years. AVIC International has a long operating history in the aircraft trading
business and it has built a broad logistics network in major continents. China's aviation industry is still in the
stable-growth phase, with the Chinese government implementing favorable policies to stimulate civil aviation
investments, supporting the demand for aircraft parts. We believe the U.S.-China trade friction will have minimal
impact on the company, given its diversified customer base and small exposure to the U.S. market. In our forecast, the
international aviation business will see stable margin and contribute to over 20% of the company's gross profit in the
next 12-24 months.
We expect AVIC International to maintain its large scale and favorable market position in the high-tech electronics
business in the next one to two years, but to continue facing intense competition. Its indirectly controlled subsidiary
Shanghai Tianma Microelectronics Co. Ltd. (Tianma) is one of the leaders in China's panel industry. Tianma mainly
produces small and midsize LCD and has expanded into AMOLED in recent years to tap into the high-end market. We
expect strong revenue growth for Tianma, with the company further expanding AMOLED capacity. However, the new
capacity ramp-up will lead to higher production costs in the first two years, exerting downward pressure on margin.
We anticipate Shennan Circuits Co. Ltd., which is 69% controlled by AVIC International, to remain the leader in the
printed circuit board industry. The company's domestic printed circuit board (PCB) production line is able to satisfy
both standard and customized specifications with a stable yield rate. It is the supplier to top customers including
Huawei, ZTE, and international communication equipment manufacturers. Overall, we forecast the revenue growth to
offset the impact of slightly lower margin and the gross profit contribution of the high-tech electronics business to
increase to about 30%.
We expect consumer goods and AVIC International's retail business to see stable growth and remain one of the
company's largest profit contributors in 2019-2020, accounting for 30%-35% of total gross profit. The company
operates over 300 shopping centers, supermarkets, and convenience stores in 25 cities in China under the Tianhong
brand. With the popularity of online sales in China, the company is also developing its online business, which is a new
revenue driver in this segment. By the end of the first half of 2019, its online gross merchandise volume reached
RMB1.4 billion--equivalent to a 71% annual growth. In addition, its retail business in luxury watches has maintained
steady growth in the past few years and we expect the trend to remain stable over 2019-2020.

SEPTEMBER 26, 2019 8

AVIC International Holding Corp.

We anticipate the company maintaining the operating scale of its international engineering and construction,
commodity and equipment trading and logistics business. This segment will remain the company's largest revenue
contributor, while generating less than 10% of total gross profit due to the thin-margin nature of the business.
Nevertheless, this business could enhance customer stickiness, given that it provides supplementary services to
customers and helps them save cost.
AVIC International has been gradually exiting noncore businesses to enhance operating efficiency and lower debt
burden. Some of the company's noncore businesses, particularly residential property development, are burdened with
high borrowings. By focusing on core segments where the company has a distinct competitive strength or market
potential, AVIC International could achieve better cost effectiveness. We believe most of the restructure will be
completed in 2019.

AVIC International Holding Corp.

We selected CITIC Ltd. (BBB+/Stable/--) and Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co. Ltd. (Hikvision;
A-/Stable/--) as AVIC International's peers.
Similar to AVIC International, CITIC Ltd. has diversified businesses that range from commodity, engineering and
construction to capital goods.
Hikvision produces surveillance equipment. It's a subsidiary under China Electronics Technology Group Corp., which
is a central Chinese state-owned enterprise (SOE) that has exposure to military products.
Hikvision has a good standing and technology offering for its core product of surveillance equipment, while AVIC
International's association with customers is stronger. This is because Chinese aircraft makers have to rely on AVIC
International to import or subcontract necessary parts, particularly those that other suppliers cannot provide.
Hikvision's FOCF is stronger than AVIC International's with lower spending on capex. Both companies are able to
generate steady profits while AVIC International has higher debt.

Financial Risk: Highly leveraged
We expect AVIC International's financial leverage to remain high over the next one to two years on continuous high
capital spending and hence negative FOCF.
We forecast the company's operating cash flow to improve in 2019-2020 on continuous revenue growth and improving
working capital management. The company incurred large working capital outflows in 2018 in relation to accounts
payable in 2018. We believe this will normalize in 2019 and narrow the net working capital outflow to RMB2 billion to
RMB4 billion, which in our view will partly be in relation to inventory stocking for the new AMOLED capacity launch.
On the other hand, we expect the company to incur higher capex mainly for capacity expansion in the AMOLED
business. The business nature entails considerable ongoing research and development or capital spending, so as to
achieve constant product upgrade and to stay competitive. In our estimate, its annual capex will rise by 60%-80%
annually to RMB14 billion to RMB16 billion in 2019-2020.
While we expect the company to continue to receive proceeds from the disposal of noncore assets, the amount is
RMB2.5 billion to RMB3.0 billion and will be insufficient to cover the gap between operating cash flow and capex. As
such, we expect the company's debt to continue increasing and its leverage as measured by debt to EBITDA to edge
up to 8.0x-9.0x in 2019-2020 from 7.8x in 2018. Higher debt also lowers the company's interest servicing ability. We
forecast AVIC International's EBITDA interest coverage to fall below 2.0x during the period, but to remain comfortably
above 1.5x.

Group Influence
We view AVIC International as a strategically important subsidiary of AVIC Group. We believe the company will
receive timely and sufficient support from AVIC Group when needed. As such, the rating on AVIC International is
three notches above its SACP.
Our assessment of AVIC International's strategic importance to AVIC Group is based on following factors:
• We believe that AVIC Group is highly unlikely to lose majority control in AVIC International.
• AVIC International plays an important role in supporting the group's strategy. The company is the main arm under
the group for expanding its international businesses and being the sole platform responsible for the export and
import of aviation products. However, AVIC International's revenue contribution to the group's aviation business is
limited.
• We view the group's senior group management to be committed to support AVIC International.
• AVIC International has been reasonably successful in its businesses.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
AVIC International's capital structure as of Dec. 31, 2018, consists of RMB12.8 billion secured debt, RMB86.3 billion
unsecured debt at the subsidiaries' level, and RMB27.2 billion at the parent company level.

Analytical conclusions
We equalize the rating on AVIC International's guaranteed senior unsecured notes to the issuer credit rating on the
company. Although AVIC International's priority debt ratio is above the 50% notching threshold, we do not notch
down the issue rating. This is because we expect extraordinary government support will flow to the company via its
parent, AVIC Group. As such, structurally subordinated lenders would not have weaker recovery prospects than other
senior lenders.
