Market leader in providing Spanish-language content in the U.S.

Elevated leverage in the mid-7x area.

38% of revenue comes from subscription revenue, which is more stable than volatile
advertising revenue.

Increasing competition for Hispanic viewers.

Healthy free operating cash flow (FOCF) generation supports deleveraging.

Lower advertising rates compared to English-language
peers.

We expect S&P Global Ratings' adjusted leverage will decline to 7.4x-7.6x in 2019 with further improvement to
6.5x-6.7x in 2020. We expect leverage will improve in 2019 primarily due to EBITDA growth resulting from the roll-off
of restructuring costs, which were in excess of $100 million in 2018. We expect limited EBITDA growth in 2020, such
that leverage reduction will primarily be the result of voluntary debt repayment.
Univision is the market leader in providing Spanish-language television and radio in the U.S. Univision's television
network reaches 83% of U.S. Hispanic television households and its portfolio garners 53% of all Spanish-language
viewing. This makes Univision an important medium for advertisers and video service distributors trying to reach
Spanish-language consumers.
Competition is increasing for Hispanic viewers. Univision's market share has eroded from viewers migrating to other
Spanish-language networks like Telemundo and to streaming video providers like Netflix. The percentage of U.S-born
Hispanics, which are more likely to watch English-language programming, has also grown over the past decade.
Univision, like English-language networks, is susceptible to increasing audience fragmentation, particularly as the
Hispanic population is the country's youngest demographic, which is more open to exploring nontraditional forms of
media.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our expectation that leverage will improve to the mid-7x area in 2019, with further
improvement to the mid-6x area in 2020, as revenue and EBITDA stabilize and the company uses its FOCF to
repay debt.

Downside scenario
We could lower the rating if leverage remains above 8x and FOCF to debt falls below 3% on a sustained basis. This
could occur if the company loses market share to other networks or over-the-top (OTT) alternatives, or if there is
an economic downturn that causes advertisers to pull back on television and radio advertising.

Upside scenario
We could raise the rating if Univision reduces leverage below 6.5x on a sustained basis. This would likely require
improved operating trends, with ratings growth translating to stabilized advertising and subscriber trends, and all
cash flow directed toward debt repayment.

Our Base-Case Scenario

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 20, 2019 4

Univision Communications Inc.

Assumptions

• U.S. GDP growth of 2.5% in 2019 and 1.8% in 2020.
Core advertising (excluding political) revenue is
highly correlated to GDP growth since expectations
for consumer spending drive advertising budgets,
but is negative in election years due to displacement
from political advertising.
• Revenue growth of about 1% in 2019. Revenue
growth is muted because there is lower political
advertising revenue in a nonelection year and
Univision was not carried on DISH in the first
quarter, which weighed on both subscription and
advertising revenue. DISH lost a material number of
subscribers over the past year due to blackouts with
HBO and Univision, scaling back on promotional
discounts, and secular pressure from cord-cutting.

• Revenue growth of 2%-3% in 2020, benefiting from
higher political advertising revenue given the U.S.
presidential election and advertising revenue
associated with Union of European Football
Associations championship. There will be limited
incremental benefit in 2020 from Univision's new
contract with DISH since Univision will have nine
months of revenue from DISH subscribers in 2019.
• Expense growth (excluding restructuring) of 1%-2%
in 2019 and 2%-3% in 2020. Expense growth in 2019
is primarily driven by costs to obtain additional
programming rights, somewhat offset by cost
savings from previous restructuring activities.
Expense growth in 2020 is primarily driven by
additional programming costs and license fees to
Televisa.
• Adjusted EBITDA margin improves to 35%-37% in
2019 and 2020 from 33.3% in 2018 due to the
roll-off of restructuring costs, which totaled
approximately $105 million in 2018.
• Working capital outflows of around $140 million in
2019 and $40 million in 2020. The company had
meaningful working capital requirements in the first
half of 2019 related to acquiring sports rights and
regaining carriage on DISH.
• Capital expenditures of around $75 million in 2019
and 2020.

• Univision sold its English-language digital assets in
April 2019. The results of these businesses were
classified as discontinued operations in 2018.

Base-case projections
Subscription revenue will grow around 5% over the next two years. Univision regained carriage on DISH on March 26,
2019, after having been dark for nine months, which will benefit revenue in 2019. However, the new contract excludes
SlingTV (DISH's OTT offering) and DISH has lost a material number of subscribers. While it is uncertain how many
subscriber losses were directly attributable to losing Univision, and some subscribers migrated to other video services
with Univision, DISH lost more than 930,000 subscribers in the nine months without Univision. We expect higher rates
associated with recent contract renewals with video service distributors will drive subscription revenue growth in
2020.
Revenue growth from television advertising will lag GDP growth.We expect flat to 1% core television advertising
revenue growth in 2019 as Univision benefits from regaining carriage on DISH. While Univision's 2019-2020 network
upfront was up mid-single digits, it will not begin to benefit revenue until the fourth quarter of 2019. We expect core
television advertising will decline 1%-3% in 2020, despite growth in the recent upfront, because of political
displacement.
Radio advertising revenue will continue to decline. We expect radio advertising revenue will decline around 4% in a
non-election year and 2% in an election year due to increasing competition from alternative media (primarily internet
advertising).

Company Description
Miami-based Univision is a Spanish-language multimedia company focused on serving Hispanic America. Univision
derives about 90% of its revenue from its 2 broadcast networks, 10 cable networks, 65 television stations, and network
of online and mobile applications and products. The remainder of the company's revenue primarily comes from its 58
radio stations.

Univision is privately owned by a group of financial sponsors (including Madison Dearborn Partners LLC, Providence
Equity Partners LLC, Saban Capital Group Inc., TPG Global LLC, Thomas H. Lee Partners L.P.) and Grupo Televisa
S.A.B., although its financials are public.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
Univision obtains a significant amount of content from Televisa. Univision has a program licensing agreement (PLA)
with Televisa that provides it with a steady pipeline of content. The term of the PLA will continue until the latter of
2025 or 7.5 years after Televisa has voluntarily sold a specified portion of its shares. While Univision does not disclose
the breakdown of its content sources, the majority of its prime time content comes from Televisa, which makes it
particularly dependent on Televisa for its prime time revenue. Univision's relatively low-cost PLA with Televisa
contributes to its high EBITDA margin relative to peers such as CBS.
Univision's ratings have declined for several years, but have begun to improve. Ratings affect a company's ability to
generate advertising revenue and negotiate rates with video service distributors. Univision's ratings declined over the
past couple of years (particularly among its telenovelas, which is principally licensed from Televisa), contributing to
core television advertising revenue declines in excess of 10%. Management has made an effort to improve Univision's
ratings by diversifying its programming (through working with Televisa and by adding other content), resulting in

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 20, 2019 7

Univision Communications Inc.

improved ratings over the past three quarters. We believe this will contribute to stabilizing Univision's core television
advertising revenue in 2019. Univision sells about 75% of its network advertising through its upfront, such that it will
take a few quarters for improved ratings to translate into improved revenue.
58% of Univision's revenue comes from advertising, which is likely to face pressure during an economic downturn. We
view subscription revenue (38% of revenue) more favorably than advertising revenue since it is more stable than
volatile advertising revenue. While Univision's subscription revenue declined 5.4% in 2018 due to losing carriage on
DISH, we expect it will largely recover in 2019 due to a new contract with DISH and renewed contracts with other
video-service distributors. We believe Univision's market leading position as a provider of Spanish-language content
continues to make it a key component of the video bundle, which will support future growth in subscription revenue.

Peer comparison
We view Univision's business less favorably than CBS Corp., Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc., and Nexstar Media Group
Inc. Univision is smaller in size, has a more limited audience (contributing to lower advertising rates), and has
materially higher leverage. Still, we believe Univision continues to be an important medium for advertisers to reach the
Hispanic community in the U.S., which is still a growing demographic.
• CBS is the No. 1-rated English-language network in the U.S. and owns a portfolio of 29 broadcast television stations.
CBS also owns a TV production studio and Showtime (a key cable network) and has an established DTC strategy
with its CBS AllAccess and Showtime Anytime platforms.
• Sinclair and Nexstar are the largest non-network-owned television station groups in the U.S. Sinclair owns more
than 190 broadcast television stations and more than 20 regional sports networks (RSNs). Its recent acquisition of
the RSNs increased its scale and revenue diversity, such that stable subscription revenue now contributes around
70% to revenue. Following the acquisition of Tribune Media Co., Nexstar will own almost 200 television stations
and subscription revenue will represent around 45% of total revenue.
Note: Sinclair's financials do not include its recent acquisition of the RSNs; Nexstar's financials do not include its
pending acquisition of Tribune; and CBS' financials do not include its proposed merger with Viacom.

Financial Risk: Highly leveraged
Univision's leverage is currently elevated. Univision's leverage increased to 8.6x in 2018 from 6.6x in 2017 due to
revenue declines from the loss of carriage on DISH (starting June 30, 2018) and advertising weakness as well as
EBITDA declines due to elevated restructuring costs and a step-up in the PLA rate with Televisa.
We expect all FOCF will be directed toward debt repayment. We expect Univision will generate more than $300
million in FOCF in 2019 that it will use for voluntary debt repayment to reduce leverage to 7.4x-7.6x. We expect FOCF
will materially improve to more than $500 million in 2020 due to a combination of revenue growth, reduced interest
expense, and lower working capital requirements, which it will use for further voluntary debt repayment to reduce
leverage to 6.5x-6.7x.

Liquidity: Adequate
We expect liquidity sources will exceed uses by more than 15x over the next 12 months and that net sources would
remain positive even with a 15% decline in forecasted EBITDA. Given Univision's sizable revolving credit facility and
accounts receivable (AR) facility, healthy FOCF, and manageable near-term debt maturities, we believe Univision
could withstand a high-impact, low-probability event with limited need for refinancing. However, we believe
Univision's previous operating challenges and elevated leverage have weighed on its standing in credit markets.

Requirements
Univision's credit agreement includes a maximum first-lien net leverage ratio covenant of 8.5x.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

We believe Univision primarily faces social risk, including cultural and regulatory issues, related to content. As a
creator of television content, Univision faces the risk if any of its content material is considered offensive or
controversial. Television broadcasters are also required to operate within the broadcast decency bounds set by the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC), or risk fines or the loss of broadcast licenses. The FCC also reviews
applications for foreign investments above 25% in U.S. entities that control broadcast licenses. The FCC approved
a petition in 2016 to increase Televisa's stake in Univision to 49% (although it currently owns about 36%).

Issue Ratings - Recovery Analysis
Key analytical factors
• Univision Communications Inc. is the borrower of a senior secured credit facility (including a $850 million senior
secured revolving credit facility maturing in 2022 and a $4.3 billion senior secured term loan maturing in 2024) and
senior secured notes ($357.8 million 6.75% notes due in 2022, $1.2 billion 5.125% notes due in 2023, and $1.5 billion
5.125% notes due in 2025).
• The senior secured credit facility is guaranteed by Univision Communications Inc.'s material wholly owned
restricted domestic subsidiaries (with certain exceptions) and Broadcast Media Partners Holdings Inc. (its parent)
and is secured by substantially all of the company's assets and those of its guarantors (with certain exceptions).
• The senior secured notes are guaranteed and secured by substantially all of the subsidiaries that guarantee and
secure the senior secured credit facility, although Broadcast Media Partners Holdings Inc. does not guarantee or
secure the notes.
• Univision also has an unrated $400 million AR facility (composed of a $100 million term component and a $300
million revolving component) maturing in 2022, which has a first-priority interest on sold or contributed receivables.

Simulated default assumptions
• Our simulated default scenario contemplates a default in 2022 due to a combination of the following factors:
increased competition from other Spanish- and English-language content providers, a prolonged decline in
advertising revenue due to economic weakness, and financial strain from the company's high debt service
requirements.
• Other default assumptions include an 85% draw on the revolving credit facility, a 60% draw on the revolving
component of the accounts receivable facility, LIBOR is 2.5%, the spread on the revolving credit facility rises to 5%
as covenant amendments are obtained, and all debt includes six months of prepetition interest.
• We have valued Univision on a going-concern basis using a 7x multiple of our projected emergence EBITDA, which
is in line with that of the large television broadcasters we rate.
