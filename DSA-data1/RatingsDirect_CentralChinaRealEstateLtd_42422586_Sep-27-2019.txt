Robust sales and market share growth affirm Central China Real Estate Ltd.'s (CCRE) position as the largest developer
in Henan. CCRE's total contracted sales increased 77% to Chinese renminbi (RMB) 53.7 billion in 2018, achieving
119% of its target. The company has over RMB100 billion in saleable resources, which should ensure continued sales
growth to RMB63.5 billion in 2019. In the first half of 2019, the company's contracted sales reached RMB27.7 billion,
which is 43.6% of its full-year sales target. That said, we expect growth to ease to 10%-15%, in line with slower market
growth. CCRE's sales rose 9.2% year-on-year in January-June 2019. We believe the company will meet its contracted
sales target comfortably as the targeted sell-through rate is only 49%, compared with over 75% in the last two years.
We also expect the attributable ratio to remain at 70%-75% in the next one to two years, compared with 72% in 2018.
CCRE is the largest developer in Henan, having increased its market share to 10.7% in the first half of 2019, from 5.2%
in 2017, while continuing to grow its asset-light business.

High geographical concentration, though sales mix is becoming more balanced. CCRE's exposure remains concentrated
in Henan, though it has substantially improved its geographical diversity within the province in the past two years. The
company now has development projects across 91 cities in Henan, compared with 44 in 2017 and 36 cities in 2016. It
aims to fully cover all 120 cities within Henan in the coming years. The sales mix has also become more balanced,
with its top three cities contributing to 45% of total sales in 2018, compared with 64% in 2016. No single city
accounted for more than 26% of sales.

Consolidated and see-through leverage should improve gradually but remain high. Given CCRE's expansion plans, we
expect its see-through (when joint ventures are proportionally consolidated) debt-to-EBITDA ratio to improve to
4.5x-5.0x in 2019 and 4.0x-4.5x in 2020, from 6.4x in 2018. This is aided primarily by higher revenue recognition from
increased sales and controlled debt-funded expansion. We also believe its consolidated leverage will follow a similar
trend.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our view that CCRE's financial leverage on our adjusted and proportionally
consolidated basis will stabilize in the coming 12 months while the company grows its operating scale. We expect
CCRE to maintain its leading position in Henan as well as its stable sales execution and profitability in the next 12
months.

Downside scenario
We could lower the rating if CCRE's debt-to-EBITDA ratio on our proportionally consolidated basis materially
worsens from our base case of about 6x. This could happen if the company's debt-funded expansion is more
aggressive than we expect, or project execution is delayed.

Upside scenario
We could raise the rating if CCRE shows a deleveraging trend, such that its debt-to-EBITDA ratio on our
proportionally consolidated basis is sustainably below 4x.

Our Base-Case Scenario
Assumptions

• China's property residential sales to increase by
12%-15% in 2019, which is likely driven by a 2%-3%
growth in gross floor area (GFA) and a 10%-12% rise
in the average selling price (ASP).
• CCRE's contracted sales growth to be in line with
the national rate. Total contracted sales, including
contributions from joint ventures (JVs), will
moderately increase to RMB60 billion-RMB66
billion in 2019 and RMB73 billion-RMB75 billion in
2020, from RMB53.7 billion in 2018.

• Sales from JVs to account for 25%-30% of total sales
in the coming two to three years.
• EBITDA margin to remain steady at 20%-22% in
2019 and 2020, mainly because we expect
high-margin projects sold in 2017-2018 to be
recognized.
• Revenue to increase to RMB21 billion-RMB24 billion
in 2019 and RMB30 billion-RMB34 billion in 2020,
from RMB14.8 billion in 2018, driven by robust
contracted sales growth.
• Land acquisition budget of RMB18 billion-RMB20
billion over the next two years, which is relatively
flat compared to RMB17 billion spent in 2018, given
that CCRE targets controlled and balanced growth.
• Construction expenditure to increase to RMB20
billion-RMB23 billion in 2019 and about RMB30
billion in 2020, largely because of its scalable growth
in contracted sales.

Base-case projections
The off-balance-sheet debt at the JV project level will not materially impact CCRE's leverage after proportional
consolidation. By 2019, we expect CCRE to have attributable debt at the off-balance-sheet JV level of RMB4.8
billion-RMB5.0 billion and attributable EBITDA of RMB0.7 billion-RMB 0.9 billion. Therefore we believe leverage at
the JV level will be similar to but slightly lower than that at the consolidated level, consistent with our understanding
that project-level debt is limited to standard development loans. We also do not expect CCRE to guarantee more than
its share of debt at the JV level, unlike in the past. In 2017-2018, CCRE's guarantee to JCE was higher than its
attributable off-balance-sheet debt, which explains the difference between consolidated and see-through leverage.

Central China Real Estate Ltd.

Company Description
CCRE is a China-based property developer that focuses on residential property development in the Henan province.
The company is the largest developer in Henan. It has a market share of 9% in 2018, including its asset-light model
projects. CCRE also has a small presence in cultural tourism projects and hotel operations. It has the longest listing
history compared to its peers from Henan. The company was founded by Mr. Wu Po Sum in 1992. He owns 74.84% Of
CCRE's shares after the second-largest shareholder, CapitaLand, sold the shares back to the chairman.

Business Risk: Weak
CCRE's business strengths include its established market position in Henan, low-cost land bank, improved fast asset
turnover model, and gradually growing asset-light model. High geographic concentration in one province, rising
potential counterparty risks associated with high JV exposure, and the high proportion of sales contribution from
lower-tier cities temper the above strengths.
We expect CCRE to remain the market leader in Henan and continue to benefit from its strong local knowledge and
business networks. For instance, CCRE acquired about 2 million square meters (sqm) of land by project acquisition in
Luoyang, one of CCRE's top five markets, at a reasonable cost, accounting for only 10% of the expected selling price.
Another example is CCRE's fast-growing asset-light business model, where it lends its branding and execution
capability to smaller developers. Total planned gross floor area increased significantly to 16.6 million sqm in 2018,
from 7.1 million sqm in 2016. This would not have been possible without CCRE's established brand name and local
knowledge.
We believe CCRE will gradually regain its presence in Zhengzhou, Henan's capital, where housing demand is more
stable. Zhengzhou, where CCRE bought three pieces of land in the first five months of 2019, accounted for 78% of its
new land acquisition spent during the same period. Zhengzhou contributed 26% of contracted sales in 2018 and holds
around 30% of the company's land reserves. This is also in line with the company's strategic alignment of focusing its
asset-heavy projects only in Zhengzhou, and tier-three and tier-four cities. Its asset-light projects will be targeted for
lower-tier, county-level cities.
We believe the new strategy of employing its asset-light model in county-level cities is a good strategic move to
mitigate risk in such cities, given their less matured markets. In 2018, county-level cities accounted for 30% of
contracted sales and about 27% of its land bank.
We expect CCRE's EBITDA margins to be stable at 20%-22% over the next one to two years, after a jump to 21.1% in
2018 from 17.5% in 2017. This is because recent sales carry better margins; pricing in tier-three and tier-four cities
have surged. The company's average land cost is RMB1,062 per sqm, accounting for only 15% of the average selling
price in 2018. This also offers some buffer for the future.
However, the use of JVs lowers CCRE's financial transparency and visibility from its consolidated figures. We believe
contributions from JCEs are likely to reach 25%-30% of total contracted sales in the next 12 months, along with the

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 9, 2019 8

Central China Real Estate Ltd.

company's geographic shift to enter more tier-three and tier-four cities within Henan. Many of CCRE's JV partners are
reputable developers while borrowings at the JV level are legally non-recourse, except for guaranteed bank loans
(about RMB4.9 billion as of end-2018). However, in the event of distress in JV projects, we believe there is a high
likelihood that partners would have obligations to support their projects and repay the debt. Hence, we continue to
analyze its see-through leverage ratios.
In our view, CCRE's strong cash position somewhat offsets its expansion risk. We believe the company's growing
operating scale, improved fast-churn capability and sales execution, and market leadership in Henan are comparable
to peers with 'B+' ratings. These factors support CCRE's positive comparable rating analysis.

Figures shown are on a consolidated basis; CCRE’s proportional consolidated debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 6.4x in 2018. RMB--Chinese renminbi.
FFO--Funds from operations.

We consider Times China Holdings Ltd. as CCRE's closest peer. We assess the two companies to have similar business
and financial risk profiles. CCRE and Times China are regional players with high concentration in the Henan and
Guangdong provinces, respectively. Their target segments are first-time homebuyers and upgraders.
On the other hand, China Aoyuan Group Ltd., Powerlong Real Estate Holdings Ltd., Yuzhou Properties Co. Ltd., and
China SCE Group Holdings Ltd. have similar geographic diversification, while Times China and CCRE are less
diversified. Times China and CCRE focus on a few key cities in their home market and have little intent to expand
further afield. Others continue to gradually expand beyond their home base.
Compared with Times China, CCRE has slightly lower contracted sales but its project diversification in terms of
number of cities is better. Times China has a comparatively larger scale with contracted sales of around RMB60 billion,
compared to CCRE's RMB53 billion in 2018.
While most peers, including CCRE, had positive free cash flow from operations in 2018 and the first half of 2019,
mainly due to scaled back land acquisition in the second half of 2018 while market conditions were uncertain, CCRE
has less replenishment pressure compared to Aoyuan and China SCE. CCRE has more than four years of land reserves,
while Aoyuan and China SCE have about three years according to our estimates. Among peers, only Times China had
negative operating cash flow last year.
CCRE also has good liquidity, with liquidity sources to uses of over 2.6x in 2019. It has greater flexibility in managing
short-term maturities given that it has close to RMB17 billion cash on hand for short-term borrowings of RMB5.3
billion as of end-2018; this is stronger than most peers.

Financial Risk: Highly leveraged
CCRE's see-through debt-to-EBITDA ratio after proportionally consolidating JVs is likely to improve to 4.5x-5.0x in
the next 12-18 months, from 6.4x in 2018, given our anticipation that sales and revenue growth will outpace that of
debt. CCRE's debt growth is keeping pace with EBITDA growth, and we expect this to improve further.
CCRE is becoming more strategic in acquiring land. It is planning to spend RMB17 billion for new land acquisition in
2019, which is equivalent to about 27% of attributable contracted sales over the same period. This compares to 32% in
2018 and 53% in 2017. During the first five months of 2019, it spent RMB6.5 billion in new land acquisition, accounting
for 40% of its full-year land budget. This pace matches its contracted sales, which achieved 40% of its full-year target

Liquidity: Adequate
We assess CCRE's liquidity as adequate. In our base-case scenario, the company's cash sources will exceed cash uses
by over 2.6x for the next 12 months. Our calculation does not factor in the potential cash outflow for uncommitted
land acquisitions. CCRE also has the flexibility to cut its budgeted expenditure on construction if needed.
We do not assess the liquidity as strong. This is because our cash outflow calculation only factors in committed land
premiums as of the end of 2018 but land payments in the coming 12 months will likely be much higher.

SEPTEMBER 9, 2019 11

Central China Real Estate Ltd.

CCRE has established relationships with banks. Under stressed conditions, the company can also reduce land
acquisitions and slow construction to preserve liquidity.
CCRE has demonstrated satisfactory standing in the credit market in the past few years, which is proven by its tapping
of offshore and domestic capital markets. CCRE has actively managed its borrowing and built up diverse funding
channels. The early repayment of US$200 million in 2018 lowered refinancing pressure in the offshore bond due in
January 2019. In April 2019, the exercised rate of puttable option of its RMB3 billion domestic bond was 50%. While
the issuance of 364-day-notes will weigh on its short-term maturities, the risk is offset by its successful issuance of
three- and four-year notes.

Central China Real Estate Ltd.

Capital structure
As of Dec. 31, 2018, CCRE's capital structure consisted of about RMB10.6 billion in secured bank loans and loans at
subsidiaries (including guarantees at subsidiaries), while the company's reported debt was RMB21.7 billion. As such, its
priority debt ratio is 48%. The senior unsecured notes are ranked equally as its secured debt and subsidiary-level debt,
which together remain lower than 50% of total debt. We, therefore, do not notch down its issue rating.

Analytical conclusions
We rate CCRE's debt at 'B+', in line with the issuer credit rating, given that secured and priority debt are below 50% of
its total debt and there are no significant elements of subordination risk in the capital structure.
