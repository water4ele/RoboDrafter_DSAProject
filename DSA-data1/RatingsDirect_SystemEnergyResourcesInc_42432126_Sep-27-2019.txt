Owner and operator of the Grand Gulf nuclear station. System Energy Resources Inc. owns and operates a 1,272
megawatt (MW) nuclear generating plant, resulting in significant generation resource concentration.
We expect stable cash flows. Strong off-take agreements with affiliates and efficient operations should enable the
company to realize strong cash flows.

System Energy Resources Inc.

Outlook: Stable

The stable rating outlook on System Energy Resources Inc. (SERI) reflects that of parent Entergy Corp. Over the
next two years S&P Global Ratings expects Entergy will successfully exit its higher-risk, non-utility nuclear power
generation stations and grow through its lower-risk rate-regulated utility businesses, leading to an improved
business risk profile. The outlook also reflects our base-case forecast for adjusted funds from operations (FFO) to
debt averaging around 15% over the next few years, in line with the significant financial risk profile.

Downside scenario
We could lower ratings on Entergy and its subsidiaries, including SERI, over the next 24 months if the
non-utility-owned nuclear power generation stations, which we currently expect to be closed, remain open and we
anticipate that its financial measures weaken, including adjusted FFO to debt consistently below 14%.

Upside scenario
Although unlikely given our expectation for weakened financial measures due to the impact of U.S. tax reform, we
could raise our rating on Entergy over the next 24 months if we project that it will improve its adjusted FFO to
debt above 17% on a consistent basis.

System Energy Resources Inc.

Business Risk: Strong
SERI's business risk profile reflects our assessment of its ownership in the Grand Gulf nuclear plant, introducing
significant resource concentration and operating risk. The company's good operating record and strong off-take
agreements with affiliates somewhat mitigate these risks. SERI contributes about 5% of Entergy's consolidated
revenues. SERI sells its portion of the Grand Gulf output (capacity and energy) to Entergy utilities operating in
Louisiana and Mississippi under a unit power sales agreement. SERI receives monthly payments reflecting actual
capacity and energy costs as per agreements with the off-takers, regardless of the quantity of energy delivered, as long
as the unit remains in commercial operation.
Termination of the agreement requires approval from the FERC and will most likely occur when Grand Gulf retires.
We believe SERI's business risk is on the lower end of its business risk profile category due to significant resource
concentration and high operating risk.

We assess the comparable rating analysis modifier as negative, reflecting our view that the business risk profile is near
the lower end of the category. This incorporates the significant level of resource concentration in a single nuclear
plant, which is unusual among peers, and which we view as introducing significantly higher risk.

Financial Risk: Minimal
Our assessment of SERI's stand-alone financial risk profile incorporates a base-case scenario that includes adjusted
FFO to debt in the 50%-55% range, the lower end of the benchmark range of the minimal category. We expect the
supplemental ratio of adjusted cash flow from operations to debt, which captures other cash sources from regulatory
assets, working capital, and other cost deferrals that are unique to utilities, to average about 39% over the next few
years. In addition, we expect capital spending, which when combined with SERI's dividend payments will result in
discretionary cash flow that is mostly positive, providing additional cash flow that can be used to redeem debt. Over
the next few years we expect debt leverage to be relatively modest, as indicated by debt to EBITDA averaging slightly
below 2x. We base our risk assessment on the more relaxed benchmarks of our medial table, reflecting in part the
company's steady cash flow.

Liquidity: Adequate
We assess the company's stand-alone liquidity as adequate because we believe its liquidity sources are likely to cover
uses by more than 1.1x over the next 12 months and meet cash outflows even with a 10% decline in EBITDA. The
assessment also reflects the company's generally prudent risk management, sound relationship with banks, and a
generally satisfactory standing in credit markets.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Estimated cash FFO of about $240 million;

• Debt maturities of about $10 million;

• Working capital inflows of $50 million; and

• Capital spending of about $170 million; and

• Cash and liquid investments of about $160 million.

• Dividends of about $120 million.

System Energy Resources Inc.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

We consider environmental factors in our rating analysis. SERI's social and governance factors are generally
comparable with those of its peers.
We believe SERI will continue to manage its nuclear fuel cycle such that more than 90% of the low-level waste
generated is Class A, which is the least radioactive. Our analysis monitors SERI's operating performance of Grand
Gulf as this will continue to be a key driver of SERI's environment, social, and governance risk.
Entergy continues to decarbonize its portfolio with wind generation investments and plans to have 1,000 MWs of
renewable resources by 2020, including through power purchase agreements in Arkansas and Louisiana. By
pursuing greater renewable generation, the company is meeting its customers' demand for renewable energy.
Social and governance factors are in line with those of other utility companies.

Group Influence
We consider SERI a core subsidiary of Entergy, reflecting our view that it is highly unlikely to be sold, is integral to the
overall group strategy, possesses a strong long-term commitment from senior management, and is closely linked to the
parent's name and reputation. We assess our issuer credit rating on SERI to be in line with Entergy's group credit
profile of 'bbb+'.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
SERI's capital structure consists of about $570 million of senior unsecured and first mortgage bonds.

Analytical conclusions
SERI's senior unsecured debt rating is 'BBB+', the same as its issuer credit rating, because it is unsecured debt of a
qualifying investment-grade regulated utility.

Issue Ratings - Recovery Analysis
SERI's first mortgage bonds benefit from a first-priority lien on substantially all of the utility's real property owned or
subsequently acquired. Collateral coverage of more than 1.5x supports a recovery rating of '1+' and an issue rating two
notches above the issuer credit rating.

To the extent that regulatory authorities allow a rating agency to acknowledge in one jurisdiction a rating issued in another jurisdiction for certain regulatory purposes, S&P
reserves the right to assign, withdraw or suspend such acknowledgment at any time and in its sole discretion. S&P Parties disclaim any duty whatsoever arising out of the
assignment, withdrawal or suspension of an acknowledgment as well as any liability for any damage alleged to have been suffered on account thereof.
S&P keeps certain activities of its business units separate from each other in order to preserve the independence and objectivity of their respective activities. As a result,
certain business units of S&P may have information that is not available to other S&P business units. S&P has established policies and procedures to maintain the
confidentiality of certain non-public information received in connection with each analytical process.
S&P may receive compensation for its ratings and certain analyses, normally from issuers or underwriters of securities or from obligors. S&P reserves the right to disseminate
its opinions and analyses. S&P's public ratings and analyses are made available on its Web sites, www.standardandpoors.com (free of charge), and www.ratingsdirect.com
(subscription), and may be distributed through other means, including via S&P publications and third-party redistributors. Additional information about our ratings fees is
