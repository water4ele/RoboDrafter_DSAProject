In our base-case scenario, we believe Boeing will be able to resume 737 MAX deliveries this fall, contingent on
regulatory approval.The company appears to be on track to present the updated MCAS flight control software to the
FAA in September. We assume it will not take very long for final certification once the FAA receives the update, as
they have been working with Boeing throughout the process. Therefore, deliveries could resume as soon as October
2019. However, there is still considerable uncertainty to this timeline. Furthermore, regulators of other countries will
also have to certify the updated software before Boeing can deliver aircraft to those locations. We believe most global
regulators, with the notable exception of China, will likely give their approval along with or soon after the FAA does.

We do not expect large cancellations or deferrals of MAX orders. Since the MAX grounding, some airlines have
indicated that they will cancel orders, but there have not been any actual cancellations. Aircraft lessor Air Lease Corp.
has said it will convert 15 MAX orders to orders for the larger 787. We believe the vast majority of airlines will
maintain their orders, although delivery dates could shift, as they need these aircraft to support growth or to replace
older aircraft with much higher operating costs. In addition, there is a large backlog of the competing Airbus A320neo
and Airbus has limited ability to raise production rates much from current levels. Therefore if an airline were to cancel
its MAX orders, that airline would have to wait many years to get an A320neo. However, market share could shift over
time in favor of the A320neo, already the market leader, if doubts about the MAX's safety linger.
The 737 MAX grounding will likely result in weak credit ratios into 2020 before recovering. We expect funds from
operations (FFO) to debt will likely remain below our downgrade trigger of 40% through most of 2020 due to the
impact on profitability and cash flow from the MAX grounding. Credit ratios will start to improve as cash flows
increase once the company resumes deliveries this fall, works down the backlog of aircraft built but not delivered, and
customers resume making pre-delivery payments for aircraft on order. It will likely take until the end of 2020 before
Boeing can deliver all the aircraft built during the grounding, as it can only deliver around an estimated 70 per month
based on the highest historical delivery rate. This should result in FFO to debt increasing to above 40% by the end of
2020, even if deliveries do not resume until early 2020.

Compensation to airlines will mostly be in forms other than cash payments. In the second quarter of 2019, Boeing took
a $5.6 billion pre-tax charge to cover compensation to airlines for the grounding of the MAX and delayed deliveries.
We expect only a modest portion of that amount will be cash compensation, which the company will likely pay out in
the next six to nine months. The remainder will likely be in the form of discounts on future orders, free upgrades or
services, or the rescheduling of deliveries that will occur over the next few years. Boeing will also likely have costs to
compensate the families of the victims of the crash, but we believe insurance will likely cover most of those costs.
However, the lower MAX production rates will affect program profitability. Boeing has added $2.7 billion to the total
737 program costs due to the prolonged period of only producing 42 aircraft a month when it was expecting to
produce 57 a month. This will modestly reduce overall program profitability, but the 737 will likely remain the
company's most profitable commercial aircraft program. The temporarily lower production rates will allow suppliers,
many of which had been struggling to produce at 52 a month, to catch up. We assume 737 production will get back to
that number by the end of 2020 if deliveries resume later this year.
Boeing has taken significant steps to bolster liquidity while the MAX remains grounded. Since the MAX was grounded,
the company has suspended share repurchases, put a short-term $1.5 billion revolver in place and taken other actions
to conserve cash. It has also issued $10.5 billion in debt, although $4.2 billion of that is to cover the pending
investment in the Embraer joint venture. We believe these actions, combined with the significant cash flow the rest of
the business produces and temporary suspension of share buybacks, should enable the company to handle the $8
billion to $10 billion of peak outflows before MAX deliveries resume. As of June 30, 2019, the company had $9.6 billion
of cash and marketable securities and access to a total of $6.6 billion of revolving credit facilities. We expect Boeing to
resume share repurchases when all the aircraft built during the grounding are delivered and production has increased
to 57 a month.
The remainder of Boeing's business remains strong. The company has increased production of the 787 to 14 a month
and the defense and aftermarket operations are generating solid growth and margins, providing earnings and cash
flows that will somewhat offset the impact of the MAX grounding.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on Boeing Co. reflects our expectation that credit measures will likely be below our downgrade
trigger through most of 2020 due to the MAX grounding, but then recover to levels appropriate for the rating. We
expect funds from operations (FFO) to debt to decline to 15%-20% in 2019 from 72% in 2018, and then improve to
the 55%-65% range 2020.

Downside scenario
We could lower the rating if FFO to debt falls below 40% and remains there in 2020. This could occur if the MAX
grounding is substantially longer than we anticipate or causes material order cancellations such that Boeing does
not increase production as planned once deliveries resume. It could also occur if significant supply chain problems
upset planned production increases, if order cancellations increase significantly because of a weaker global
economy or geopolitical crises, if defense sales decrease substantially, or if shareholder returns consistently exceed
cash flow and excess cash on the balance sheet. Credit ratios could also deteriorate because of additional large
acquisitions, while the company continues to return all its free cash flow to shareholders once the MAX issue is
resolved.

Upside scenario
Although unlikely, we could raise the rating in the next two years if the company successfully resumes MAX
deliveries, raises production to 57 a month, reduces debt it used to support liquidity during the grounding,
profitably delivers on its huge backlog, and successfully develops new derivatives of existing models while
maintaining its conservative financial policy and exceptional liquidity, with FFO-to-debt consistently above 60%.
We could also raise the rating if the company improves EBITDA margins to around 15% and maintains FFO to
debt of at least 50%.

Assumptions

• Demand for Boeing's commercial aircraft is tied to
growth in global air travel, which is somewhat
correlated with global GDP (over the long term), and
growth in per capita wealth and other factors.
Related aftermarket services depend on both air
traffic growth and the size and age of the global
fleet. The firm's defense operations depend on U.S.
and allied governments' military spending and are
largely independent of economic factors.

• MAX deliveries resume in October 2019 and Boeing
is able to deliver 70 aircraft a month by the end of
2019, with all aircraft built during the grounding
delivered by the end of 2020. Production increases
to 57 a month by the end of 2020 from 42 a month.
• The majority of the airline compensation occurs in
the next two years. Furthermore, margins on future
737 deliveries are modestly lower due to the
prolonged production decrease and other costs
directly related to the grounding.
• Revenues decline more than 15% in 2019 due to the
MAX grounding, offset by solid growth at BDS and
BGS. Revenues then increase more than 50% in
2020 as aircraft built during the grounding are
delivered and MAX production increases to 57 a
month.
• EBITDA margins decline to 7%-9% in 2019 due to
the impact of the MAX grounding, especially the
$5.6 billion charge, then return to 15%-16% in 2020.
• Significant inventory build in 2019 due to the MAX
grounding, which largely reverses in 2020. Capital
expenditures steady at around $2.3 billion.
• Dividends increase 10% per year.
• No further share repurchases in 2019 ($2.3 billion
were made before the MAX grounding in March plus
$400 million as part of a preset 10b5-1 program in
the second quarter), but increases significantly in
late 2020 once MAX deliveries equal production.

Company Description
Boeing designs, manufactures, and markets a full range of large commercial jetliners through its Boeing Commercial
Airplanes unit (BCA). Its defense operations, Boeing Defense, Space & Security (BDS), produces fighter jets, military
cargo aircraft, attack and cargo helicopters, civil and military satellites, and missile defense systems. In mid-2017, the
company combined the service offerings of its commercial and defense businesses into a new segment, Boeing Global
Services (BGS). This new segment provides a range of services including flight training, maintenance, spare parts
distribution, data analysis, navigation products, and logistics. The company also provides financing, primarily for its
commercial aircraft, through its Boeing Capital (BCC) subsidiary.

Business Risk: Strong
Boeing is one of two global producers of large commercial aircraft and is the second-largest U.S. defense contractor.
However, these markets are very competitive (especially commercial aircraft manufacturing), which limits profit
margins. Although the company is taking significant actions to improve profitability, the development of new aircraft
types is very expensive and risky. We expect U.S. defense spending to increase through at least government fiscal year
2020. Although the pace of growth thereafter is still somewhat uncertain, higher U.S. military spending and demand
from international customers should support modest growth of Boeing's defense operations.
Boeing essentially splits the global market for large commercial jetliners with the European Airbus Group, but Boeing
has a somewhat stronger position in the wide-body segment of the market, while Airbus has a somewhat stronger
position in narrow-body aircraft (see charts 4 and 5).

Boeing estimates the global market for commercial jetliners (of more than 100 seats) at more than 44,000 planes worth
$6.8 trillion over the next 20 years (Airbus' forecast is similar), doubling the size of the global fleet. Global air traffic
growth has slowed somewhat in 2019, but from levels well above historical averages of around 5%.

Long-term shifts in market share possible
Boeing's small- to medium-sized 787 wide-body aircraft, which incorporate new technology to save fuel and other
benefits, have been successful. Airbus introduced the A330neo but has only received fewer than 250 orders. Boeing is
in the process of developing a successor version of its larger wide-body 777 (the 777X) incorporating similar
technology early in the next decade. However, the backlog for the 777X has only grown modestly since the program
launched and some of the initial customers are troubled Middle Eastern airlines. The first flight of the 777X has been
delayed to early 2020 from 2019 because of issues with developing the new engines from General Electric, but it still
expects the first deliveries next year. Boeing has slowed development of the smaller, longer range version, the 777-8.
The MAX accidents and grounding could result in a longer and more expensive certification process for the new
models, as the FAA has received a lot of criticism for how it handled the certification of the MCAS software for the
MAX. Airbus has delivered almost 300 of the its own new-technology, wide-body A350, which will include versions
that compete with the 777.
Airbus has a several-year lead in introducing its new A320neo narrow-body aircraft ahead of Boeing's similar
737-MAX, and currently has a larger backlog. The small- and medium-sized versions of these planes sell at comparable
rates, but the popularity of the largest Airbus version, the A321neo, prompted Boeing to develop the 737-10 MAX to
be more directly comparable to the A321neo. Airbus also began offering a longer range version, the A321XLR, which
has proven very popular and for which Boeing does not have a direct competitor. As Airbus is not able to increase
production much more than it currently plans, it is unlikely it will benefit much from the MAX grounding in the near
term.
Boeing is currently considering developing a new aircraft, often referred to as the New Midsize Airplane (NMA). It
would be between the 737 and 787 in both size and range, (225-275 seats and 4,500-5,000 miles range) and replace the

SEPTEMBER 4, 2019 11

Boeing Co.

757 and 767. The A321XLR will likely be a strong competitor in the targeted market and will be available sooner. The
company had originally planned to launch the NMA in 2019 with first deliveries in 2025, but appears to be struggling
to design an aircraft with acceptable margins for Boeing that has the performance airlines are demanding at a price
they are willing to pay. The MAX grounding has also likely redirected some resources that were working on the NMA
and it's unlikely they will launch the aircraft until the MAX is flying again. Other issues include uncertainty about the
ultimate size of the market, whether it will be a single-aisle or twin-aisle aircraft, what new technologies to include, the
need for engine-makers to develop a new engine for this class of aircraft, and any changes to certification requirements
after the MAX accidents. Boeing should be able to develop the aircraft without increasing its research and
development (R&D) spending materially, as its current largest development program, the 777X, will be in production
by the time NMA R&D ramps up in a few years.

Orders will likely remain weak in 2019
The moderation in orders is due to several factors. The company has largely satisfied the pent-up demand from the
2008-2009 recession and its aftermath, and there are relatively few new programs at a stage where airlines start
placing orders. If an airline places an order today it would likely not receive an aircraft for five or six years because of
the large backlog for popular models (737 MAX and 787, for example). Weaker economic growth in some regions and
the impact of the trade war with China are also likely affecting demand. A moderate level of new orders will be driven
by solid air traffic growth, still-healthy airline profits, and the still-substantial needs to replace aging aircraft currently in
service (demand for new planes comprises about 55%-60% for growth and 40%-45% for replacement). China has thus
far excluded large commercial jet imports from the U.S. from tariffs it intends to levy, probably reflecting the inability
of Airbus to replace them near-term and perhaps hopes that a different U.S. Administration would change trade policy
in the future. But a protracted U.S.-China confrontation could handicap Boeing in future campaigns to sell planes to
China. Although a much smaller market than commercial aircraft, Boeing has also recently seen higher demand for
cargo aircraft, but this will likely decline as air freight demand has been weak because of lower economic growth and
trade frictions.

Chart 7

The MAX grounding and supply chain issues have constrained deliveries
Despite the current weakness, booming orders earlier in the decade have caused a buildup of a substantial backlog of
more than 5,500 aircraft worth $390 billion. The company has determined that this backlog, which represents more
than six years of production, is too high and has increased production on the most popular aircraft types. However, it
cut production rates on the large wide-body 747 due to weak demand from air cargo operators and virtually no recent
orders from passenger airlines. In addition, the company also cut production on the 777, as it could not win enough
orders to hold production rates until the 777X starts delivering in 2020. Prior to the MAX grounding, Boeing expected
to deliver 895-905 aircraft in 2019, up from 806 in 2017, due to the expected 737 deliveries of 57 a month and 787
rates of 14 per month. We now believe Boeing will only deliver 500-550 aircraft, depending on when MAX deliveries
resume and how quickly Boeing can get them to customers. This year will be the first since 2011 that Airbus will
deliver more aircraft than Boeing. The supply chain has been straining to keep up, with suppliers of the fuselage for the
737, engines for the 737 MAX, and interiors for wide-body aircraft all having issues in the past year. This could limit
further increases, especially for the 737, which is seeing the greatest market demand for more deliveries.

Profitability is a key focus
Boeing is taking a number of steps to raise its profitability, reduce development time of new aircraft, improve efficiency
(such as using more automation), and increase its control of the production process. Profit margins have been well
below those of its suppliers and these actions are intended to capture more of the value throughout the aircraft's
lifecycle.
The first step was its "partnering for success" program, which aims to reduce supplier costs by offering them additional
work and help improve their own operating efficiency in exchange for lower prices. The challenge is to lower costs but

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 4, 2019 13

Boeing Co.

not impair suppliers' ability to keep up with increasing production. The recent U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum, as
well as on certain parts from China, could offset some of the planned profitability gains.
Boeing's next area of focus is to greatly expand its presence in the aftermarket. Last year, the company formed BGS,
which it plans to grow to $50 billion in sales in five to 10 years through organic growth and acquisitions (such as the
purchase of distributor KLX for $4.25 billion). Boeing has also decided to bring some work (previously done by
suppliers) back in-house (such as the 777X wing) and is developing capabilities in avionics, seats, actuators, nacelles,
and auxiliary power units to offer an alternative to existing suppliers. These actions will likely weaken the sales and
earnings of Boeing's suppliers and have prompted a wave of consolidation, most notably United Technologies'
acquisition of Rockwell Collins. However, the full impact on the supply chain will not likely be known until after the
next new aircraft, such as the NMA, is launched.
Boeing also announced it has agreed to a JV with Embraer's commercial aircraft operations (Boeing would invest $4.2
billion to own 80%). The JV would not only extend Boeing's product line into the regional jet market, but would give
the company access to Embraer's lower-cost engineers and more efficient aircraft development process. We expect
the transaction to close by the end of this year. The deal with Embraer was at least partially in response to Airbus'
acquisition of the C-series program from Bombardier (since renamed the Airbus A220).

The defense business is growing
Boeing's defense business will likely grow moderately as U.S. defense spending and foreign sales increase. The recent
deal for fiscal 2020 and 2021 U.S. military budgets provides more visibility to near-term spending, although
longer-term growth rates are still uncertain. Growth programs include the troubled KC-46A aerial refueling tanker
(based on the 767 freighter and which began deliveries earlier this year) and P-8 maritime patrol aircraft. Although
Boeing lost out to Northrop Grumman on the next-generation B-21 bomber program, it won the T-X trainer for the
U.S. Air Force, and the MQ-25A unmanned aerial tanker for the Navy last year. However, it bid very aggressively to
win both programs, requiring almost $700 million of charges, and raising questions about the long-term profitability of
the programs. Boeing has said it will not bid on the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent nuclear ballistic missile unless
the Air Force changes the contract structure, leaving Northrop Grumman as the only bidder. Boeing's current fighter
programs have also been revived with recent orders from the U.S. Navy for the F/A-18 and foreign orders for the F-15,
as well as funds in the fiscal 2020 budget proposal for the F-15X (a new version of the F-15) for the U.S. Air Force.

Peer comparison
Boeing was the world's largest aerospace and defense company in 2018, about 35% larger than Airbus and almost
twice the size of Lockheed Martin. Boeing's and Airbus' commercial aircraft businesses are similar in size and breadth
of product offerings, but Boeing has a bigger share of widebodies and Airbus of narrowbodies. Boeing's commercial
operations are more profitable than Airbus'. In the defense market, Boeing is the second-largest company, about 80%
the size of Lockheed, but with a less favorable product portfolio. It is only modestly larger than General Dynamics'
defense operations and Raytheon. Overall, Boeing's EBITDA margins are modestly weaker than those of General
Dynamics and Lockheed, but much lower than Raytheon's and much better than Airbus'.

Financial Risk: Modest
We expect credit ratios to deteriorate materially in 2019 due to the MAX grounding, before rebounding in 2020. This
will likely result in FFO to debt declining below 20% in 2019 from 70% in 2018. In our base case, FFO to debt returns

to the 55%-65% range in 2020, but this depends on when MAX deliveries resume and how quickly Boeing can deliver
aircraft built during the grounding. It also depends on when and how aggressively Boeing resumes share repurchases
following the MAX's return to service. We expect in 2021 Boeing will resume its historically high level of share
repurchases and continue to make acquisitions to build out is aftermarket business, resulting in FFO to debt in the
50%-60% range.
Boeing's cash from operations has increased significantly in recent years (see chart 8), reaching more than $15 billion
in 2018 from around $8 billion in 2013. This increase was due to greater cash flow on the 787 as production increased
and development problems were resolved, as well as increasing 737 production. We expect cash flow from operations
to be about breakeven in 2019 due to the MAX grounding, before increasing to well above $20 billion in 2020 as
aircraft built during the grounding are delivered. It will likely than return to a more normalized level of around $18
billion in 2021.
The company invested a total of about $13 billion in capital expenditures in 2013 to 2018 , but it returned the majority
of cash flow, and usually more, to shareholders, totaling $54 billion of share repurchases and dividends. We expect the
company to resume a high level of share repurchases once the MAX issue is resolved. Acquisition activity had been
modest before 2017, but then the company spent more than $3 billion on KLX. We expect the $4.2 billion Embraer
transaction to close in late 2019 and the company to make additional acquisitions to augment growth in BGS.
Chart 8

We analyze BCC as a captive finance company, but its assets and liabilities are modest relative to the consolidated
totals and do not affect our financial risk assessment. BCC's mission is to help arrange for customer financing, but to
avoid--where possible--providing that financing itself.

Liquidity: Exceptional
We consider Boeing's liquidity to be exceptional. We expect sources of liquidity to exceed uses by at least 2.1x over
the next 12-24 months and that sources would exceed uses even if EBITDA declined by 50%. We also expect the
company to maintain substantial cushion under the leverage covenant in its credit facilities. Boeing has taken
significant actions to preserve liquidity during the MAX crisis, including suspending share repurchases, reducing cash
use in other parts of the business, and putting in place a temporary $1.5 billion revolver. It also issued $10.5 billion of
debt to bolster cash and prefund the Embraer transaction and upcoming maturities.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

Boeing faces long term environmental risk related to regulations of aircraft greenhouse gas (GHG) and nitrogen
oxide emissions; however, this is not material to the rating at this time. Current regulations can be met with
existing technology, but if the regulations are tightened it may require investment to develop new technologies
(most likely this would fall mainly on the engine manufacturers) and could increase costs for airlines, possibly
slowing air travel and aircraft demand. It could also be a positive, as airlines are forced to order newer generation
aircraft to replace non-compliant models. Boeing has been investing a modest amount in developing new
technologies, such as biofuels, to address this risk. We don't believe Boeing's defense operations (about 30% of
sales) carry material environmental risk.
Product safety is a key risk for an aircraft manufacturer. The three-month grounding of the 787 in 2013 did not
have a material impact on the company's financials or the plane's backlog. While the near-term impact of the 737
MAX grounding has certainly been material, we don't expect a permanent financial impact, as insurance may have
covered some of the costs, but the long-term effects are still unknown. Another social risk involves Boeing's mostly
unionized work force, since strikes can cause a significant, even if short-term, disruption and financial cost. The
company has had a somewhat contentious relationship with its unions, but has come to terms with its main unions
in the most recent negotiations.
We view Boeing's governance as satisfactory, reflecting its extensive planning process and ability to adapt to
operational issues, such as the development problems with the 787. However, it continues to face cost overruns
and delays on certain military programs like the KC-46 aerial refueling tanker, and the 737 MAX issue is putting a
spotlight on the company's design process and communications with customers and investors. It generally
balances the needs of its stakeholders, but has favored shareholders somewhat in recent years.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
Pro forma for the July 2019 debt issuance, the company's capital structure comprised approximately $22 billion of
unsecured debt issued by Boeing Co. and $2.5 billion of debt issued by its subsidiary BCC. We consider BCC to be a
captive finance company so we do not include its debt in our analysis.

Analytical conclusions
We rate the company's unsecured debt 'A', the same level as our issuer credit rating, because there is no evidence of
significant subordination risk in its capital structure.
