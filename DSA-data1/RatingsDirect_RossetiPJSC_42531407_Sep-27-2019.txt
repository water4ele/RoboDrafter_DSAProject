Key Risks

Monopolistic position in Russia's electricity transmission and
distribution market.

High country risk in Russia, leading to a lack of regulatory protection
from political intervention.

Relatively stable nature of the regulated utility business, with
long-term tariffs covering operating expenditure (opex) and most
capital expenditure (capex).

Uncertainties surrounding returns on investments in digitalization and
new projects, and the start of the new regulatory period for the largest
subsidiary in mid-2020.

Solid credit metrics, with expected funds from operations (FFO) to
debt of 30%-40% in 2019-2020.

Large investment needs and potentially increasing dividends.

High likelihood of extraordinary government support.

Rosseti's holding structure, with only indirect access to cash flows
generated by operating subsidiaries.

Rosseti PJSC benefits from a stable regulated utility business as Russia's largest electricity transmission and distribution
operator. Rosseti is a state-owned holding company. It controls 90% of Russia's transmission grids and 75% of
distribution grids via multiple subsidiaries operating across the country's large territory. Subsidiaries' tariff parameters
are set for five years, with annual tariff adjustments, and are designed to cover opex and most capex, resulting in
generally predictable cash flows and a track record of profitable operations.
Rosseti's regulatory framework is subject to frequent changes and is not sufficiently insulated from political intervention.
The government often attempts to manually control electricity transmission and distribution tariffs and Rosseti's capex
to achieve broader policy goals, which S&P Global Ratings believes could lead to tariff deficits or stranded assets. After
the tariff freeze in 2014, Rosseti's tariffs increased above inflation in 2016-2019 on the back of Russia's economic
stabilization. It is unclear if this favorable trend will continue, given Russia's low GDP growth and the pending start of
the new regulatory period for Rosseti's largest subsidiary, Federal Grid Co. (FGC), in mid-2020. Although Rosseti has
some flexibility to offset regulatory uncertainties via modifications to the capex program, the tariff structure does not
cover potential increases in dividends, which we believe could rise under the Russian government's policy to increase
payouts, or from management's attempts to increase the group's market capitalization. We will monitor how regulatory
developments will affect the company's ability to generate and keep returns on its massive investments in digitalization

and new infrastructure. Capacity payments, longer-term tariffs, and higher connection fees for small customers are all
currently under discussion. These elements are key for Rosseti's profitability and deficit reduction.
Rosseti's digital transformation program should not materially increase capex. We expect solid credit metrics, with
FFO to debt of 30%-40% and debt to EBITDA of about 2.0x, but negative discretionary cash flow (DCF). We
understand that although the total cost of Rosseti's digitalization program is preliminary, estimated at a massive
Russian ruble (RUB) 1.3 trillion ($19.7 billion) over 12-15 years (subject to potential revisions), the total capex budget is
unlikely to materially increase. This is because Rosseti will replace traditional projects with new and economically
efficient digital solutions. Still, Rosseti has fundamentally large capex needs due to its massive asset size,
modernization and expansion requirements, and ongoing large working capital outlays. Capex can be subject to
execution risks and depend on the progress of Russia's large national infrastructure projects, which are generally
outside of Rosseti's control (e.g. new railways or pipelines).
The company has only indirect access to cash flows from operating subsidiaries. In our view, Rosseti's shareholding
agreement with the Russian government regarding FGC, which accounts for about half of consolidated EBITDA, and
the presence of sizeable minority shareholders at most operating subsidiaries limits its access to the subsidiaries' cash
flows except for dividends. In our base case, we assume no divestment of FGC and no major changes in the group's
role and structure except for potential minor bolt-on acquisitions, possibly funded with the proceeds from the recent
sale of minority stake in InterRAO, a noncore asset.

Outlook: Stable

Our stable outlook on Rosseti reflects that on Russia, and our expectation of a high likelihood of extraordinary
government support. We expect a gradual improvement in the company's stand-alone performance, with FFO to
debt of 30%-40% in 2019-2020, debt to EBITDA of about 2x, and a manageable debt maturity profile. However, we
note that DCF remains negative due to high capex, working capital outlays, and potentially increasing dividends. In
our base-case scenario, we include no material changes to the group's consolidated structure, and have not
changed our assessment of the likelihood of extraordinary government support.

Downside scenario
Rating downside could stem from a sovereign downgrade. We don't expect to rate Rosseti above the sovereign
because its stand-alone credit profile (SACP) is weaker than the sovereign foreign currency rating, and its business
is domestically focused. Furthermore, its link with the government is very strong, implying risks of negative
government intervention in a sovereign stress scenario.
We could also lower the rating if Rosseti's SACP was to deteriorate to 'bb-' or lower, owing to liquidity becoming
less than adequate or weaker financial performance, with FFO to debt lower than 20%. The latter could happen if
capex, dividends, or working capital outlays are significantly larger than our current expectations. In addition, a
downgrade could stem from a material weakening of ongoing or extraordinary government support or loss of
control over key assets, such as FGC. However, we consider these scenarios very unlikely and the rating has
significant headroom for higher capex, dividends, or acquisitions.

Upside scenario
We may upgrade Rosseti if we upgrade Russia and at the same time revise the SACP to 'bb+'. The revision of the
SACP could be due to a combination of:
• Solid consolidated financials, with no large negative DCF and FFO to debt significantly above 30%.
• Continuing improvements in the stand-alone credit quality of Rosseti's key subsidiaries (notably FGC).
• Regulatory developments, including more clarity about the next regulatory period for FGC and how Rosseti's
large capex in digitalization and new projects will be covered via tariffs.
In the absence of a sovereign upgrade, an improvement in Rosseti's SACP alone will not be sufficient to raise the
rating.

Assumptions

• Regulated transmission and distribution revenue to
increase by 4%-6% in 2019 and 2020, and at close to
the 4% consumer price index (CPI) thereafter.
• No significant changes in new regulatory periods
(mid-2020 for FGC), and no effect from potential
regulatory changes currently under discussion, such
as capacity payments and 10-year tariffs.
• Relatively volatile connection fees of RUB30
billion-RUB40 billion annually, depending on the
commissioning of new generation capacity. We view
connection fees as a contribution to capex and
exclude them from revenue and EBITDA.

• Costs increase below inflation thanks to ongoing
efficiency improvements and lower electricity losses.
• Capex of RUB210 billion-RUB240 billion in
2019-2021, net of value-added tax and capitalized
interest, which is in line with management's
expectations. The slight increase in 2019 capex
compared with 2018 reflects the lag between actual
works and cash payments, while we believe
digitalization should not materially increase total
capex.
• Significant working capital outlays.
• Dividends to gradually increase but remain
significantly below 50% of consolidated net income.
• No material changes to the group's structure or any
large new investments, unless these cash outflows
are offset with government funding, tariff increases,
or the expected receipt of RUB34 billion for the sale
of a minority stake in InterRAO, FGC's noncore
asset.

Base-case projections
In 2019-2020, we expect EBITDA and FFO to increase thanks to ongoing cost cutting and continuing tariff increases.
We expect cost cutting to come from lower electricity losses and the optimization of purchases and maintenance. We
assume only a moderate reduction in receivable write-offs, given that record collection rates of close to 100% in
2017-2018 reflected the settlement of old receivables. The new regulatory developments currently under discussion
imply EBITDA upside, but we do not include them in our base case before they are approved.

Rosseti PJSC

We expect Rosseti to gradually progress with digitalization capex in line with its strategy. The company is starting with
several pilots and focusing on the most economically efficient projects first. We continue to see significant uncertainty
surrounding the technical scope, size, timing, execution, and financing of digitalization. We understand that
digitalization is subject to the government's local content requirements, which are quite understandable given the
sanctions against Russia. Although Russian suppliers are developing their expertise in digitalization, we cannot rule out
delays or organizational bottlenecks. The main positive is that Rosseti has some flexibility in the schedule of capex
related to digitalization and other areas.
We expect negative DCF due to continuing working capital outlays and solid capex. Despite this, in first-half 2019
actual capex (RUB81 billion) was significantly lower than budgeted, which is often seen at Russian government-related
entities (GREs). We note that most of Rosseti's distribution subsidiaries have recently switched voluntarily from a
regulated asset-base (RAB) to a less complex revenue indexation, which limits maximum capex at 12% of allowed
revenue. We also understand that despite a large working capital outlay in first-half 2019, the group has some
flexibility in working capital management in the future.
We believe that Rosseti may, like other Russian GREs, need to increase dividends from currently low levels to support its
market capitalization. Rosseti can adopt a new dividend policy by year-end 2019. Still, we believe that payouts will be
well below 50% of consolidated net income. In line with Rosseti's current dividend policy, a parent-level payout should
be adjusted to reflect dividends actually received from subsidiaries, noncash items, and parental support to weaker
subsidiaries.

Company Description
Rosseti is an 88% government-owned holding company that controls Russia's monopoly electricity transmission
operator FGC, 15 distribution grid companies, and several regional grid and electricity supply companies, with an
overall geographic footprint covering almost all of Russia. Under Russian corporate law, the government's stake in
FGC (direct plus indirect) can't fall below the control threshold of under 50% plus one share. So long as Rosseti keeps
an 80% stake in FGC, the government's stake in Rosseti cannot be below 62.5%. Rosseti group is present across 80
Russian regions, employs about 217,000 people, and controls 2.35 million kilometers of transmission and distribution
grids, and 507,000 substations, with a transformer capacity of about 792 gigawatts.

Business Risk: Fair
Rosseti's leading position in the Russian electricity industry supports the company's business risk profile. Its regulated
business is generally stable, thanks to five-year tariffs on transmission and distribution activities, designed to cover
both opex and capex and support solid EBITDA margins (25%-30%), historically and in our base case. Rosseti's
subsidiaries use either RAB-based regulation (FGC and some distribution grids) or revenue indexation (most
distribution grids).
That said, we believe that regulatory framework in Russia is frequently changing, and the implementation of Russia's
quite detailed tariff-setting rules could be subject to uncertainties and inconsistencies across various regions. For
example, Rosseti's subsidiaries sometimes find it difficult to include newly built assets in the RAB, and the government
aims to increase dividends without adjusting tariffs. In addition, the government typically tries to limit tariff increases
for all regulated natural monopolies. If actual costs and capex increases exceed that level, allowed revenue is brought

forward via tariff smoothing. Compensation of the resulting tariff deficit is often uncertain, because the regulators try to
avoid too-high tariff increases for social reasons.
We understand that by the middle of 2019, the total accumulated tariff deficit was about RUB46.5 billion (all in
distribution), down from RUB65.6 billion at year-end 2018, or about 20% of 2018 consolidated adjusted EBITDA. This
is material, but manageable for Rosseti. After the tariff freeze in 2014, Rosseti has enjoyed comfortable tariff increases
in recent years (charts 1 and 2), because the country's improving economic situation made above-inflation tariff
adjustments economically and politically affordable. It is uncertain whether this trend will continue in 2020-2022, given
the relatively low economic growth in Russia, declining yield on government bonds (used to calculate allowed return
on RAB), and the pending start of the new regulatory period for FGC in July 2020.

Rosseti's operating performance has improved in recent years, with lower losses and outages and higher collection
rates, thanks to increase penalties and an improving payment culture. However, its operating assets still require
massive investment in maintenance and ongoing modernization.
In addition, Rosseti's capex program is largely spurred by the Russian government's focus on economic development
through national projects and digitalization. In December 2018, Rosseti adopted its digitalization program. The
company also invests in projects linked to economic development in Russia's remote regions, such as the
electrification of the Baikal-Amur-Trans-Siberian railway, or electricity supply for new oil and gas pipelines (East
Siberia-–Pacific Ocean and Power of Siberia). We also cannot rule out new projects, such as the electrification of new
railway lines. Because these projects are large, long-term and partly outside of Rosseti's control, there may be
execution risks or the possibility of temporarily stranded assets. Furthermore, the cost of capital in Russia is higher
than in Europe, which raises the opportunity cost of stranded assets.
The Russian government is considering a number of regulatory initiatives to support returns on digitalization capex
and new projects. These include payments for grid capacity, the use of normalized costs, increasing connection fees
for small customers, and longer-term 10-year tariffs that would enable Rosseti to retain economic savings from
digitalization capex for the next regulatory period. These initiatives would be positive for Rosseti's EBITDA and
financial metrics, but we don't include them in our base case before they are approved.

Peer comparison
Compared with European peers such as Tennet or Fingrid, Rosseti faces higher country risk and less predictable
regulation implementation. Therefore, we apply more demanding requirements when assessing Rosseti's financial risk

profile. Our assessment of Rosseti's SACP is one notch below that of FGC, its most profitable transmission subsidiary,
and currently in line with its smaller and relatively weaker distribution subsidiaries MOESK and Interregional
Distribution Grid of the Center (IDGC). This reflects Rosseti group's complex structure, with consolidated metrics that
are somewhat weaker than FGC's but somewhat stronger than MOESK's and IDGC's. Because of our expectation of
government support, we rate Rosseti and FGC at the level of the sovereign, while MOESK and IDGC have one notch
of uplift above their SACPs based on the likelihood of parental support.

Financial Risk: Significant
We expect that Rosseti will maintain FFO to debt of 30%-40% in 2019-2020, but DCF will turn negative due to large
capex and ongoing working capital outlays. Still, the rating has significant headroom for a gradual debt increase.
The group's debt is fully denominated in rubles, matching the currency of earnings and cash flows. Most of the total
consolidated debt bears fixed rates. About RUB150 billion of the RUB585 billion total International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) reported debt at June 30, 2019, is related to infrastructure bonds at the level of Rosseti and its
subsidiary FGC, with the long-term maturity and interest mainly linked to CPI. The group's overall maturity profile is
comfortable, in our view.
Of the RUB585 billion total consolidated debt reported on June 30, 2019, only RUB31 billion is at the parent level, and
the rest is with various cash-generating subsidiaries. We currently do not rate debt at the parent level but note that
parent-level creditors are structurally subordinated to those of cash-generated subsidiaries.

Liquidity: Adequate
We view Rosseti's consolidated liquidity as adequate. Although the ratio of liquidity sources to uses is above 2x, we
view this as a temporary situation and don't expect management will maintain such sizeable reserves in the future.
Some of the group's subsidiaries, notably FGC, have large committed lines, while the parent's access to
subsidiary-level cash is only indirect. The company has sound relationships with Russian banks, as well as proven
access to the ruble bond market and to the government's financial support. However, like many other emerging market
issuers, Rosseti could experience fluctuations in financial market access or funding costs, and we view the Russian
banking system as relatively weak.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

We forecast principal liquidity sources as of June 30,
2019, include:

We forecast principal liquidity uses over the same
period include:

• Cash and equivalents of RUB87.4 billion.

• Short-term maturities of RUB117.7 billion.

• Short-term financial investments of RUB56.2 billion.

• Capex of RUB200 billion-RUB230 billion.

• Long-term bank lines of above RUB400 billion,
although mostly at the subsidiary level.

• Total parent-level and minority dividends of about
RUB19 billion.

• FFO of RUB170 billion-RUB190 billion.
• Potential proceeds from the sale of InterRAO shares
(RUB34 billion at the FGC level).

Environmental, Social, And Governance

Social and governance factors are significant in our overall analysis of Rosseti. The group's subsidiaries provide an
important transmission and distribution service with a significant social impact. Consequently, the government
sometimes limits tariff increases and assigns Rosseti the unprofitable, but socially important, role of a guaranteeing
supplier, or has it invest in politically important projects--such as developing Russia's Far East or smart meters.
This makes Rosseti's regulated business less predictable but also creates incentives for government support. In
addition, Rosseti's capex plans, notably for digitalization and other large projects, reflect the government's policy of
increasing Russia's GDP growth above the currently modest 1.7%-1.8% via infrastructure investments. From an
environmental standpoint, Russia is less focused on renewable development than most European countries and,
therefore, there is less of a need for network development to support new, potentially volatile, energy sources. We
don't expect this to change in the immediate future.

Government Influence
We consider Rosseti a GRE under our criteria. In accordance with our criteria for rating GREs, we base our view of a
high likelihood of timely extraordinary government support on our assessment of Rosseti's:
• Important role, given that the group provides an essential infrastructure service for the country's economy. Still, we
believe that the government focuses primarily on operations and investments. We believe that a hypothetical debt
restructuring or default would not necessarily lead to a disruption of the group's activities.
• Very strong link with the Russian government, given the direct state ownership (88%), strong track record of
ongoing financial support to the group's entities (in the form of capital injections and favorable funding in the form
of infrastructure bonds), and the level of control over the group's strategy, operations, and financial performance.

We make a number of analytical adjustments to Rosseti's reported numbers. We will monitor the effect of IFRS on
operating lease reporting, but we expect any effect on adjusted metrics will be manageable. We currently net the
group's sizeable cash balances from adjusted debt, because we believe that cash is available to repay debt, but we note
that the group mostly works with large Russian banks, while the country's banking system is weak. We treat large
connection fees as contributions to capex and therefore exclude them from revenue.
