Overview
Key strengths

Key risks

Good product and market diversity

Very high leverage relative to peers.

Reinvestment in business leading to increased
community count.

Refinancing risk on upcoming maturities.
Cyclical nature of the homebuilding industry and a potential deterioration in
homebuilding industry conditions.

Hovnanian has upcoming maturities on debt obligations that it will have trouble meeting if it cannot refinance.
Hovnanian has about $270 million of maturities between now and November 2021. We believe it will either need to
refinance these obligations or significantly reduce its land spending to generate enough cash to repay them. The
company faced a similar situation in 2016 and was unable to access the capital markets to refinance. Consequently, the
company reduced its land spending, which resulted in a reduction in its land position and community count while
generating cash to repay its obligations. Subsequently, the company saw its business shrink in an environment in
which most homebuilders saw their businesses grow.
Leverage is high relative to other rated homebuilders but we still expect an improvement from current levels.At the end
of its fiscal year (October 2018), debt levels were lower than expected on account of payments made on its revolving
credit facility and some additional debt pay downs. As a result, debt to EBITDA was slightly lower than we expected at
year end. However, leverage above 12x EBITDA as of July 31, 2019 is still high relative to our rated universe of U.S.
homebuilders.
There was some deterioration in industry conditions as higher mortgage rates affected orders at the end of the calendar
year. As mortgage rates rose to 4.9% in November 2018 from about 3.9% at the beginning of 2018, most homebuilders
in our rated universe saw a slowdown in business. Hovnanian's orders declined about 9%, to 934, in the first quarter
ended January 2019 from 1,027 in the same period last year. As mortgage rates have declined since the end of the
year, to the 3.7% area, the company has reported an increase in orders, growing 10.1% and 22.6% year over year in
the second and third quarters, respectively, to 1,546 and 1,515. We expect to see continued improvement in orders,
absent an uptick in rates back to the 5% area.

Outlook

The negative rating outlook reflects the risk to our current base-case scenario that Hovnanian will generate
sufficient EBITDA to meet its interest payments over the next 12-18 months, presenting liquidity constraints in
meeting its $75 million of maturities due in 2020. We anticipate that, over the next 24 months, Hovnanian's annual
EBITDA will remain between $150 million and $180 million, with interest expense between $140 million and $150
million.

Downside scenario
We would lower the rating within the next 12 months if EBITDA declined below a level needed to support its
annual interest expense, currently below $140 million and we began to see the company burn through its cash
position. This would cause liquidity to become strained such that we believe the company would have trouble
meeting its upcoming obligations, including its interest payments and $75 million of debt maturities in 2020. We
could also lower the rating should the company execute another debt exchange or restructuring.

Upside scenario
An upgrade is unlikely over the next 12 months given the company's high leverage. A positive rating action would
require the company to improve EBITDA interest coverage above 1.5x with adequate liquidity, which we believe
would improve the company's prospects for refinancing its 2020 maturities. We estimate that such a scenario could
occur if gross margins expanded by at least 200 basis points (bps), resulting in EBITDA growth over 30% from our
base-case scenario.

Assumptions

Key Metrics

• We expect U.S. GDP to remain at 2.5% in 2019 and
fall to 1.8% in 2020.
• Annual housing starts of 1.3 million in 2019 and
2020.
• Mortgage rate to be about 4.2%, increasing to 4.4%
in 2020.

Base-case projections
We expect consolidated revenue to grow about 2% by the end of this fiscal year. We expect home sale revenue to grow
by about 2.5% by the end of 2019 due to our assumptions of about 2% growth in closings, coupled with relatively flat
average selling prices compared with 2018 levels. After revenues declined about 18% in 2018 due to a lower number of
closings from a smaller number of communities, we expect community count to grow by almost 12% in 2019 as the

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 25, 2019 3

Hovnanian Enterprises Inc.

company continues to increase its spending on land and focuses on opening new communities, which should lead to a
higher number of closings.
Homebuilding gross margins will be relatively flat over the next two years.We expect full year 2019 homebuilding
gross margin to fall by 55 bps, going to 17.9% from 18.4% due to higher input costs. We expect 2020 gross margins to
increase back to 2018 levels of about 18.5% because of favorable double-digit growth in closings expected, partially
offset by higher input costs.
We believe that selling, general and administrative (SG&A) will be higher relative to 2018. We expect SG&A to
increase to about $240 million in 2019 from about $230 million in 2018. Consequently, we estimate SG&A as a percent
of total revenue will increase to about 12% in 2019 from 11.5% in 2018. The 50 bps increase is due to our expectation
of openings of new communities and in line with management guidance. From 2020 onward, we expect improvement
in operating leverage as the company aims to focus on its efficiency.

Company Description
Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. designs, constructs, markets, and sells residential homes in the U.S. It constructs
single-family detached homes, attached townhomes and condominiums, urban infill, and active lifestyle homes. The
company markets its homes for first-time buyers, first-time and second-time move-up buyers, luxury buyers,
active-lifestyle buyers, and empty nesters in 165 communities in 25 markets. It also provides financial services
comprising originating mortgages from homebuyers and selling them in the secondary market, and offers title
insurance services.

Business Risk
Our rating on Hovnanian reflects its relatively weak positions in its markets. This is offset by the company's good
product and market diversity. The company is the 14th-largest homebuilder in the U.S. based on deliveries, with 165
active communities in 25 markets and 14 states. However, the company is not No. 1 or No. 2 in any of its markets. The
company does have what we believe is broad product diversification, with move-up homes being 34% of homes sold in
2018. This is followed by first-time home buyers at 31%, luxury homes at 21%, and active adult at 14%.
Our rating on Hovnanian also reflects the recent lack of investment in the company as Hovnanian had to slow its land
purchases in the business to repay its obligations in 2016. Due to its high level of debt, the company could not access
the capital markets. Consequently, the company underinvested in its business, which resulted in a reduction in its land
position and community count, enabling it to generate cash to repay its obligations. Ultimately making its obligations,
we saw a decline in the business after 2016 across the board from net orders going to 5,586 in 2018 from 6,380 in
2016. Deliveries went to 5,831 from 6,712 and revenues to $1.99 billion from $2.75 billion during that same time
period. As the company is now able to sufficiently invest organically, we expect orders, deliveries, and revenues to
increase about 4.5%, 2.0%, and 2.5%, respectively, in 2019 while continuing to grow in upcoming years.

Financial Risk
Our rating reflects the company's high leverage and upcoming maturities in November 2019 and November 2020. We
expect the company to meet these obligations. The company's $26 million note due November 2019 is owned by a
wholly owned subsidiary of the company and no cash is required to retire the debt. The company's $125 million
revolver, which currently has nothing drawn, converts to a term loan at the end of 2019 if there is an outstanding

Hovnanian Enterprises Inc.

balance. The company intends to fully withdraw the entire $125 million revolver commitment right before its
expiration and have it convert to the term loan, which will have a final maturity date of December 2022. In addition to
the $83 million of cash already on the balance sheet, the incremental $125 million is more than enough cash to meet
the $75 million obligation due November 2020. As such, the company does not have any significant maturities due
until November 2021. At that time, we are less certain of the company's ability to repay the $195 million of senior
secured notes due.
In addition to the upcoming maturities, we do expect a return to a slow, steady improvement in credit measures after a
weaker-than-expected first nine months of the fiscal year because rising home prices and higher mortgage rates
contributed to weaker demand. This is in addition to the weaker operating results since 2016 as the company
underinvested in its business. The weaker-than-expected demand this year contributed to the company's leverage
being sustained at a higher level than we previously expected as debt to EBITDA increased to 12.3x as of July 2019
from 9.7x as of fiscal year-end October 2018. We currently expect debt to EBITDA of about 12.1x through the end of
2019, with further improvement in 2020 when we expect debt to EBITDA to decline to about 10.5x.

Liquidity
We believe Hovnanian's liquidity is adequate. We expect sources of liquidity to exceed uses by 3.6x or more over the
next 12 months. We believe that sources of liquidity would continue to exceed uses even if forecast EBITDA were to
decrease by 30%. The company has limited need for refinancing since the next significant maturity doesn't occur until
November 2020. The company demonstrated generally prudent risk management by anticipating its liquidity
constraints in 2016 to meet $260 million of maturities by slowing land spending and creating some financial flexibility.

Issue Ratings - Recovery Analysis
Key analytical factors
• We rate the company's $436 million senior secured notes due in 2022 and $416 million senior secured notes due in
2024 'CCC'. The recovery rating is '5', indicating our expectation for modest (10%-30%; rounded estimate: 25%)
recovery in the event of payment default.
• We rate the company's $75 million 9.5% senior secured notes due in 2020 and both the 2% and 5% senior secured
notes due in 2021 'CCC'. The recovery rating is '5', indicating our expectation for modest (10%-30%; rounded
estimate: 25%) recovery in the event of payment default.
• We rate the company's $201.5 million unsecured term loan, maturing in 2027; 13.5% unsecured notes due in 2026;
and 5% unsecured notes due in 2040,'CCC-'. The recovery rating is '6', indicating our expectation for negligible
(0%-10%; rounded estimate: 0%) recovery in the event of payment default.
• We estimate a gross recovery value of about $523 million, which assumes a blended 45% discount to the assumed
$1.2 billion in book value of inventory.

Simulated default assumptions
Our simulated default scenario assumes a default in 2020, burning through its cash position and having trouble
accessing the capital markets to address its 2020 maturities of senior secured notes.
