Overview
Key strengths

Key risks

Third-largest airline in Brazil, but with leading positions in the main
routes it operates--it's the sole operator for about 70% of its routes.

Operates in the cyclical, capital-intensive, and price-competitive airline
industry.

Focus on more regional destinations, allowing greater network
capillarity

Global economic slowdown and trade disputes could affect demand and
exacerbate currency volatility, hampering profitability and leverage.

Solid liquidity position.

Volatile fuel prices and domestic currency swings could affect Azul’s cost
structure.
Geographic concentration, with high exposure to the Brazilian economy.

Better industry fundamentals in Brazil support profitability. Industry fundamentals have been improving since Avianca
Brasil stopped operating and due to the continued disciplined supply management among the remaining three main
industry players, Azul S.A. (B+/Stable/--), Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A. (B/Stable/--) and Latam Airlines Group
S.A. (BB-/Stable/--). This should allow the sector to sustain better load factors and adjusted yields, supporting higher
profitability. Azul also benefitted from Avianca's slots redistribution, so that Azul was able to enter the
Congonhas-Santos Dumont route--Brazil's busiest.As a result, we expect Azul to sustain load factors close to 83% and
EBITDA margins close to 30% over the next couple of years.
A resilient business model and barriers to entry sustain Azul's competitive advantage.Although we see the airline
industry as high-risk, we believe that Azul's network capillarity and strategic position in the Brazilian market somewhat
mitigate the risks of the competitive, cyclical, and capital-intensive airline industry. Azul's strong presence in
underserved markets is possible thanks to its diverse fleet that can fit into many different routes, which enables it to be
the sole operator in many of them, giving it pricing advantages and the ability to capture corporate clients. As a result,
the company has higher revenue per available seat kilometer (RASK) than its competitors, and higher margins, despite
incurring more expensive costs per available seat kilometer (CASK) due to lower economies of scale per flight.

Geographic concentration and cyclical industry weigh on its credit profile.Although Azul does have a significant reach
across Brazil, it is concentrated in a single market, which exposes the company to economic downturns and the
Brazilian regulatory framework. Also, Azul's revenues are mostly generated in Brazilian reais, while part of the
company's operating costs (most notably fuel and maintenance) are linked to the dollar, exposing it to greater volatility
of margins than global companies.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our expectation that Azul will gradually improve its metrics by increasing cash flow
generation, reflecting its fleet management plan, increasing ASK by replacing its E-Jets with the new generation
A320. Its metrics would also improve amid a more favorable market in Brazil after the exit of Avianca. We expect
Azul to maintain its business model, sustaining market leadership in key routes it operates while it improves cash
flow generation. We expect Azul's gross debt to EBITDA to be below 4.5x by the end of this year and below 4.0x
next year, while funds from operations (FFO) to debt will improve to 14%-15% this year and 16%-17% next year.

Downside scenario
A negative rating action would stem from worsening market conditions in Brazil, a hike in fuel prices or greater
currency volatility that could increase Azul's cost structure substantially, worsening its operating performance and
leading to free operating cash flow (FOCF) shortfalls and higher leverage. In this scenario, we would see gross debt
to EBITDA close to 5.0x and FFO to debt of about 12% consistently. A negative rating action is also possible if
volatility in the company's cash generation results in operational cash burn, weakening Azul's liquidity.

Upside scenario
We could take a positive rating action in the next 12 months if Azul were to significantly increase its cash flow
generation, while it maintains a healthier capital structure amid still favorable conditions for the sector. In this
scenario, we would also need to see stronger credit metrics amid relatively stable currency levels. Thus, we could
see gross debt to EBITDA trending to 3.0x, FFO to gross debt of about 30%, and FOCF to gross debt above 15%
consistently.

Our Base-Case Scenario
S&P Global Ratings expects that Azul will continue to work on increasing supply through its fleet management plan,
while it increases operational performance, actively managing its capacity and benefiting from favorable market
conditions.

2.0% in 2020, supporting demand from corporate
and business clients.

• EBITDA margin: 27.5% in 2018, projected at
29%-30% in 2019, and estimated at 31.0%-31.5% in
2020 and 30.0%-31.1% in 2021;

• Brazil's CPI of about 4% starting in 2019, impacting
the company's local costs, including SG&A and
COGS related salaries.

• FFO to debt: 15.2% in 2018, projected at 14%-15%
in 2019, and estimated at 16%-17% in 2020 and
17%-18% in 2021;

• Average exchange rate of R$3.90 per $1 in 2019 and
R$3.95 per $1 in 2020,which impacts fuel,
maintenance, and leasing payments.

• Debt to EBITDA: 4.5x in 2018, projected at
4.0x-4.5x in 2019, and estimated at 3.5x-4.0x in 2020
and 3.5x in 2021; and

• End-of-period exchange rate of R$3.95 per $1 in

forecasted Brent oil prices and average exchange
rate. We expect average Brent oil prices of $60 per
barrel (bbl) in 2019 and 2020.
• ASK to increase close to 25% in 2019 and 2020, as
the company replaces E195 with the A320neo and
expands its routes.
• Revenue passenger per kilometer (RPK) increasing
26% in 2019 and 23% in 2020, reflecting the more
resilient demand for Azul's main routes and the
impact of exit of Avianca Brasil.
• These assumptions result in an expected load factor
of about 84% in 2019 and 83% in 2020.
• Average yields improving about 4% in 2019.
• Capital expenditures (capex) of about R$900 million
in 2019 mainly related to new aircraft, engines, and
equipment.
• Lease liabilities of R$11 billion – R$12 billion in 2019
and R$12 billion – R$13 billion in 2020 to fund
expansion and reflecting the fleet's lower average
age.
• No relevant dividend payout.

Base-case projections
Better industry fundamental and Azul's fleet management plan to support growth and higher margins.We expect Azul
to post ASK growth of 25% in 2019 and 2020 while it maintains load factor of 83%-84%, reflecting more rational
supply management in the sector after the exit of Avianca Brasil, the addition of larger aircraft to the fleet (A320neo)
and replacing some of its smaller E-Jets on longer-haul flights. The A320 should strength its network, while reducing
cost per seats in longer routes.
High liquidity cushion and conservative hedging should diminish volatility. We expect Azul to maintain a robust cash
position in order to lessen the impact of the volatile exchange rates have on costs and on foreign currency debt. Our
base-case scenario also assumes that the company will maintain a hedging strategy of 40% of fuel price for the next 12
months.

Company Description
Azul is a Brazil-based, low-cost airline founded in 2008 with a total fleet of 134 aircraft. The company is the country's
largest airline in terms of domestic departures and cities it serves, with about 822 daily flights. It is the third largest in
terms of ASK. As of the end of 2018, Azul provides air transportation services to 23 million passengers per year to
about 110 destinations through 222 non-stop routes, mainly in Brazil. In addition, the company wholly owns its loyalty
program TudoAzul, which had close to 11 million members as of Dec. 31, 2018. Azul generated revenue of about R$10
billion in the 12 months ended June 30, 2019.

Business Risk: Weak
Azul is Brazil's third-largest airline in terms of market share. The company posted significant growth following the exit
of Avianca Brasil, increasing its market share to 25% in June 2019 from 18% in June 2018, versus Gol's and Latam's
40% and 34%, respectively.

The company focuses on regional airports in economically dynamic areas of the country. This allows Azul to capture a
significant amount of corporate client demand, which has proven to be resilient even during the economic downturn in
Brazil. Also, Azul is the only carrier in about 70% of its routes, and it has a leading position in seven out of the ten
largest domestic airports in number of departures in Brazil. This business model allows the company to charge higher
average ticket prices, bolstering margins and RASK above those of competitors, despite incurring greater CASK due to
lower economies of scale per flight.
Although the company has small presence in international routes, it has been expanding its alliances with international
carriers--mainly TAP and United Airlines--through code share agreements, improving commercial cooperation, and
synergies. Azul also counts on its own frequent flier program, TudoAzul.

Financial Risk: Aggressive
We expect Azul to continue improving its operating cash flows, offsetting the higher volumes of operating lease debt
due to depreciation of the currency, and fleet renewal and expansion. Higher operating cash flows will allow the
company to deleverage gradually. Lower Brent prices, lower capacity additions following Avianca Brasil's bankruptcy,
price adjustments, as well as Azul's efficient fleet and route strategies will also support deleveraging. We expect the

Azul S.A.

company to maintain a high cash position and use only a part of it to prepay debt, which is a conservative strategy for
its liquidity and offsets potential negative effects from volatility in exchange rates and the cyclical demand in the airline
business. We expect debt to EBITDA to be in the 4.0x-4.5x range by the end of 2019 and 3.5x-4.0x in 2020, while FFO
to debt remains between 14% and 16% for the next two years.

Liquidity: Adequate
We view Azul's liquidity is adequate. Given robust cash position, forecasted cash generation, and manageable debt
amortization schedule, we expect liquidity sources to surpass uses by more than 1.2x in the next 12 months and that
sources will continue to exceed uses even if EBITDA declines by 30%. Azul is subject to debt-payment acceleration
covenants under some of its debt contracts, which require adjusted net debt to EBITDA to be lower than 5.5x to 6.5x
(depending on the contract) and interest coverage greater than 1.2x, both of which we expect the company to meet

Azul S.A.

with significant headroom.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Cash position of R$1.4 billion as of June 30, 2019;
and

• Short-term debt of R$227 million as of June 30,
2019;

• Expected cash FFO of about R$1.3 billion in the next
12 months.

• Annual capex of about R$900 million;
• Working capital outflows of R$242 million in the
next 12 months; and
• No dividend payout.

Debt maturities
As of June 2019, Azul had the following debt maturity profile, not including the hedge impact on its senior unsecured
note:
Chart 3

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 6, 2019 11

Azul S.A.

Covenant Analysis
Compliance expectations
As of December 2018, the company's debt totaled R$822 million under the acceleration-type covenants. The
covenants are mostly related to Azul's debentures (9th and 10th issuances) and to aircraft financing. The company's
operating lease agreements or bonds don't have financial covenants, although the bonds have the usual cross-default
provisions with other relevant debt amounts and events of default. Azul was compliant with such clauses as of
December 2018, and according to our projections, it will be able to comply with those covenants over the next few
years, and with about 30% cushion in the next 12 months.

Requirements
The covenants require maximum leverage of 5.5x to 6.5x Debt to EBITDA (depending on the contract) and adjusted
debt service coverage ratio of 1.2x.

Other Credit Considerations
We believe that Azul's sizable amount of dollar-denominated debt on an adjusted basis and its exposure to unhedged
fuel costs could add volatility to margins and financial metrics. This is because dollar-denominated operating costs
outweigh revenue in the same currency, given that about 50% of the company's total costs are linked to foreign
currency, while foreign currency revenue is likely to represent about 10% of total revenues in 2019. Therefore, we view
Azul's capital structure as negative, as its financial metrics remain exposed to currency mismatches that could lead to
covenant pressures if the Brazilian real were to weaken sharply. However, we believe Azul compares favorably with its
peers in the 'B' rating category. This stems from Azul's strategy of operating in markets with little or no competition,
which generate higher margins than for domestic peers. It also reflects the company's policy of hedging all of its
foreign currency debt and interest expenses from exchange rate volatility amid a significant cushion in its liquidity. We
also consider that Azul has contingent assets consisting of a portion of TAP's convertible bonds, which are
denominated in euros and are a source of foreign currency, given their face value.

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 6, 2019 12

Azul S.A.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

The airline industry is subject to long-term risks from environmental and social factors. But we don't view them as
a considerable rating driver for Azul. The prevalence of unions in the airline industry leads to moderately high
social risks; 100% of Azul's employees are unionized. In addition, the industry has high public visibility regarding
safety, noise, and other factors. In order to adapt to the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International
Aviation (CORSIA), as of 2019, the Brazilian National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC) requires all carriers to report
their CO2 emission levels. It is part of implementing environmental obligations under Chicago Convention, of
which Brazil is a signatory.
Azul has been reducing its CO2 emission per ASK through the renewal of its fleet for more technological and fuel
efficient models. Also, its average fleet age is 5.9 years, significantly lower than those of most large airlines in the
U.S. (average of 10 to 16 years). And Azul aims to reduce fuel consumption in the future. We assess Azul's
management and governance as fair, because we believe management has a solid knowledge of the airline
industry, amid absence of high turnover with many of directors working in the company since its inception.

Issue Ratings - Recovery Analysis
Key analytical factors
The 'B+' rating on Azul's senior unsecured note due 2024 is at the same level as the issuer credit rating, reflecting a
recovery rating of '4' with an average recovery expectation of 45% (rounded) for unsecured creditors. Although most of
Azul's fleet is under operating and financial leases, the issue-level rating reflects the company's non-aircraft related
debts, which are mostly unsecured. We analyze Azul's recovery under a going concern scenario, because of the size of
the company's operations in Brazil, which benefit from little or no competition, and given that we don't expect other
players to replace Azul should it cease to operate. These factors lead us to believe that the company would likely be
restructured in a distress scenario.
Our valuations reflect our estimate of the value of the various assets at emergence adjusted for expected realizations
rates in a distressed scenario. Under this scenario, we believe Azul's available assets would be enough to meet its
secured loans and about 45% of its unsecured loans.

Simulated default assumptions
• Simulated year of default: 2023
• We apply an overall haircut of about 70% to Azul's asset base, including about 80% dilution rate to its cash position,
because the company would likely use part of its cash position to fund working capital needs and repay more
expensive loans in a distress scenario.
• We apply a 5% cut for administrative expenses.
• Therefore, we arrive at a gross enterprise value of about R$2.3 billion.
