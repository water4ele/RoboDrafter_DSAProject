Key Risks

Largest pure-play owner and operator of medical office
buildings (MOBs).

Although its tenant base is well-diversified with sizable exposure to
investment-grade tenants, cash flow stability could be adversely impacted by
struggling physician groups or hospitals.

Steady and favorable demand characteristics with an aging
population and increased patient volume directed to
outpatient settings.

An influx of private equity capital into more defensive sectors/property types such
as MOBs could dampen the company's external growth prospects.

Above-average asset quality given a well-located portfolio
and strong relationships with major healthcare systems.

While less likely to impact demand for MOBs than some other healthcare facility
types, legislative and regulatory changes could impact future cash flows.

Healthcare Trust of America Inc. (HTA) is the largest pure-play MOB health care real estate trust (REIT), with a
well-diversified portfolio by geography and tenant base. HTA's large scale platform, with gross real estate investments
of approximately $7 billion, is well-diversified across key metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) with no market
representing more than 10.5% of ABR and no tenant accounting for more than 4.6%. Moreover, given secular trends
across the health care industry, such as a transition to lower-cost settings and increased outpatient care, we believe
HTA's portfolio is well-positioned to continue delivering solid operating performance.
Approximately 95% of HTA's properties are located on-campus and/or aligned with a major hospital or health care
system, which we believe inherently leads to increased tenant demand and higher retention ratios. As of June 30, 2019,
HTA derived approximately 92.5% of ABR from its MOB portfolio and 94.4% based on gross leasable area (GLA).
Coupled with an investment-grade tenancy of approximately 45% (based on rents) and solid occupancy levels, we
have a favorable view of HTA's asset quality.

Outlook: Stable

S&P Global Ratings' stable outlook on HTA reflects our view that the company will be a net acquirer in 2019,
funding growth in a leverage-neutral manner and maintaining relatively stable credit metrics. The outlook also
assumes properties will continue to deliver low-single-digit net operating income (NOI) growth, supported by
limited reimbursement volatility and strong demand as health care systems look to lower costs by shifting delivery
to outpatient settings.

Upside scenario
We could raise the rating over the next 12-24 months if the company moderately improves its credit protection
measures such that S&P Global Ratings's adjusted debt-to-EBITDA declines to the mid- to high-5x area with
fixed-charge coverage (FCC) remaining above 3.5x. The company would need to execute any meaningful
acquisitions in a leverage-neutral manner. Furthermore, we would also need to see operating metrics remain in line
with historical performance.

Downside scenario
While highly unlikely over the next 12-24 months, we would consider a downgrade if HTA purses a significant
debt-financed expansion of its relatively new development platform or its pace of acquisitions accelerates such that
debt-to-EBITDA rises above 7x on a sustained basis. We could also lower the rating if the company experiences
meaningful operational disruptions with one of its key hospital affiliates.

• Real GDP growth of 2.5% in 2019 and 1.8% in 2020;
• Same-property revenue growth in the range of 2% to

• Development spending of approximately $100
million to $150 million over the next two years; and
• Dispositions of approximately $75 million in 2019
and around $100 million in 2020.

Base-case projections
Same-property revenue growth in the 2%-3% range in both 2019 and 2020.We believe HTA is well-positioned to
benefit from favorable industry tailwinds such as an aging population and the significant increase in outpatient care
relative to care delivered at a hospital setting. Coupled with this favorable backdrop, HTA's relatively long weighted
average lease term of approximately 5.7 years and a well-staggered lease expiration schedule should result in steady
cash flows and continued solid occupancy.
We expect HTA to be a net acquirer in 2019 with the majority of completions expected to occur in the second half of the
year. Following the $2.75 billion Duke MOB portfolio acquisition in 2017, HTA was a net seller in 2018; however, our
expectation is that HTA will expand its asset base modestly in 2019 by predominantly targeting smaller acquisitions as
opposed to larger portfolio deals. Moreover, we expect HTA will remain disciplined in utilizing its relatively new
in-house development platform to supplement acquisitions. As of June 30, 2019, HTA's development pipeline was 70%
pre-leased, which we view favorably, as MOBs can often take years to fully lease up.
We expect credit protection measures to remain relatively stable over the next two years. As of June 30, 2019, HTA's
adjusted debt-to-EBITDA was 6.3x and its FCC was 4.0x. We expect these ratios to remain relatively stable over the
next two years with adjusted debt-to-EBITDA projected to remain in the high-5x to low-6x area and FCC in the
high-3x to low-4x range. We believe HTA is committed to maintaining a relatively conservative financial policy, and
that it will continue to grow its portfolio in a leverage-neutral manner.

Company Description
HTA is a publicly traded REIT that acquires, owns, and operates primarily medical office buildings in the United
States. The company was founded in 2006 and is headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona. As of June 30, 2019, HTA had
an undepreciated asset base of approximately $7 billion and a total enterprise value of around $8.3 billion.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
In our opinion, HTA has the leading market position in MOBs, which we believe was materially enhanced from the
$2.75 billion acquisition of Duke's MOB portfolio in 2017. In addition, our assessment of the company's business risk
profile incorporates HTA's large platform (approximately $7 billion of gross real estate investments) and
well-diversified tenant base (no tenant represented more than 4.6% of ABR as of the second quarter of 2019).
Furthermore, HTA's top ten tenants collectively represented 24.2% of ABR with its top three tenants, Baylor Scott &
White Health (AA-/Stable), HCA Healthcare Inc. (BB+/Stable), and Highmark Inc. (A/Stable) accounting for 4.6%,
3.8% and 3.0% of annualized base rents, respectively.
As of June 30, 2019, HTA owned and operated 431 properties representing 23.3 million square feet of GLA in 32
states. Although we consider HTA's portfolio to be well-diversified geographically, the company's operations are tilted
towards the Southwest, from which it derived 35.6% of ABR as of the second quarter of 2019. Nonetheless, no single
market accounted for more than 10.5% of ABR and its top three markets were Dallas (10.5%), Houston (6.6%), and
Boston (6.4%).

Chart 4

MOBs represented 92.5% of ABR (and 94.4% of GLA) as of the second quarter of 2019. Approximately 68% of HTA's
GLA is located on a hospital or medical center campus (creating strong tenant demand and high tenant retention),
while 27% is off campus but affiliated with a major health care system. Additionally, as of March 31, 2019, 45% of the
company's tenants were rated investment grade, an increasingly important factor given cost containment pressures
and the deteriorating health of certain hospital systems.
MOBs currently benefit from favorable tailwinds, including an aging population and the fact that care is being directed
away from higher-cost settings, such as hospitals, and towards outpatient settings. Ultimately we think these factors
allow HTA to earn 2%-3% contractual same-store net rental rate increases, despite leases being predominantly
structured as triple-net leases. Moreover, these favorable lease terms have high retention rates, resulting in lower
capital expenditures. Further, the mostly private-pay asset class currently compares favorably to other health care
REIT facility types, as senior housing continues to experience new supply pressure and skilled nursing has seen
numerous operators forced into restructuring given reimbursement challenges and rising labor costs.

Financial Risk: Intermediate
We consider HTA's prudent funding strategy, relatively low leverage, and manageable debt maturity schedule as credit
positives. As of the 12 months ended June 30, 2019, S&P Global Ratings' adjusted debt-to-EBITDA was 6.3x,
compared to 5.7x at year-end 2018. Despite the modest recent increase, we believe HTA's financial policy has
remained relatively conservative and we expect them to continue operating with leverage in the high-5x to low-6x area
over the next few years.
HTA has a largely unencumbered asset base (with only 1.6% of secured debt to total undepreciated assets), relatively
low weighted average cost of debt (3.5%), and largely (approximately 95%) fixed rate debt structure as of June 30,
2019. Notably, in June 2019, HTA entered into a forward equity agreement under its at-the-market (ATM) program
whereby the company agreed to issue 1.8 million shares of common stock in exchange for approximately $52.1 million
of net proceeds to be delivered prior to June 2020. Overall, we believe the company's relatively strong track record of
leverage-neutral acquisition funding and consistent operating performance will lead to generally stable credit metrics
over the next few years.

Liquidity: Strong
We view HTA's liquidity as strong, as we expect its sources of liquidity to exceed uses by at least 1.5x or more over
the next 12 months. Our assessment of the company's liquidity profile incorporates the following expectations and
assumptions:
• Sources less uses will be positive, even if forecasted EBITDA declines by 15% (a REIT-specific threshold for strong
liquidity);
• Sufficient covenant headroom for forecasted EBITDA to decline by 15% without the company breaching covenant
tests;
• The likely ability to absorb high-impact, low probability events without need for refinancing;
• Well-established and solid relationships with banks; and

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
For real estate companies, we typically rate the senior unsecured debt the same as the issuer credit rating unless the
percentage of secured debt exceeds 35% of total undepreciated assets (or 40% of the fair market value of assets).

Analytical conclusions
The majority of HTA's properties are unencumbered, and the ratio of secured debt to undepreciated assets was 1.6%
as of June 30, 2019, which is well below the threshold of 35%. Therefore, we rate the company's unsecured debt 'BBB',
the same as the issuer credit rating. We believe the company has some flexibility to pursue additional secured debt for
refinancing purposes without jeopardizing the current unsecured debt rating.
