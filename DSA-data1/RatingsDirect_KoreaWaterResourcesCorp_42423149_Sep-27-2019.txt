Overview
Key Strengths

Key Risks

The sole government-owned national scale builder and operator of
wholesale water supply infrastructure in Korea.

High debt due to large capital investments needs.

Steady operating performance supported by a solid market position.

Government's tight control of tariff hikes, allowing only reasonable cost
recovery and resulting in lower margins than global peers'.

Ongoing financial support from the government.
Strong presence in domestic capital markets and low funding costs.

Ratings remain equalized with that on the government of Korea. This equalization mainly reflects Korea Water
Resources Corp.'s (K-Water) position as the sole government-owned national scale builder and operator of wholesale
water supply infrastructure in Korea (AA/Stable/A-1+). The company plays a key role in waterworks management
and water supply (about 50% market share), flood control (over 90%), as well as hydro power generation from
multi-purpose dams (around 60%). We therefore see an almost certain likelihood of extraordinary government support
for K-Water in the event of financial distress.
Stable regulations and resilience of water demand to economic downturns should support steady operating
performance. Turnaround of K-Water's waterfront complex development and favorable operating conditions for hydro
power should also support earnings. Overall, we estimate the company will maintain EBITDA of Korean won (KRW)
1.0 trillion-KRW1.2 trillion in 2019-2020, similar to 2016-2018.
Steady earnings and ongoing government support would prevent any significant debt increase.The government
provides capital injection to K-Water every year to support investments that involve production of public water
resources. We expect this trend to continue with annual capital injection of KRW300 billion-KRW400 billion every year
in 2019-2020. Moreover, K-Water is likely to gradually reduce its debt over the next two to three years, helped by a
turnaround in cash flow from its Busan Eco-Delta City (EDC) project.
Debt should remain high. We expect K-Water to continue to maintain high capital expenditure (capex) of KRW0.8
trillion-KRW1.0 trillion over the next two years. This is mainly for maintenance and improvement of waterworks, and
for waterfront complex development. This ongoing investment, which is larger than K-Water's operating cash flows,
will prevent significant improvement in credit metrics over the next two to three years. We estimate the ratio of debt

to EBITDA will stay at 9x-11x in 2019-2020.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook on K-Water reflects the outlook on the sovereign credit rating on Korea because we equalize the
rating on the company with that on the sovereign. The rating equalization reflects our expectation of an almost
certain likelihood that the government will provide extraordinary support if the company faces financial distress.
We expect K-Water's stand-alone credit profile to remain at 'bbb-' over the next 12-24 months. Our view is based
on the company's steady operating performance supported by its strong position in Korea as a major
government-related entity for water utilities, the government's continued capital injections, and the company's
gradually declining, although still high, debt.

Downside scenario
We would lower our rating on K-Water if we downgrade Korea. In addition, a weakening of K-Water's role as a
policy arm of, or the company's link to, the government could put pressure on the rating.

Upside scenario
We would raise the rating on K-Water if we upgrade Korea.

Our Base-Case Scenario

SEPTEMBER 9, 2019 4

Korea Water Resources Corp.

Assumptions

• Real GDP growth in South Korea of 2.0% in 2019
and 2.6% in 2020, compared with 2.7% in 2018. Rise
in water demand to generally track GDP growth.
• Steady water demand and stable tariffs in Korea,
which should support K-Water's topline.
• Stable EBITDA of KRW1.0 trillion-KRW1.2 trillion
each in 2019 and 2020, similar to the 2017-2018
level, given that large portion of the company's
profit still comes from steady water supply-related
business.

• High annual capex of KRW0.8 trillion-KRW1.0
trillion in 2019 and 2020, compared with KRW0.9
trillion in 2018, due to spending on waterworks
maintenance and improvement and development of
waterfront complex.
• Government capital injections of KRW300
billion-KRW400 billion each in 2019 and 2020,
covering full interest costs and part of the principal
of debt related to the four river restoration projects
and public waterworks.

Base-case projections
Annual revenue growth of 0%-3% in 2019 and 2020. We expect growth in K-Water's waterworks revenue (40% of total
revenue in 2018) to be broadly in line with the low-single-digit growth in Korea's GDP. The company's revenue from
dams operations (16%) should remain steady due to favorable business environment. We expect revenue from its
waterfront complex development (17%) to grow at 5%-15% as land sale from the Busan EDC project accelerates
towards 2021.
Consistent and reasonable recovery of costs. The government has enabled K-Water to recover almost all of its
operating costs for waterworks by adjusting tariffs. This is reflected in the waterworks business' stable operating
margin of about 10% in 2016-2018. We expect a correlation between the rate adjustment and Korea's inflation rate, as
seen in the 4.8% tariff hike in September 2016. However, some uncertainty exists on the timing of tariff adjustment,
which we estimate will normally happen in every two to four years. We expect the company's other businesses to
maintain profitability, given a stable operating environment.
Operating cash flow to rise. As the sale of Busan EDC accelerates, K-Water will be able to improve its operating cash
flow in 2019-2020. The company's working capital was hit by early-stage cash outflows for the waterfront development
projects in the past two years. Under our base case, we expect the company's operating cash flow to grow to KRW500
billion-KRW900 billion in 2019-2020 from KRW324 billion in 2018. We estimate KRW150 billion-KRW400 billion
improvements in annual cash flow will come from the development of waterfront complexes.

SEPTEMBER 9, 2019 5

Debt to decline modestly in 2019-2020. Despite K-Water's high capex, we expect the company to be able to secure
cash flows to pay down debt. However, the discretionary cash flows for debt repayment are likely to still be modest
compared to the total debt level. We expect K-Water's debt to remain at KRW10 trillion-KRW12 trillion, broadly
similar to or slightly lower than KRW11.9 trillion in 2018. Under our base case, we estimate the company's
debt-to-EBITDA ratio to be near 10x.

Company Description
K-Water plays a central role for the Korean government in the development and management of water resources. The
company was established in 1967 under the K-Water Act.
K-Water's main business is construction, operation, and management of wholesale water supply infrastructure such as
dams and multi-regional waterworks. The company also engages in property development of industrial complexes and
special-purpose zones, mostly related to waterfront development.

K-Water is fully owned by the Korean government and Korea Development Bank (government-owned), and abides by
the Korea Water Resources Corporation Act. The company benefits from continued financial support from the
government, which usually comes in the form of capital injection or government agency revenue.

Business Risk: Strong
We believe K-Water will maintain its strong position as the sole government-owned national scale builder and operator
of wholesale water supply infrastructure in Korea. In our view, K-Water plays an essential role of providing stable
water supply in the country that has significant seasonal water scarcity and floods.
K-Water is likely to continue to have a dominant market share in water-related business--local governments have the
remaining market share in many cases. Further, the company's assets are diversified across Korea and it has a diverse
customer base, including regional waterworks and industrial units.
In our view, K-Water has satisfactory operating efficiency. It has maintained good water quality, meeting acceptable
service standards with reliable service.
We expect the Korean government to continue to allow K-Water to recover almost all its operating costs by adjusting
tariffs every two to four years. The cost base for water-related businesses is low with limited exposure to cost of raw
material, which supports the company's stable margins. In addition, the government allows K-Water to develop
waterfront areas for industrial complexes, from which the company can generate cash flow to support its public role.
K-Water's profitability is lower than global peers'. We attribute the lower profitability mainly to the company's policy
role of supplying stable water resources to the public at reasonable rates. In our base case, we estimate K-Water will
maintain stable but low profitability, with EBITDA margins of 32%-34% over the next two years, compared with 32.9%
in 2018.

We view global rated water utility companies such as Wessex Water Services Ltd. and Rand Water as comparable
peers of K-Water.
K-Water's scale and diversification are stronger than that of its peers. The company covers the entire nation and has a
diversified customer base without any significant counterparty risk.
Wessex and Rand Water are better placed than K-Water in terms of government regulations, backed by their
supportive regulatory framework. The two companies have a record of recovering operational expenses and all other
associated costs in a timely manner. Although the water price in Korea helps K-Water to consistently recover costs, we
view the timing of adjustment as less transparent and less predictable.
K-Water's profitability is lower than that of Wessex mainly due to its public policy role.
Similar to K-Water, the peers have a strong safety record, and reasonable cost controls, water quality management,
and record of operations.
K-Water's financial ratios are much weaker than its global peers'. This is mainly due to its large debt incurred while
executing the Korean government's major projects in the past.

Financial Risk: Aggressive
We expect K-Water to modestly reduce its debt with improvement in cash flows over the next two years. However, the
company's leverage is likely to remain high, given its significant debt balance and ongoing investment needs.
K-Water's debt significantly increased during 2009-2011 to fund the government's restoration projects for Korea's four
major rivers. Since 2016, to lessen the burden of increased debt, the government has supported the company's
financing costs and repayment of principal associated with the projects in the form of capital injections.
We expect K-Water to continue to benefit from relatively low borrowing costs owing to its strong standing in the credit
markets as one of the major government-related entities in Korea. This enables the company to maintain a strong
interest coverage ratio despite the high debt.

Liquidity: Adequate
We assess K-Water's liquidity as adequate. We expect strong ongoing support from the government to enable the
company to fund its large short-term debt maturities and capital investments. We estimate K-Water's ratio of liquidity
sources to liquidity uses to be 1.2x-1.4x over 2019.
We believe K-Water will continue to benefit from preferential access to debt markets in Korea and support in financial
markets to raise debt in a timely manner, as it has done in recent years. That's because the company is one of Korea's
most important government-related entities.

Covenant Analysis
K-Water does not have any significant financial covenants on its borrowings.

Government Influence
We see an almost certain likelihood that the government of Korea will provide K-Water with timely and sufficient
extraordinary support in the event of financial distress. We base our view on K-Water's:
• Critical role to the government and the national economy as the sole government-owned national scale builder and
operator of wholesale water supply infrastructure. In our view, K-Water operates essentially on behalf of the
government and its main purpose is to provide a key public service that a private entity couldn't readily undertake.
• Integral link with the government owing to the government's full ownership of the company and tight management
and supervisory control through the Ministry of Environment. The government closely monitors K-Water's financial
policies, including the budget and major investments. It also has a record of providing financial support to the
company every year, mainly in the form of capital injections.
