Key Risks

One of the largest car parking operator group globally, managing about 2.3
million parking spaces in 10 countries.

Given the group's need to continue to expand the business, its
financial leverage is likely to remain stable, but relatively high.

Market-leading position in France, where the company generates about 75%
of its global proportionate EBITDA, and it has been consolidating in north and
south America.

Changes in automotive industry and mobility patterns, combined
with recent green policies, could threaten the car park industry in
the long term.

Stable cash flow generation from its long-term concession contracts that have
historically shown good retention rates of about 80%-90%.
The group's strong business model gives it solid margins for the sector--for
example, its adjusted EBITDA margin is 44%-46%.

The group's 2018 performance was in line with our expectations and its financial ratios were comfortably within the
thresholds for the current rating. Total adjusted revenues increased by 2% in 2018, mainly because the group gained
new concessions. It reported EBITDA of €295.5 million and successfully maintained its EBITDA margin above 44%.
The resulting financial ratios--debt to EBITDA at 5.4x and FFO to debt at 13.1%--support the rating.
The company has divested from noncore European markets to strengthen its position in the leading markets it serves.Its
operations in the U.K., Slovakia, Germany, and Czech Republic contributed less than 6% to total global proportionate
EBITDA in 2017. Following the disposal of these operations in 2018, we expect the company to reinforce its position
in its core European countries--France, Spain, Belgium, and Switzerland--by focusing on ownership acquisition, which
give it more flexibility in terms of tariff, operating model, and services offered, without renewal risk.
It plans to pursue a strategy of prudent expansion in emerging markets.Its growth strategy will require prudent risk
management and will mainly involve forming joint ventures with local partners and signing contracts that carry no
market risk. After successfully adopting this strategy in Latin America and North America, we expect Indigo Group to
adopt the same approach in its prospective markets in Asia.
Green policies and changes in automotive industry and mobility patterns could pose long-term challenges to the
industry. For example, local municipalities, particularly in certain European countries, may adopt green policies that
limit access to city centers and restrict the type of vehicles admitted. They may also reduce greenfield opportunities.
Car-hailing opportunities, combined with the development of electric and autonomous cars, could also threaten the

Indigo Group S.A.S.

parking industry in the long term. In line with peers, the company is working to develop mobility and digital solutions
to capture opportunities and defend its market position, while expanding its geographical presence outside Europe.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook indicates that Indigo Group is expected to maintain adjusted FFO to debt at about 12%-13%
over the next two years through revenue growth and cost optimization. These ratios provide a good degree of
headroom to the rating.

Downside scenario
We could lower the rating if, in our view, Indigo Group was not able to maintain its FFO-to-debt ratio comfortably
above 10%. This could result from higher-than-expected shareholder distribution or an acquisition strategy not
supported by adequate EBITDA growth due to stagnant revenues or falling operating margins.
We could also consider a downgrade if the company significantly changed its business mix so that exposure to
non-infrastructure business--such as management contracts and short-term leases--increased to about 30% of
EBITDA. This would likely cause adjusted EBITDA margins to fall below 30% and so weaken our view of the
company's business risk profile.

Upside scenario
We could raise the rating by one notch if the company was able to maintain its FFO-to-debt ratio sustainably
above 13% while committing to a predictable financial policy.

Our Base-Case Scenario
Our base-case assumptions incorporate Indigo Group's recent sale of its operations in noncore European markets and
its most recent acquisitions. Traffic trends and tariff growth on the existing perimeter are based on our macroeconomic
growth assumptions for the countries where the company operates, which in our view largely drive operating
performance.

Assumptions

• Annual revenue growth of 1.5% in 2019 and 3.5% in
2020 in France, in line with our estimated real GDP
growth of 1.4%-1.5% and consumer price index
(CPI) growth of 1.3% in the period, plus new
contracts and organic growth. Indigo's acquisition of
Spie Batignolles' parking business in 2019 offset the
negative impact of the increase in real estate taxes
in Paris and the activities of the "yellow vest"
protesters.

• In the eurozone, the deconsolidation of noncore
business still weighs on revenue growth in 2019,
partially offset by the full-year results from Besix
Park. Existing operations in the eurozone are
expected to grow in line with our forecast of real
GDP growth (1.1% in 2019 and 1.4% in 2020) and
CPI (1.3% in 2019 and 1.4% in 2020).
• Consolidation of Canadian subsidiary West Park in
June 2019 and relatively stable EBITDA generation
in North America and Brazil suggesting that
exposure to demand risk has fallen, and therefore
that margins will be lower, but more stable.
• Capital expenditure (capex) of about €250
million-€300 million in 2019 and €80 million-€100
million in the following years, primarily driven by
the acquisitions announced this year and potential
projects in the pipeline;
• Dividends of €80 million-€100 million per year;
• Additional concession fee liabilities of €110 million
in 2019 and €60 million-€70 million going forward.
Under International Financial Reporting
Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) 12, the fixed
concession fee liabilities are included in the reported
debt. They are difficult to predict as they are subject
to the awarding of new concessions.
• Successful issuance of a €100 million tap of the
1.625% fixed-rate 2028 bond, as well as a 20-year
€150 million 2.25% annual coupon private
placement. The transactions were completed in
June and July 2019, respectively.

Base-case projections
Revenue likely to decline in 2019 because of Indigo's strategic exit from noncore markets. Following the disposal of its
subsidiaries in Germany, the U.K., and Slovakia, we expect the group's revenue to decline by about 4% in 2019, but to
recover by approximately 4%-5% the following year, reflecting completed acquisitions and the high amount of capex
included in our forecasts.
Focus on leading markets will sustain the group's EBITDA margins at around 44%-46%. We expect S&P Global
Ratings-adjusted EBITDA margin to remains at 44%-46%, because of the group's high exposure to concession
business, slightly offset by exposure to soft currencies and lower margins in Brazil and the international segment.
Metrics will weaken slightly as the new acquisitions and contracts mature. FFO to debt is forecast to slightly decline to
about 11.5%-11.9% given the high capex expected in 2019-2020. This will be financed from the proceeds of the
disposals. We expect financial leverage to remain 6x on average.

Company Description
Indigo Group S.A.S. is one of the largest car park operators globally. Its headquarters and core operations are in
France. Through Indigo Infra S.A. and its subsidiaries, the group operates off-street and on-street car parks in 10
countries, including Spain, Belgium, and Switzerland in Europe, as well as Canada, the U.S., and Brazil. It has over
5,050 car parks, more than 2.3 million managed parking spaces (on-street and off-street), and offers on-street
enforcement services in France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain, and the U.S.
Indigo Group has expanded internationally through acquisitions and partnerships with local operators. In Western
Europe (particularly in France, Spain, and Belgium), it maintains a concession-type of business that generates high
levels of profitability. In emerging markets, it has entered into short-term and no demand-risk type of contracts that
require low investments, but generate low margins. The group also includes a mobility and digital solutions subsidiary
aimed at developing a mobility services and payment software platform, although its contribution to total revenues is
negligible at this stage.

The group's ultimate parent is Infra Foch TopCo, of which 98.4% was initially owned by Ardian and Crédit Agricole
(Predica). These companies acquired the company from French contracting group Vinci S.A. in June 2016.
In March 2019, Ardian had entered into exclusive negotiations to sell its equity stake to Mirova (Natixis asset manager)
and MEAG (Munich Re and Ergo asset manager). In September 2019, the transaction was completed, following the
approval by the relevant anti-trust authorities. Under the new ownership structure, Predica holds 47.1% of the shares,
Mirova 32.9%, MEAG 14.2%, treasury shares 0.5%, and the remainder by the management of the group. At this stage,
we do not expect any material change in the company's business model or financial policy, as we understand that
Mirova and MEAG are infrastructure-type of investors that have experience in and knowledge of the car park sector.
We don't anticipate a sale would trigger the potential consolidation of the LAZ Parking subsidiary in the U.S.--Ardian's
exit would not qualify as a change-of-control event.
The group's employees and management hold the remaining stake.

Business Risk: Strong
Our assessment incorporates the group's solid business model, which focuses on long-term off-street concessions,
ownership, and long-term leases in Western Europe. These provide relatively predictable cash flows with EBITDA
margins of about 40%-70%, in line with core infrastructure companies. In emerging markets, the group has favored
short-term leasing contracts that require lower investment, but yield lower margins, and management contracts that
carry no exposure to demand risk.

In France, its main market, the group holds a leading position and generates about 75% of its global proportionate
EBITDA. Despite the social unrest, new municipal tax in Paris, and some slowdown in Paris city center traffic, we
understand that the acquisition of Spie Autocite in June 2019 reinforced the group's position and cash generation in
France.
The company continues to expand its leading position in Western Europe, with the acquisition of Belgium-based Besix
Park in July 2018. In Latin America, it undertook an additional 10% stake in its Brazilian subsidiary AGE in October
2018. Despite its increasing exposure to countries that have soft currencies, we consider that the group's plans to
expand overseas enhance its diversified profile in terms of municipalities, locations, and number of contracts. This is
key to success in the car parking business, which is very local.
Moreover, the combination of limited available space in city centers and the group's good historical retention rate of
expiring contracts forms an effective barrier to entry. We estimate that it retains 80%-90% of contracts on expiry.

Peer comparison
Compared with MEIF 5 Arena Holding (previously EMPARK), the market leader in Spain and Portugal, Indigo Group
benefits from higher reported margins due to its lower exposure to noninfrastructure business. MEIF5's on-street
segment generates around 15% of its total EBITDA, and around 30% of its parking spaces are operated under

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 20, 2019 9

Indigo Group S.A.S.

management contracts, which means shorter contracts and higher volatility in cash flow, despite its 90% retention rate.
APCOA Parking Holdings GmbH is the market leader in Germany, Italy, the U.K., and Scandinavia. Its business model
focuses on leasing and management contracts. As a facility service provider, it benefits from limited need for capex
and lower EBITDA margins than infrastructure peers.
Cofiroute S.A. operates various concession contracts and is the fifth-largest rated toll road network operator in Europe.
The toll road operator has a significantly stronger EBITDA margin than Indigo Group. This is consistent with the
stronger business risk profile of a large and mature toll road network under the supportive French regulatory
framework.

FFO to debt of 12%-13% over the next two years. Because it has been awarded new concessions, it will have
additional concession liabilities. We expect cash flow from operations and the proceeds from the asset disposals to be
sufficient to support the planned capex without materially increasing leverage.

We continue to analyze the group on a consolidated basis, based on the accounts of Infra Foch TopCo, as the ultimate
parent. That said, the parent does not bear any additional financial debt, apart from a €347 million convertible bond
that we currently treat as equity.

Liquidity: Strong
We view Indigo Group's liquidity as strong, given that we expect liquidity sources to exceed uses by about 3.0x in the
12 months ending March 2020 and that sources would exceed uses even if forecasted EBITDA declined by 30%. We
anticipate that the company would be able to sustain high-impact low-probability events without need for refinancing
and it has solid relationships with banks.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• €297 million of unrestricted cash and equivalents;

• Debt maturities of about €34 million attributable to
payments of fixed concession fees reported on the
balance sheet;

• €300 million of undrawn committed revolving credit
facilities, which mature in the end of 2023;
• €250 million new notes issued in June and July
2019; and

• Capex of about €235 million; and
• Dividends of about €80 million.

• FFO of about €230 million-€240 million.

SEPTEMBER 20, 2019 12

Indigo Group S.A.S.

Debt maturities
Other than the group's concession fees, reported as debt, there is no significant debt maturing in the near future.
There are no financial covenants on existing debt.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
The 'BBB' issue rating on Indigo Group's notes reflects that all the notes are senior unsecured and the amount of debt
at subsidiaries' level is limited.

Capital structure
Indigo Group's capital structure comprises about €1.6 billion senior unsecured debt (excluding future concession fees),
as of Dec. 31, 2018, of which €43 million is attributable to the group's subsidiaries. Indigo Group also reports about
€330 million in additional financial debt related to net present value of future concession fees. The €347 million
convertible bond at Infra Foch TopCo bears an 8% interest rate, which is paid through dividends received from the
Indigo Group.

Analytical conclusions
Indigo Group's existing debt is rated 'BBB', at the level of the issuer credit rating, because the amount of debt located
at the level of Indigo Group's subsidiaries is limited to about €43 million. In our subordination analysis, we deduct
financial debt related to the future concession fees, as this is not third-party debt. Convertible bonds at the holding
level are held solely by Infra Foch TopCo shareholders and consequently are not exposed to a third party.

Reconciliation
Our main analytical adjustments to reported financials are as follows:
• We increase the reported debt by operating lease adjustments, in line with annual payment information received by
the company.
• We include in the debt pension liabilities.
• We consider about €15 million of cash as restricted as it represents payments due to municipalities.
• We include in our adjusted debt the value of the put option held by the noncontrolling interest in the AGE Brazilian
subsidiary, as well as liabilities related to employee savings mutual fund and long-term remuneration plans (€26.4
million).
• We deduct from both revenues and operating expenditures the amount related to construction services.
• We are no longer treating the shareholder loan as equity, given its early reimbursement following the refinancing in
April 2018.
