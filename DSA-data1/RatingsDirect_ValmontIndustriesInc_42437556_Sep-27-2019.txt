Overview
Key Strengths

Key Risks

Leading market position within its key niche markets

Exposure to highly cyclical construction and agricultural end markets

Good global diversity with one-third of sales outside of U.S.
international distribution network

Balanced acquisition and growth policy, amidst continued shareholder-friendly
activities

Diversified product mix and relatively low customer
concentration

Short-term demand weakness in irrigation segment due to weak macro
sentiment and trade war uncertainties

History of stable EBITDA margins and flexible cost structure
Prudent leverage metrics with strong liquidity

We expect discretionary spending to remain in line with debt to EBITDA of about 2x for the next 12-24 months based on
Valmont's consistent financial policy. Valmont's financial policy of undertaking bolt-on acquisitions to increase market
share in key growth markets, investing in its asset base, and distributing cash to shareholders should continue
supporting debt to EBITDA of 1.5x-2x. We expect debt to EBITDA of 1.8x for 2019, which means Valmont will have a
tighter cushion under its credit metrics but is still within our expected range for the current rating. However, we do not
expect Valmont to increase leverage above 2x by undertaking additional debt to finance discretional spending.
We expect adjusted EBITDA of $350 million-$400 million in 2019 and 2020, supported by robust backlogs for the
engineering support structures (ESS) and utilities support structures (USS) segments, restructuring efforts and growth
from acquisitions. We expect EBITDA improvement in 2019 supported by pricing discipline across all segments, stable
raw material prices, and profitability improvements from restructuring efforts in 2018. We anticipate S&P Global
Ratings' adjusted EBITDA margins improving to about 13% in 2019 and 2020. However, we note weak demand
affecting the irrigation segment, weak market conditions in the international offshore wind market, and negative
foreign exchange movements, as seen during the first half of 2019, could partially offset earnings growth from recent
acquisitions in 2019 and 2020.
Valmont benefits from its global footprint and wide product range serving diversified end markets; however, its business
performance is highly correlated to general macroeconomic conditions.Valmont generates approximately one-third of
its revenues from outside the U.S. with manufacturing and distribution facilities in Australia, China, and Europe. It also
has good breadth of products across four distinct, but cyclical, segments, which cater to different markets, including,
infrastructure, utility sector, coatings, and irrigation market. While Valmont's end markets can demonstrate cyclical

Valmont Industries Inc.

investment patterns, its geographic and product diversification can help limit downside as other regions may
experience different demand conditions. For example, in the irrigation segment, international sales from Brazil,
Europe, and the Middle East helped partially offset weak North America and Australian demand.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects S&P Global Ratings' view that Valmont Industries Inc.'s credit measures will remain
solid over the next two years despite some short-term weakness in some of its segments. Specifically, uncertainty
around tariffs and trade policies, potential project delays, and lower capital spending by some customers, primarily
in the Asia-Pacific region could result in some earnings volatility. We believe some of these issues will be partially
offset in the second half of 2019 and 2020 by healthy demand in its coatings segment and North American
engineered support structures. We also believe the company will benefit from efficiency gains and higher pricing as
higher raw material costs are passed along to customers. This should lead to adjusted debt to EBITDA of 1.5x-2x
and funds from operations (FFO) to debt of 45%-55% over the next two years.

Downside scenario
We could lower our ratings on Valmont over the next two years if weak irrigation and renewable energy
end-market demand weakness persists through 2019 such that adjusted EBITDA margins fall below 10%, causing
adjusted debt to EBITDA to rise above 2x and operating cash flow (OCF) to debt to fall below 35% for a sustained
period.

Upside scenario
We view an upgrade as unlikely over the next 24 months unless Valmont significantly strengthened its overall
business by substantially increasing its size and scope and increasing adjusted EBITDA margins above 18% while
reducing earnings volatility. Notably, we would expect Valmont to finance any additional acquisitions in a
leverage-neutral manner. Ultimately, if the company were able to achieve these hurdles and sustain adjusted
leverage comfortably below 1.5x and FFO to debt of more than 60% for a prolonged period, we could consider an
upgrade.

• Over this time, adjusted EBITDA margins to
improve slightly to roughly 13% to 14% as the
company benefits from lower raw material costs

• Capital expenditures (capex) of roughly $95 million
annually.
• Valmont to continue making opportunistic share
repurchases over the next 24 months (as it has over
the past several years), which we believe will range
at about $60 million to $80 million annually. At the
same time, the company will also maintain its
annual dividend payouts of about $30 million to $40
million to shareholders.
• The company will remain acquisitive over the next
24 months given its history and large cash balance.

Base-case projections
We expect solid demand growth in several of Valmont's markets in the ESS and USS segments to offset weak demand in
the irrigation segment and headwinds from foreign exchange volatility. Poor weather conditions in the first half of
2019, lower net farmer's income, and weaker sentiment driven by trade war uncertainties are hurting demand for
Valmont's irrigation products as farmers hold off on capital investment. However, increasing investments in upgrading
and strengthening electrical grids as well as solid order levels from North American transportation and wireless
communication investments are driving healthy backlogs in its USS and ESS segments. As a result, we expect revenue
growth of about 2% in 2019 despite unfavorable currency exchange rates from the strengthening dollar affecting
international revenues. In 2020, we expect revenue growth to recover to 3%-4% as demand from the solar tracker
business improves and infrastructure and utility investment growth continues.
We expect Valmont to generate around $200 million of free operating cash flow to go toward shareholder distributions,
acquisitions, and reinvestment into the asset base. We expect reduced working capital needs from stable input prices
and improved profitability from restructuring efforts in 2018 to boost free cash flow generation this year. We believe
the company will generate sufficient cash to return approximately $100 million to its shareholders (share repurchases
and regular dividends) and additional $100 million towards capex, while continuing its acquisition strategy.

Business Risk: Satisfactory
Our view of Valmont's business and operating prospects incorporates its favorable positions in niche markets,
including the irrigation pivot market (slightly less than 50% share), utility round and monopole market (about 40%
share), and steel lighting pole market (about 25% share). In addition, Valmont benefits from its global distribution
network with a strong international presence and good product and market diversity. Moreover, we believe the
capital-intensive nature of the markets and high switching costs, given the niche products acts, as significant barriers to
entry for new players. However, relative to other companies within the broader building materials industry, we
consider Valmont's business constrained by its size, highly cyclical end markets, and exposure to steel price volatility.
In general, Valmont's margins are more adversely affected during periods of rapidly rising steel prices, than when steel
prices are increasing more modestly, because it is unable to pass prices to its customers as quickly as they are rising.
Prices are typically more resilient under rapidly declining steel prices, as seen this year with current spot prices of $600
per short ton 30% lower than last year. Robust demand and solid service levels in the ESS segment are supporting
prices, as such Valmont's margins should benefit this year following the steel price spike in 2018. Valmont has
exposure to cyclical end markets that are closely linked to broader macroeconomic conditions, such as government

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 11, 2019 6

Valmont Industries Inc.

spending on infrastructure development, wireless communications investment, oil and gas exploration spending, and
net farmer's income. For example, in the irrigation segment, weak commodity prices and macroeconomic sentiment
impact demand as farmers hold off on capital investments. Valmont's cyclicality was evident in 2015 when EBITDA
declined by 30% as low agriculture commodity prices and weaker infrastructure investment from governments led to a
sharp decline in Valmont's end market demand.
Despite the volatility of steel prices and weak farmer sentiment, we expect the company to maintain adjusted EBITDA
margins of 13%-14% over the next two years, helped by recent acquisitions and improved operating efficiencies from
restructuring efforts in the ESS and USS segments. Valmont has spent $80 million so far this year on bolt-on
acquisitions. These include Valmont's recent acquisition of Connect-It Wireless that should expand the company's
wireless component distribution network and the remaining shares outstanding of United Galvanizing Inc., which will
further expand Valmont's position in the North America coatings market.

Financial Risk: Modest
In our view, Valmont's credit measures will remain solid over the next two years despite some short-term weakness
caused by lower demand in its irrigation segment. We believe some of these issues will be partially offset by strong
backlogs in the ESS and USS segments and more stable raw materials, and incremental revenues from recent
acquisitions, along with efficiency gains from additional restructuring activities. This should lead to fully adjusted debt
to EBITDA of 1.5x-2x, FFO to debt of about 40%, and OCF to debt of 35%-40% over the next two years.
We continue to expect the company to fund its capital-allocation plans from free cash flow and to include regular
dividends to shareholders, a moderate degree of share repurchases, consistent capital spending plans, and acquisitions
funded in a leverage-neutral manner. Specifically, we anticipate slightly higher OCF of about $250 million to $300
million in 2019, helped by working capital management improvements and more stable raw material costs, to fund
Valmont's capital spending ($90 million to $100 million annually), dividends ($30 million to $40 million annually), and
share repurchases (approximately $220 million remaining on the current program). We also expect the company to
fund all acquisitions (announced and completed) year to date with available cash on hand.

Liquidity: Strong
We view Valmont's liquidity to be strong based on the following observations and estimates:
• An expectation that liquidity sources (including availability under the company's $600 million revolving credit
facility) should exceed uses by more than 3x over the next 24 months.
• An expectation that liquidity sources would continue to exceed uses even if forecast EBITDA were to decline by
50%.
• Sufficient covenant headroom for forecast EBITDA to decline by 30% without the company breaching coverage
tests, and debt of at least 25% below covenant limits.

Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Cash balance of approximately $257 million as of
June 30, 2019;

• Minimal scheduled debt amortization of $0.8 million
annually;

• Availability of approximately $556 million (net of the
$15 million in letters of credit and $30 million
outstanding as of June 30, 2019) under the revolving
credit facility maturing in October 2022; and

• Capex of approximately $95 million annually;

• Cash FFO in the range of $270 million and $290
million annually over the next 24 months.

• Dividends of approximately $30 million to $40
million annually;
• Seasonal working capital requirement of $30 million;
• Modest working capital outflows of about $5 million
to $10 million in each of the next two years; and
• We assume annual share repurchases of about $70
million over the next 12 months to 24 months.
• We believe the company will remain acquisitive and
continue to spend its excess cash flows into strategic
associations.

Debt maturities
Valmont maintains a favorable debt maturity profile with a weighted-average maturity of six years and its nearest
maturity of the $600 million revolving credit facility due in October 2022.

Covenant Analysis
Compliance expectations
We do not expect any covenant issues over the next two years under our base case forecast. As of June 29, 2019, the
company was in compliance with all covenants related to the debt agreements with leverage ratio of 2.48x and
coverage ratio of 7.67x.

Requirements
Valmont is subject to two financial covenants, which include a maximum leverage ratio (debt to EBITDA) of 3.5x and a
minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.5x.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
As of June 30, 2019, Valmont had approximately $750 million in total debt outstanding, which consisted primarily of
unsecured debt at the parent level.

Capital structure
• The company's $600 million revolver (October 2022 maturity) had availability of about $556 million as of June 30,
2018.
• Unsecured notes of $450 million due 2044, and $305 million due 2054.

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 11, 2019 10

Valmont Industries Inc.

• The company also has $8.5 million in industrial development revenue bonds due 2025, as well as short-term
borrowing of $11 million.

Analytical conclusions
We rate Valmont's debt 'BBB+', the same as the issuer credit rating, since the issuer has sufficiently low leverage and
no significant elements of structural or contractual subordination risks are present in the capital structure, in our view.
