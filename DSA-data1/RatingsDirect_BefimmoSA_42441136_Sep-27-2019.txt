Good-quality office assets, with the majority of the portfolio in the Brussels central
business district (CBD), where demand for office properties is relatively good

Large redevelopment pipeline (18% of gross asset value),
especially due to the ZIN project (€375 million), which
will be responsible for a temporary increase in leverage

Long-term leases of seven years, on average, excluding buildings under redevelopment
such as the ZIN project (which already signed an 18-year lease) and Quatuor project
(15-year lease), and a high share of public tenants (65%) supporting stable and
recurring rental income generation

Temporary deterioration of asset quality as Befimmo
S.A. sells some core assets to fund the redevelopment
pipeline; high-quality assets entering the portfolio in the
coming years will gradually offset this

Strong pre-letting activity, with 74% of current committed ongoing projects already
pre-let, partially mitigating risk of vacancy inherent of redevelopment projects

Relatively small size of portfolio compared with that of
similarly rated peers

Moderate debt leverage, with adjusted debt-to-debt-plus-equity of 40%-45% and
EBITDA-interest-coverage exceeding 4x, although high debt-to-EBITDA of close to
10x partially moderates this

The Brussels office leasing market being less dynamic
than that of Paris, and with some oversupply in
decentralized areas where Befimmo's share of assets is
about 8%

Befimmo recently increased its riskier redevelopment activities, which it funds with debt and proceeds from asset
disposals. Belgium-based property investment company Befimmo S.A.'s total committed redevelopment pipeline
today represents about 18% of its portfolio value. This is higher than its long-term average and most of real estate
rated peers, which generally limit this exposure to 5%-10% of their portfolio value. S&P Global Ratings believes
redevelopment activities typically carry risks such as cost overrun, vacancy at completion, or unexpected drop in
rental market rates during the construction cycle.
Strong pre-leasing characteristics should partially mitigate the increased redevelopment risk.We acknowledge the
company's particularly strong ability to pre-lease its redevelopment projects well in advance, with 72% of its
committed ongoing projects already pre-let. This partially shields Befimmo from the risk of future vacancy, and attests
to the attractiveness of its projects under redevelopment. We note the pre-leasing of 70,000 square meters (sq. m.) of
office space in the ZIN building (out of the 110,000 sq. m. multifunctional project) to Flemish authorities with an
18-year lease and expected delivery by 2023; the pre-leasing of 100% of the Brederode Corner project; and one-third
of the Quatuor project two years before delivery.
Planned assets disposals should limit leverage increases from the increased redevelopment pipeline, but will temporarily
deteriorate the portfolio's overall quality. To maintain a moderate leverage with adjusted debt-to-debt-plus-equity
below 50%, Befimmo will partially fund its redevelopment pipeline with assets disposals. On April 20, 2019, the

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 12, 2019 2

Befimmo S.A.

company announced the sale of the Pavilion Building (in the Leopold district of Brussels) for €93 million. We expect
the company to sell €100 million-€250 million in office assets in the next two years.
Befimmo has identified potential assets for sale, most of which we consider as mature but still appealing and core
under its strategy, which means they enjoy a central location and good tenant demand. Therefore, we anticipate a
slight and temporary deterioration of the portfolio size and quality in the coming years, falling to about €2.5 billion in
2019-2020 from €2.7 billion currently, and with the share of CBD space decreasing to about 58% of rental income from
about 62%. That said, the situation should only be temporary, because projects entering service in 2021-2023 should
increase the portfolio size to more than €3 billion and the share of assets in CBD space to more than 65%.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook continues to reflect Befimmo's stable and predictable rental income from its good-quality office
property portfolio and long-term leases with trustworthy tenants. The outlook also reflects our expectation that
Befimmo will maintain an EBITDA interest coverage ratio of at least 3.5x and an adjusted debt-to-debt-plus-equity
ratio of less than 45% over the next two years.

Downside scenario
We could lower our ratings on Befimmo in the next 24 months if the company's credit metrics were to deteriorate
more than anticipated, with sustainable debt-to-debt-plus-equity (S&P Global Ratings-calculated) exceeding 45%.
This could result from lower-than-anticipated assets disposals, higher-than-expected development capital
expenditure, unexpected decline in valuations.
At the same time, a negative rating action could follow an extended deterioration of Befimmo's portfolio's quality
and size, which could result in EBITDA-interest-coverage ratio decreasing close to 3.5x. This could happen if
Befimmo were to sell off more prime assets than anticipated.
We might also consider lowering the rating if the company's business model became riskier, with for example a
substantial proportion of revenues coming from co-working spaces management, or more redevelopment activities
draining on liquidity.
Credit stress could also come from lower-than-anticipated sources to cover upcoming debt maturities, dividends,
and large redevelopment capital expenditures (capex) in the next 12 months that could deteriorate our liquidity
assessment.

Upside scenario
An upgrade would depend on Befimmo's ability to improve its sustained adjusted debt-to-debt-plus-equity ratio to
near 35%, with EBITDA interest coverage remaining comfortably above 3.5x.
An upgrade would also require Befimmo to build a track record of rental growth on a like-for-like basis and a
marked change in the company's earnings base, with improved diversification of income streams.

Our Base-Case Scenario
Assumptions

• Slightly positive like-for-like rental income growth in
the next two years. We assume GDP growth in
Belgium will remain positive in the 1.3%-1.5% range
for the next 24 months. In addition, the good
sustained economic momentum and the decrease in
supply of CBD office space should contribute to
positive lease renewals
• Stable-to-slightly decreasing occupancy in the
93.5%-94.5% range in 2019-2020, due to the sale of
core assets that typically have a high occupancy. We
forecast this will reverse as projects enter service.
For instance, Brederode and ZIN have pre-let all
their office space

• Relatively flat portfolio valuation in the forecast
period reflecting our anticipation of yields
stabilization in the coming 24 months
• Overall portfolio value will decrease temporarily of
the sale of assets happening before redevelopment
projects starting up.
• Annual capex of €120 million-€130 million in the
following two years, reflecting the intensive
redevelopment pipeline in place. These mainly
include the remaining investments for the Quator,
Brederode, and ZIN projects
• No acquisitions planned in the forecast period. We
understand the company will focus on its substantial
current redevelopments
• Asset sales of €200 million-€350 million in
2019-2020, including the already signed sale of
Pavilion building for €93 million. We anticipate the
company will continue selling assets to partially fund
its redevelopment capex
• 9.4% of Befimmo shares that we conservatively
considered as representing €100 million of
additional equity, versus €130 million-€140 million if
considering the current market capitalization

Base-case projections
Credit ratios should improve in 2019 due to assets disposals, but they are likely to deteriorate in 2020 as projects ramp
up. Befimmo announced in February its intention to increase asset rotation to capitalize on strong market momentum,
and also partially fund its upcoming redevelopments. Therefore, we expect credit metrics to improve in 2019, before a
noticeable deterioration in 2020 resulting from the ramp-up of committed redevelopments. Still, the ratios will remain
compatible with Befimmo's financial risk profile and the rating. We expect cash outflows from redevelopment projects
to peak in 2020-2021.

Company Description
Befimmo operates in the office real estate segment, with a focus on Brussels (68.9% of portfolio value) and, to a lesser
extent, Luxembourg (4.6%). The company's portfolio consists of more than 100 buildings, with a total value of €2.6
billion as of year-end 2018. It is listed on Euronext Brussels with a market capitalization of about €1.5 billion (as of July
2019). Befimmo has B-REIT status (regulated Belgian Real Estate Investment Trust).

Business Risk: Satisfactory
Our business risk assessment reflects Befimmo's good predictability in cash flow generation, including long leases
terms of about seven years (excluding the 18-year lease recently signed for ZIN building), high occupancy of about
94%, and the significant portion of public tenants (about 65% of rental income) that we view as creditworthy, such as
the Belgian public sector and the EU Commission.
Befimmo recently intensified its redevelopment activity, which will be partially funded by core assets disposals, but
that will likely result in particularly long leases. The total committed redevelopment pipeline represents about 18% of
the portfolio value, which is higher than its long-term average and that of most rated real estate peers that generally
limit their exposure to more risky redevelopment activities to 5%-10% of their portfolio value. The company recently
launched large redevelopment projects, such as the 110,000 sq. m. mixed-used ZIN project for a total investment of
€375 million; and the 60,000 sq. m. offices building Quatuor for €157 million.
To fund this, Befimmo is selling off mature and high-quality centrally located assets, such as the recently announced
Pavilion building. As a result, the company's share of assets in the Brussels CBD will temporary shrink to about 58% in
2020 from 62% currently. However, the deterioration in portfolio size and quality should only be temporary because
the majority of the projects under redevelopment are large buildings in the Brussels CBD.
The business risk profile also reflects Befimmo's relatively small portfolio size of about €2.6 billion as of Dec. 31, 2018

which compares negatively with that of similarly rated peers such as Merlin Properties (€12.2 billion as of March
2019), CPI Property Group (€7.6 billion as of December 2018), or Alstria Office REIT-AG (€3.9 billion as of March
2019). We believe a small-scale portfolio exposes holding companies to the risk of revenue volatility in the case of
asset or tenant rotation. In addition, Befimmo has high rent concentration, mainly in a single market in Brussels, which
is still recovering and significantly less liquid than other Western European office markets such as Paris and Berlin.

Financial Risk: Intermediate
We base Befimmo's financial risk profile on relatively low leverage, as our adjusted debt-to-debt-plus-equity ratio of
close to 45% (44.6% at year-end 2018) and a solid EBITDA interest coverage of about 6x at year-end 2018 indicate.
Supporting the strong coverage ratio is the relatively high-yield environment in Befimmo's main markets (5.9% of
EPRA net initial yield at year-end 2018 versus 3.2% for Societe Foncière Lyonnaise in Paris, for example). This also
reflects the company's low cost of debt, which improved to 2.01% in 2018 (compared with 2.08% in 2017) due to
higher usage of inexpensive commercial paper and other short-term instruments. We believe that Befimmo will likely
maintain adequate hedging and back-up credit lines to limit any significant interest-rate-related risks in the
medium-to-long term.
Befimmo's credit metrics are also burdened by a relatively high debt-to-EBITDA ratio at about 10.0x, highlighting the
high cost of capital and low yield relative to the capital-intensive nature of Befimmo's business, especially due to its
significant development pipeline; and still lower yield than) some other riskier asset classes or geographical exposures.
Our assessment of Befimmo's financial risk profile captures in the company's financial policy, targeting a loan-to-value
(LTV) ratio of maximum 50%, which is commensurate with the weaker end of our intermediate category.
We expect Befimmo to sell €200 million-€350 million of assets in 2019-2020 while the ramp-up of redevelopment
projects should start by 2020. As a result, we expect our adjusted debt-to-debt-plus-equity ratio to improve to close to
40% in 2019, before deteriorating in 2020. However, we expect the company to maintain this ratio below 45%
sustainably.
Because asset sales will reduce EBITDA while projects are still under redevelopment, we anticipate
EBITDA-interest-coverage and debt-to-EBITDA ratios to deteriorate, to close to 4x and 11x-12x in the coming years,
respectively.

Liquidity: Adequate
We assess Befimmo's liquidity as adequate because we anticipate that the ratio of liquidity sources to uses will be near
1.2x for the 12 months from March 31, 2019.
We consider that the company has well-established and solid relationships with its banks, with a generally high
standing in the credit markets. The adequate liquidity assessment also includes our view of Befimmo's generally very
