We expect CSC's contracted property sales growth to remain moderate in fiscal 2020 and 2021.We believe China South
City Holdings Ltd. (CSC) will continue to deliver 7%-9% contracted property sales growth over the next two fiscal
years. The moderate growth is driven by its residential and commercial apartments. Most of CSC's saleable resources
are located in tier-two cities with stronger demand for real estate, such as Chongqing and Zhengzhou. Residential sales
will account for 50%-60% to total sales over the next two years, and commercial apartments for a 30%. Trade
center-sales are weakening and will account for 10%-20% of sales, down from close to 60% in fiscal 2016.

CSC is slowly chipping away at elevated leverage. CSC's leverage is high and will remain so, however we expect to see
marked improvements. The debt-to-EBITDA ratio fell to 9.5x in fiscal 2019 (ending March 31, 2019), from 12.3x in
fiscal 2018. We expect CSC's leverage to further trend down to 8.1x-8.4x in fiscal 2020 and 2021, given the company's
positive operating cash flow supported by steady contracted sales growth, growing recurring income, and controlled
spending on land acquisitions and capital works.
Liquidity is tight but improving. We assess CSCs' liquidity to be less than adequate with cash sources around 1.1x cash
user over the 12 months from March 2019. This is due to CSC's significant short-term debt maturities of Hong Kong
dollar (HK$) 15.3 billion, versus only HK$7.2 billion unrestricted cash on hand. Having said that, we believe the
short-term refinancing is manageable. This is because most of the short-term borrowings are in the form of bank loans
which we expect can rolled over with longer tenors, given they are secured by the company's large
investment-property portfolio. Longer-tenor refinancing will help CSC to reduce its maturities profile and hence mildly
boost liquidity.

Outlook: Positive

The positive outlook reflects our view that CSC will continue to deleverage with controlled land acquisitions and
satisfactory contracted sales over the next 12 months. We also believe that the company will see a mild
improvement in its liquidity and capital structure, such that it is able to source refinancing and manage near-term
debt maturity.

Upside scenario
We may upgrade CSC if the company's contracted sales and operating performance strengthens such that its
debt-to-EBITDA improves to below 9x and EBITDA interest coverage is stable at 1.5x or above. At the same time,
we would expect CSC's liquidity to further improve to comfortably above 1x liquidity sources over uses and its
weighted-average maturity profile lengthens to above two years.

Downside scenario
We may revise the outlook to stable if CSC's deleveraging is weaker than our expectation with the debt-to-EBITDA
ratio deteriorating back to above 9x. This could be the result of contracted sales slippage or debt-funded
acquisitions. We could also revise the outlook back to stable if CSC's EBITDA interest coverage falls significantly
below 1.5x, which could happen due to higher interest expenses or weaker sales than our expectation. We could
also revise the outlook to stable if CSC's liquidity sources over uses weakens to below 1x.

Our Base-Case Scenario
Assumptions

• China's property residential sales to increase by
12%-15% in 2019, likely driven by a 2%-3%
expansion in gross floor area and a 10%-12% rise in
the average selling price (ASP).
• CSC's contracted sales growth to remain less
correlated than peers' to overall national contracted
sales growth. This is because CSC focuses less on
property development due to its large portfolios of
trade centers, versus other similar rated property
developers.

• CSC's contracted sales to grow by 7.0%-8.0% in
fiscal 2020 to HK$15.8 billion-HK$16 billion, from
HK$14.7 billion last year.
• Property development revenue to increase by
14%-15% to about HK$9 billion in fiscal 2020 and by
8.0%-9.0% to about HK$10.0 billion in fiscal 2021,
tracking prior years' contracted sales growth.
• Other revenues from property rentals, property
management, e-commerce, logistics and
warehousing, and outlet mall operations to grow by
13%-15% for the next two fiscal years.
• The overall gross margin to decline slightly to
41.0%-42.0% in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 and to
below 40% in fiscal 2022 from 43.0% in fiscal 2019.
• The EBITDA margin will track gross margin and
decline slightly to 32.0%-34.0% in the next two fiscal
years from 35.5% in fiscal 2019.
• Construction cash outflows to be HK$4.5
billion-HK$5.0 billion each for the next two fiscal
years based on budgeted new starts and completion
schedules.

Base-case projections
We expect margins to trend down slightly on lower-margin project deliveries: After maintaining relatively stable gross
margins at 43.0% in fiscal 2019, a slightly decline to 42.0%-41.0% is likely in fiscal 2020 and 2021, due to higher
revenue contribution from commercial properties. We forecast the gross margin will fall below 40.0% in fiscal 2022.
Commercial properties generally have a gross margin of about 35.0%-40.0%, slightly lower than that of 40.0%-45.0%
for residential properties.

EBITDA interest coverage expected to remain stable at 1.5x. Despite a mild increase in the average cost of borrowing,
EBITDA interest coverage at 1.5x in fiscal 2019 came in better than our expectation of 1.2x-1.3x. We expect the ratio
to remain stable at 1.5x in fiscal 2020 and 2021 with controlled financing cost and further debt size reduction. The
sound interest coverage ratio should provide good support to the company in terms of refinancing loans backed by
investment properties.

Company Description
CSC derives 20%-25% of its revenues from various business lines within its trade centers in China, including
fashion-retail outlets, operating e-commerce platforms, and warehousing management and logistics services. The
company also offers property management services to tenants in its trade centers.
CSC's property developments are located around its existing trade center locations, and account for more than 70% of
total revenue. It engages in the development of residential units in addition to "gongyu" apartments (which tend to
have shorter leasehold period) and multi-purpose office units.
CSC was founded in 2002 and is listed on the Hong Kong stock Exchange. Mr. Cheng Chung Hing and his family
members together hold 35.7% of CSC, while Tencent Holdings Ltd., the second largest shareholder, has an 11.8%
stake.

Business Risk: Weak
We believe CSC will continue to face pressure from weak sales in its trade-center business amid challenging industry
conditions. However, we believe this is somewhat offset by its increasing fast-churn, high asset turnover business of
residential sales. Recurring income from various businesses is also expanding. As a result, we expect moderate growth
in CSC's contracted property sales over the coming two years.
Trade-center sales are unlikely to pick up meaningfully over the next two years, despite the company's heavy past
investments in this segment. Contribution from trade center sales to total contracted sales will fall to 10%-20% or
HK$1.5 billion–HK$2.0 billion for the next two years.
We see the residential segment as the catalyst for sales growth, owing to resilient demand for affordable residential
housing across the tier-two cities in which CSC operates. In fiscal 2019, contribution from residential and apartment
sales increased to 75% to total sales, versus 35.0% only in fiscal 2016.

We forecast projected sales of HK$16.0 billion in fiscal 2020, up from HK$14.7 billion in fiscal 2020. This will be driven
by favorable residential sales as well as robust office and apartment sales due to new launches in the tier-2 cities of
Xi'an and Zhengzhou.
That being said, the sustainability of residential sales performance in the longer term is still uncertain. We estimate the
company's residential land bank can only support sales for the next 2-2.5 years. Some of this uncertainty is mitigated
by strong apartment sales; this segment saw HK$1.6 billion in sales in 2019, a major acceleration from HK$64.6 million
in fiscal 2018. CSC has a track record of converting its commercial land bank (or trade-center land bank) into
commercial apartment development without paying significant land premium.
Apart from property development income, recurring income which comprises of rental, property management,
logistics and warehousing, outlet mall operations and e-commerce, is also a core revenue source for CSC. Income from
these sources contributed well over 20% of the revenue in fiscal 2019 and is expected to grow by 13.0%-15.0% over
the next year, to HK$2.6 billion–HK$3.0 billon.
We believe the recurring income will be a stable and key contributor to revenue, helping alleviate any potential
volatility in contracted sales. These revenues have high stickiness given their locations near expanding residential
clusters and because CSC is the sole-service provider to the tenants. We believe the population inflow into the trade
center zones stemming from the completion of residential projects along with new tenants, and new project launches

should further boost recurring income. Infrastructure completions such as the opening of metro lines will also help
CSC's trade center rental business.
Chart 3

Peer comparison
We view Hopson Development Holdings Ltd. (B/Stable/--) and Xinyuan Real Estate Co. Ltd. (B/Negative/--) as CSC's
closest peers.
Both CSC and Hopson have similar revenue distribution with about 65.0%-75.0% of the revenue contributed from
property development and 25.0%-35.0% contributed from other businesses. Whereas, for Xinyuan, 97.5% of the
revenue is derived from development and the rest from rental. Within development, CSC derives almost 75% of its
contracted sales from residential properties and 25% from trade-center and commercial apartment sales. Hopson and
Xinyuan only develop residential properties.
Hopson's other revenue mainly comes from property rentals, which reached HK$2.0 billion in 2018, covering about
60%-70% of interest expense. This is behind our positive comparative-rating assessment on Hopson. CSC's property
rental revenue of close to HK$800 million in fiscal 2019 covers one-third of interest expense. That said, when
combined with other revenues from logistics and warehousing and outlet operations, recurring income covers about
60.0% of CSC's interest expense.
CSC and Hopson are relatively better diversified than Xinyuan. CSC operates in eight cities, with projects in

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 17, 2019 8

China South City Holdings Ltd.

Zhengzhou and Hefei contributing 24.4% and 35.3% respectively of contracted sales in fiscal 2019.Hopson focuses on
three economic zones—the Yangtze River Delta (50% of contracted sales), Pearl River Delta (34%) and the Bohai Rim
(16%). Xinyuan has limited diversification, with more than 40% of contracted sales derived from Zhengzhou.
Hopson has a biggest land bank among peers at 29.2 million sqm. Xinyuan's is 5.2 million sqm, sufficient for three to
four years of development. CSC has a relatively thin residential land bank that can develop for the next 2-2.5 years. .
All three peers are highly leveraged companies. CSC's ratio of debt to EBITDA is about the same as Hopson's at about
9.5x. Xinyuan's leverage is smaller at 6.5x due to controlled land acquisitions.
Accordingly, Xinyuan's interest coverage ratio is better at 1.9x, versus 1.6x for Hopson and 1.5x for CSC.
Hopson's weighted-average maturity of 2.9 years is longer when compared to CSC's 2.1 and Xinyuan's 2.0 years. The
liquidity conditions for CSC and both its peers remain tight with assessments of less than adequate, as the sources
cover the uses by only a thin margin.

Financial Risk: Highly leveraged
We expect CSC's leverage to improve continuously, but remain high over the next 12-18 months. CSC should be able
to pay down its high levels of short-term debt and refinance with longer tenors, with increasing reliance from
investment property-pledged bank loans. As result, liquidity will mildly improve.
The company's deleveraging efforts should bring its ratio of debt to EBITDA to 8.1x-8.4x in fiscal 2020 and 2021,
supported by controlled land acquisitions and tame capital expenditure. We estimate CSC will budget at HK$2
billion–HK$3 billion over the next two years, or only 15%-20% of the contracted sales target. Its capital expenditures
on investment properties will trim to around HK$1 billion each year, versus HK$3.5 billion in fiscal 2019.
CSC will continue to extend its maturity profile with refinancing of longer-tenor bank loans. The bank loans in
particular are likely to refinance with longer tenors. This is given the maturing development of the company's
investment property portfolios, which can be used as collateral and help improve the debt maturity profile of the
company. Recent new loans and drawdowns have been done at maturities of more than two years.
Overall, we expect debt levels to decline by 5.0% in fiscal 2020 and grow moderately thereafter as the company mildly
reaccelerates land banking spend. This is a key factor in the declining leverage trend.

Liquidity: Less than adequate
We assess CSC's liquidity as less than adequate, primarily due to limited unrestricted cash against large short-term
debt. In our base-case scenario, the company's cash sources over cash uses will be around 1.1x during the 12 months
to March 2020.
However, the tight liquidity is partly mitigated by some of the short-term debt being bank financing pledged by
projects or investment properties, which should be easier to roll over or extend. We believe CSC also has additional
flexibility to seek refinancing through the pledging of unencumbered investment properties valued at more than HK$14
billion.
We have not included HK$13 billion in bank credit lines in our analysis of liquidity due to their uncommitted nature.
We believe CSC has a well-established position in both the domestic and offshore capital markets and has sound bank
relationships including with Agricultural Bank of China Ltd., Bank of China Ltd., China Construction Bank Ltd., and
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd.

Issue Ratings - Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
As of March 31, 2019, CSC's capital structure consisted of HK$17.8 billion of secured debt, mostly in the form of
secured bank borrowings, and HK$4.2 billion subsidiary-level unsecured debt, mostly domestic bonds. CSC's total debt
amounted to HK$34.3 billion and priority debt ratio reached 64%, above our 50% notching-down threshold for the
issue rating.

Analytical conclusions
We rate CSC's outstanding senior unsecured notes one notch lower than the issuer credit rating to reflect the material
subordination risk. This is because the senior unsecured notes are subordinated to existing secured debt and
subsidiary-level debt securities.
