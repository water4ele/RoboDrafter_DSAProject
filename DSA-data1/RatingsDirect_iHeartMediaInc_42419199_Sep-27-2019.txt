Overview
Key Strengths

Key Risks

Position as the largest radio broadcaster in the U.S. provides scale and
geographic diversity across U.S. markets.

Operating performance is susceptible to cyclicality since 60% of
revenue comes from advertising.

Healthy free operating cash flow (FOCF) generation supports deleveraging.

Broadcast radio faces structural pressures from digital disruption.
Elevated leverage of 5.8x.

Around 60% of iHeartMedia's revenue comes from broadcast radio advertising, which is likely to face
pressure during an economic downturn.
iHeartMedia generates revenue primarily by selling airtime to local and national advertisers. Core advertising revenue
(excluding political) is tied to expectations for consumer spending, which drives advertising budgets, such that revenue
is likely to decline during an economic downturn. We believe core broadcast radio advertising would decline at a
greater rate than GDP in a recession.

iHeartMedia's scale provides a competitive advantage relative to other radio companies.
iHeartMedia's size meaningfully surpasses peers, making its platform more attractive to national advertisers looking for
reach. National advertising contributes around 40% of iHeartMedia's broadcast radio advertising revenue compared to
around 20% for Entercom (the second-largest radio broadcaster). Additionally, iHeartMedia can bundle advertising
inventory across its broadcast, digital, and event platforms to capture incremental advertising dollars.

We expect adjusted net debt to EBITDA of 5.4x-5.6x in 2019 will decline to 4.7x-4.9x in 2020.
iHeartMedia emerged from bankruptcy on May 1, 2019, reducing its leverage to about 5.8x (from around 10x), which
we believe is still high for a radio broadcast company given its exposure to cyclical advertising revenue and
competition from alternative media. We expect the company will generate more than $200 million in FOCF in 2019
(after one-time reorganization costs) and more than $300 million in 2020, which it will use primarily for voluntary debt
repayment to reduce leverage to more moderate levels.

SEPTEMBER 6, 2019 2

iHeartMedia Inc.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our expectation that leverage will approach 5x over the next 12 months due to a
combination of voluntary debt repayment and low-single-digit percent EBITDA growth, supported by modest
revenue growth and cost-saving initiatives.

Downside scenario
We could lower the rating if leverage remains above 5.5x over the next year due to weak operating performance
from operational missteps following emergence, increased competition from alternative media, or an economic
downturn that causes a pullback in advertising spending. Alternatively, we could lower the rating if leverage
remains above 5.5x over the next year because cash flow is directed toward acquisitions or dividends rather than
debt repayment.

Upside scenario
While unlikely over the next year, we could raise the rating if the company reduces leverage below 4.5x and
establishes a track record of maintaining it, with capacity for potential acquisitions or dividends. An upgrade would
also be contingent on continuing positive operating and revenue trends.

Assumptions

Key Metrics

• U.S. GDP growth of 2.5% in 2019 and 1.8% in 2020.
We expect core advertising revenue for the radio
industry will lag GDP with annual declines between
1% and 2% due to increasing competition from
alternative media (primarily internet advertising).

• Revenue growth of 1%-3% over the next two years.
We expect iHeartMedia's revenue growth will
outpace the industry primarily due to national
advertising revenue growth of 3%-5% and digital
advertising revenue growth of 18%-20%.

*We include the company's preferred stock ($60
million) and operating lease liability (about $882
million) to our adjusted debt calculation. The company
emerged with a greater lease liability than we
expected, which increased our leverage forecast by
about 0.2x.

• Revenue growth from the company's networks and
live events in the low-single-digit percent area,
largely offset by local advertising revenue declines
relatively in line with the industry.

PF--Pro forma. E—Estimate. N.A.—Not applicable.

• Better revenue growth in 2020 than 2019 because it
is an election year. Katz (the company's media
representation firm) represents television stations,
where political advertising is prevalent.
• Adjusted EBITDA margin improves to 32%-34%
over the next two years from about 31% (pro forma)
in 2018 due to modest cost-saving initiatives and
operating leverage from the company's largely
fixed-cost base.
• Capital expenditures of around $120 million over the
next two years.
• Modest tuck-in acquisitions in 2020 to add technical
capabilities.

Base-case projections
We expect iHeartMedia will outperform the industry.
We expect iHeartMedia's revenue growth will outpace the industry primarily due to national advertising and digital
revenue growth. iHeartMedia garners more revenue from national advertising and digital revenue than its peers due to
its materially larger size.

Healthy FOCF supports deleveraging.
We expect the company will generate more than $200 million in FOCF in 2019 that it will use for voluntary debt
repayment to reduce leverage to 5.4x-5.6x in 2019. We believe that as revenue increases and margins expand FOCF in
2020 will improve to more than $300 million, which it will use for further voluntary debt repayment to reduce leverage
to 4.7x-4.9x.

iHeartMedia Inc.

Company Description
San Antonio-based iHeartMedia is the largest radio company in the U.S. While nearly two-thirds of the company's
revenue comes from broadcast radio, the company also syndicates more than 100 radio programs through its Premiere
network; delivers traffic, weather, and news through its Total Traffic & Weather network; operates digital
music/podcast platform iHeartRadio; runs live music events; and offers audio/media services.
Chart 1

Business Risk: Fair
iHeartMedia has unique digital capabilities.
Given the scale of iHeartRadio (its digital music/podcast platform with 130 million users), iHeartMedia can uniquely
aggregate and analyze user data to provide targeted advertising and measurement analytics. The company also
recently acquired technology that allows advertisers to more easily view and buy inventory, historically difficult in the
larger broadcast industry. Other radio companies have not had the resources to develop these capabilities, which in
our view gives iHeartMedia a competitive advantage and an opportunity to gain market share. We estimate
iHeartMedia generates around 2x the amount of digital revenue than Entercom.

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 6, 2019 5

iHeartMedia Inc.

iHeartMedia has strong brand awareness.
iHeartMedia has unified its various platforms under the iHeartRadio brand. We believe this supports its ability to
cross-promote products across platforms, such as marketing its podcasts and events on broadcast radio. iHeartMedia's
live events are also nationally recognized, such as the iHeartRadio Music Festival and iHeartRadio Jingle Ball.

iHeartMedia faces exposure to secular pressures that affect the radio industry.
We believe advertisers' perception of radio audience value declined over the last several years due to the emergence of
alternative online media (primarily internet advertising), making it difficult for radio broadcasters to increase ad rates
and maintain share of advertising spending. We still expect core advertising revenue will decline for radio
broadcasters, although we believe the low cost of radio spot advertising has made radio a more attractive option
relative to more expensive forms of media. The cost per thousand (CPM) for a radio ad ranges from $5-$10, which is
about one-third the CPM for broadcast television.

Peer comparison
iHeartMedia operates 854 radio stations in 160 markets, while Entercom operates more than 235 radio stations in over
45 markets and Cumulus operates 428 radio stations in 87 markets.
We view iHeartMedia's business much more favorably than Entercom and Cumulus. iHeartMedia's size meaningfully
surpasses Entercom and Cumulus, which in our view makes its platform more attractive to national advertisers looking
for reach. As a result, iHeartMedia has a higher share of radio revenue relative to its audience at 1.5x as compared to
Entercom and Cumulus Media at 1.2x. iHeartMedia also garners more revenue from its digital and events businesses
compared to its peers.
iHeartMedia's large size provides operating cost efficiencies that result in higher adjusted EBITDA margins (around
30% pro forma) compared to Entercom (in the mid-20% area) and Cumulus (in the low-20% area).
We view Sirius XM's business moderately more favorably than iHeartMedia primarily because around 80% of its
revenue comes from relatively stable subscription revenue, which is less volatile than advertising revenue.
Additionally, we believe Sirius XM is less susceptible to displacement from online advertising compared to
iHeartMedia and other terrestrial radio providers. Sirius XM's adjusted EBITDA margin, which declined following its
acquisition of Pandora, is similar to that of iHeartMedia (pro forma) at around 30%.
Note: iHeartMedia's 2018 financial metrics include the operations of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc., which
became a separate entity on May 1, 2019, following iHeartMedia's emergence from bankruptcy. Sirius XM's 2018
financial metrics do not include the operations of Pandora; the acquisition closed on Feb. 1, 2019.

Adjusted ratios

Financial Risk: Highly leveraged
We believe shareholder-friendly activities are likely longer-term.
We believe FOCF will primarily be used toward voluntary debt repayment over the next two years to improve
leverage. Management has publicly said it will prioritize debt reduction until it improves leverage to around 4x, at
which point it will reevaluate its capital allocation priorities. We believe shareholder-friendly activities, including
acquisitions and shareholder returns, are likely longer-term events since iHeartMedia's former creditors own the
majority of the reorganized company's equity.

Liquidity: Strong
We expect iHeartMedia's sources of liquidity will exceed uses by about 5x over the next 12 months and that net
sources would remain positive even with a 30% decline in forecast EBITDA. Given its healthy discretionary cash flow

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 6, 2019 7

iHeartMedia Inc.

and long-dated debt maturities, we believe iHeartMedia could withstand a high-impact, low-probability event without
refinancing. In addition, we believe the company has a solid relationship with its lenders since they own the majority of
the company's equity.
Still, we do not believe the company has a high standing in credit markets given its bankruptcy filing in March 2018
and think that it will need to establish a track record of generally prudent financial risk management following its
recent emergence in May 2019.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• Cash and cash equivalents of about $127 million as
of June 30, 2019.

• Capital expenditures of around $120 million over the
next 12 months.

• Approximately $390 million available under the
company's $450 million asset-based loan (ABL)
facility (net of letters of credit).

• Working capital outflows of around $50 million over
the next 12 months.

• Funds from operations of $600 million to $610
million over the next 12 months.

• Remaining purchase consideration of around $50
million related to the company's acquisitions of Stuff
Media and Jelli in 2018, which will be paid in the
fourth quarter of 2019.

Covenant Analysis
iHeartMedia is subject to a minimum fixed-charge ratio covenant of 1x if it has less than $40 million available under its
ABL facility. While we do not expect this covenant to be active over the next year, we believe the company will have
covenant headroom in excess of 50%.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

We believe that iHeartMedia faces social risks, including cultural and regulatory, related to content as well as data
privacy risk around customer information.
Radio broadcasters are required to operate within the broadcast decency bounds set by the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC), or risk fines or the loss of broadcast licenses.
iHeartMedia is also subject to data privacy risk since its streaming platform (and other technology platforms)
collects consumer data for analytics, attribution and advertising that must be kept confidential. While the company
regularly reviews and implements security measures to protect personal information, any failure or perceived
failure to protect consumer data could have negative implications for iHeartMedia's reputation and profitability.
With no material complaints or fines, iHeartMedia has thus far managed these risks.

Issue Ratings - Recovery Analysis
Key analytical factors
• iHeartCommunications Inc. is the borrower of an unrated $450 million senior secured ABL facility maturing in 2023,
a $3.5 billion senior secured term loan maturing in 2026 ($2.8 billion outstanding), $800 million of 6.375% senior
secured notes due in 2026, $750 million of 5.25% senior secured notes due in 2027, and $1.5 billion of 8.375%
senior unsecured notes due in 2027.
• The senior secured debt is secured by a first-priority lien on substantially all of the company's assets and those of its
guarantors. The ABL facility has a first-priority lien on accounts receivable, qualified cash, and related assets.
• All debt is guaranteed by iHeartCommunications' existing and future material wholly owned subsidiaries and
iHeartMedia Capital I LLC (its direct parent).

Simulated default assumptions
• Our simulated scenario contemplates a default occurring in 2023 primarily due to increased competition from
alternative media and a cyclical downturn in advertising that materially reduce iHeartMedia's revenue and cash flow
given its largely fixed cost base.
• Other default assumptions include a 60% draw on the ABL facility, LIBOR of 2.5%, and all debt includes six months

of prepetition interest.
• We have valued the company on a going-concern basis using a 6x multiple of our projected emergence EBITDA,
which is in line with that of other radio companies we rate.

Simplified waterfall
• EBITDA at emergence: $645 million
• EBITDA multiple: 6x
• Gross recovery value: $3.9 billion
• Net recovery value for waterfall after administrative expenses (5%): $3.7 billion
• Estimated priority claims: $215 million
• Value available for senior secured debt: $3.5 billion
• Estimated senior secured debt claims: $4.4 billion
• --Recovery expectations: 70%-90% (rounded estimate: 75%)
• Value available for senior unsecured debt: $0
• Estimated senior unsecured debt claims: $1.5 billion
• --Recovery expectations: 0%-10% (rounded estimate: 0%)
