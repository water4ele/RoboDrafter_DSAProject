Key Strengths

Key Risks

Good market position due to its high exposure in the
premium vehicle market.

Parent BAG's elevated debt leverage will exert downward rating pressure on BAG
and hence BAIC.

Strong and stable alliance with leading global OEMs.

Further losses expected at the proprietary Beijing brand amid industry downturn
and intense competition.

Timely and sufficient group support in case of need.

High capital spending and net working capital outflow will reduce free operating
cash flows.

A market leader with high exposure to a growing premium-brand market. We expect BAIC Motor Corp. Ltd. (BAIC) to
sustain its leading market position in China's auto market in the next 12-24 months, given its high exposure to the
growing premium market. BAIC's product offerings ranges across mass to premium passenger vehicles. We expect its
premium brand, Beijing Benz, to continue to be the most important profit contributor to BAIC. In our view, Beijing
Benz's attractive product appeal and new model launches will help it to sustain its top-3 position in China's premium
passenger vehicle market. This, together with the continuous growth of the premium market under the backdrop of
Chinese consumption upgrade, underpin BAIC's market position.
Stable alliances with global OEMs to support business growth. We expect BAIC to maintain stable shareholdings in its
joint ventures (JVs) with Daimler AG (Daimler) at 51% and Hyundai Motor Co. (Hyundai) at 50% over the next two to
three years, despite the Chinese government's relaxation on foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto industry. In
our view, the international partners will still have to leverage on BAIC for production facilities, local supply chain
network, financial resources and local government relationships for production localization and market share
expansion in the Chinese auto sector. The proposed US$892 million capital injection in March 2019 into Beijing Benz
without any shareholding changes between BAIC and Daimler supports our view. Moreover, we believe the recent
acquisition of 5% shares in Daimler by its parent, Beijing Automotive Group Co. Ltd. (BAG), in July 2019 will further
strengthen the relationship between BAIC and Daimler. .
BAIC's proprietary brand losses to narrow as company adjust strategy amid downturn in China's auto market.Chinese
passenger vehicle sales volume dropped by 14% year-over-year (yoy) in the first half of 2019, after a 2.7% decline in
full-year 2018. The emergence of other Chinese local brands with attractive pricing and product offerings is
exacerbating general market competition. We anticipate BAIC's proprietary brands will remain loss-making on weak

sales. However, the losses will narrow over the next 12-24 months as the company invests in research & development
(R&D) for technology upgrades and at the same time to dispose some non-performing brands.
Lower free operating cash flows driven by high capital expenditure and working capital outflow. While we forecast
BAIC's free operating cash flow (FOCF) will remain positive, we see less buffer due to increasing capital spending and
net working capital outflow. We expect Beijing Benz to continue to expand capacity to capture growing demand in the
premium market. We also anticipate BAIC will work on technology upgrades and enhancement for its proprietary
brand. Meanwhile, the net working capital outflow is likely negative during 2019-2020, driven by slower turnover of
receivables and inventory amid generally challenging conditions across the industry value chain.
BAIC to remain a core subsidiary of BAG and its rating is equalized to the parent rating The rating on BAIC reflects
our expectation that the company will remain a core subsidiary of BAG. We believe BAIC will receive timely and
sufficient support from BAG in case of need. We therefore equalize the rating on the company with the rating on BAG.
In our view, BAG's elevated leverage to exert downward rating pressure on BAG and hence BAIC. We estimate the
additional debt arising from its 5% stake in Daimler AG will more than offset improving profit and working capital
management, making BAG's ratio of funds from operations (FFO) to debt approach our downgrade threshold of 20% in
2019-2020.

Outlook: Negative

The negative outlooks on BAG and BAIC reflect our expectation that BAG's financial leverage is unlikely to
improve substantially over the next 24 months due to the company's recent acquisition of Daimler's shares. This is
despite our forecast of BAG's increasing profit and better working capital management following a robust
performance by the Beijing Benz JV and faster collection of new energy vehicle (NEV) subsidies.

Downside scenario
We may lower the ratings on BAG and BAIC if BAG's FFO-to-debt ratio fails to revert to above 20% over a
sustained period. This could happen due to a significant deterioration in profitability owing to a prolonged industry
downturn or weaker working capital management than we expect.
We may also lower the ratings if BAG's competitive position weakens as reflected by a material decline in sales
volume and profitability for an extended period.
We could also downgrade the companies if we believe the likelihood of extraordinary support from the Beijing
government could weaken, or if BAIC loses a controlling stake in Beijing Benz.
In addition, we could downgrade BAIC if BAIC's importance to BAG weakens.

Upside scenario
We may revise the outlooks on BAG and BAIC to stable if BAG's FFO-to-debt ratio reverts to above 20%
sustainably. This could happen if BAG's stake in Daimler is partly funded by equity or the company's financial
performance beats our expectation, likely due to better working capital management or stronger-than-expected
industry recovery.

Base-case projections
BAIC's revenue supported by premium market growth. We expect BAIC's revenues to continue to expand by 10%-15%
annually, supported by the robust growth of Beijing Benz. This is despite the industry downturn, which saw Chinese
passenger vehicles slump 14% yoy in sales volume in the first half of 2019.
EBITDA margin to decline to 15%-17% in 2019-2020 from 18.3% in 2018. The decrease is mainly attributable to the
delivery of A-class Beijing Benz models which have a relatively lower gross margin and require higher selling expenses
for the model rollout. This is partially mitigated by the company's disposal of loss-making proprietary brands and
transfer of their excess production capacity to Beijing Benz.
Dividend from Beijing Hyundai to remain limited. We account for Beijing Hyundai under the equity method (same as
reported) and assume it will continue to proportionally pay out all of its free operating cash flow to BAG and Hyundai.
Beijing Hyundai's sales volume remained flat in 2018 after a 31% yoy decline in 2017. We anticipate that Beijing
Hyundai will continue to focus on product upgrades and enhancing capacity utilization to improve its overall
competitiveness and financial management. We expect dividend income from Beijing Hyundai to be minimal in 2019
and RMB200 million-RMB500 million in 2020.

Company Description
Headquartered in Beijing, BAIC mainly engages in the research and development, manufacturing, and sales of
automobiles in China. The company was listed on Hong Kong stock exchange in December 2014. BAIC is 43% owned
by Beijing government via BAG (BBB+/Stable/--).
BAIC is the major operating subsidiary of BAG and it holds core assets of the latter. The company accounted for
around 60% of BAG's revenue and 90% of BAG's EBITDA in 2018.

Business Risk: Fair
We expect BAIC to maintain its top-3 position in China's premium-auto market. BAIC has a wide product portfolio
ranging from premium to mass-market passenger vehicles. We believe this makes the company more competitive than
most the majority of its domestic peers, which are solely exposed to the mass market. Despite a 4.1% yoy decline in
the overall Chinese passenger vehicles' sales volume in 2018, BAIC's sales volume decreased a marginal 0.4%. This
was mainly attributable to the robust performance of Beijing Benz, which saw 15% volume growth.
Beijing Benz should continue to be the major profit contributor to BAIC given the sustainable growth in China's
premium auto market. In our view, the domestic premium market will continue to grow over the next one to two
years, amid an upgrade trend by Chinese consumers. We anticipate Beijing Benz will maintain its top-three position in
the premium market, owing to its ongoing launch of new models and production ramp-up. By our estimates, Beijing
Benz will continue to contribute over 90%-100% of BAIC's gross profit over the next 12-24 months.
On the other hand, BAIC's proprietary passenger vehicles will likely face intensified competition against the backdrop
of declining demand in the mass market. The sales volume of the company's proprietary brand, Beijing brand, declined
by 34% in 2018, after a 48% drop in 2017. We believe the Beijing brand will continue to see lower margins compared
with the global industry average. This is mainly driven the segment's limited technology assistance from leading global

SEPTEMBER 10, 2019 6

BAIC Motor Corp. Ltd.

original equipment manufacturers (OEMS), less-appealing product offerings, limited market recognition, and low
capacity utilization. We believe that the Beijing brand is likely to continue to incur gross profit losses. However, the
losses are likely to narrow with the company working on product upgrades and disposing of nonperforming brands.

Peer comparison
We consider Beijing Automotive Group Co. Ltd. (BAG), Dongfeng Motor Group Co. Ltd. (Dongfeng), Geely
Automobile Holdings Ltd. (Geely), Hyundai Motor Co. (Hyundai)and Daimler AG (Daimer) as BAIC's closest peers as
they are all auto OEMs.
BAIC's business scale is comparable to most domestic peers, but smaller than that of the international peers. The
company has product offerings in both the premium and mass markets, but with a focus in the premium market which
accounts for around 90% of its revenue. As such, BAIC enjoys relatively higher EBITDA margin as compared to
Dongfeng and Geely, which only focus in mass market.
Both BAIC and Dongfeng are core subsidiaries of their state-owned enterprise (SOE) parents, and are likely to receive
indirect extraordinary government support from the Beijing municipal government and Chinese central government
respectively in case of need. Geely, Hyundai Motor, and Daimler are private companies that don't benefit from
extraordinary government support.

Financial Risk: Modest
We believe BAIC will maintain its net cash position in 2019 and 2020 despite the challenging market conditions.
We expect BAIC to generate strong operating cash flow during the period, mainly supported by the robust
performance of Beijing Benz. In our view, consumer upgrades will solidify the standing of Beijing Benz in the premium
vehicle segment. At the same time, both the Beijing brand and Beijing Hyundai are undertaking measures to improve
their profitability. These include enhancing their product appeal, increase and production efficiency, as well as the
disposal of non-performing brands, e.g. Wevan.
BAIC's free operating cash flows will continue to remain positive 2019-2020, but to decline as compared to 2018, due
to working capital changes and high capital spending. We forecast the company will see annual net working capital
outflow of RMB2.0 billion-RMB6.0 billion during the period, due to longer turnover days for accounts receivable and
inventory in face of the challenging conditions. At the same time, we expect the company to incur high capital
expenditure to fund production capacity expansion in Beijing Benz. While the mass market demand has been
shrinking, we expect Beijing Benz to continue to expand capacity to capture growing demand. The JV is currently
running at over 100% utilization. We also anticipate BAIC will work on technology upgrades for the Beijing brand,
including for the NEV product line. As such, we forecast the company's annual capital expenditure to be RMB10
billion-RMB12 billion, compared with RMB7.0 billion in 2018.

Liquidity: Strong
We assess BAIC's liquidity as strong. We believe liquidity sources will exceed uses by over 1.5x for the 12 months from
March 2019, and remain above 1.0x over the subsequent 12-month period. Liquidity sources should exceed uses even
if EBITDA falls 30% from our base-case forecast.
We believe BAIC's abundant cash on hand provides the company a cushion against potential industry adversity with
limited need for refinancing. In addition, we expect BAIC to maintain its sound relationship with Chinese state-owned
banks and satisfactory standing in credit markets, which help in securing funding at low costs. BAIC has no restrictive
financial covenants.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

Environmental factors are relevant for our analysis of BAIC, given that auto producers are facing increasing
regulations in China in terms of carbon dioxide emissions, which in turn may affect their competitiveness and
profit.
NEVs accounted for 3% of BAIC's total sales volume in 2018 and the percentage is likely to moderately increase in
the next one to two years. BAIC mainly rolls out NEV models through its proprietary Beijing brand and the
company is China's No.8 NEV producer by the number of NEV credits in 2018. The Chinese government requires
auto OEMs to accumulate a certain number of NEV credits to avoid potential punishment such as temporary
suspension for the manufacture of high fuel-consumption vehicles. We believe BAIC will invest substantially to
advance NEV technology in the coming two years. At the same time, the company is in the process of launching
the EQC model, the first NEV model of Daimler, at Beijing Benz. As such, we anticipate BAIC will increase its 2019
and 2020 capital expenditure and R&D spending by around 30%-50% yoy. However, this is likely to have only
limited impact on the company's financial metrics.
Social factors do not play a material role in our assessment for BAIC, but product liability issues are inherent risks
for all auto producers. So far, we have not observed any material recalls or lawsuits concerning the above.

Group Influence
We view BAIC to be a core subsidiary of BAG. We believe BAIC will receive timely and sufficient support from BAG in
case of need. As such, we equalize BAIC's rating to our rating on BAG.
We anticipate BAG will remain the sole controlling shareholder of BAIC. BAG also directly appointed majority of
senior management to the company for strategic alignment. In our view, BAIC is highly integrated with the group in
terms of strategy and operations in the development of passenger vehicles in both mass and premium markets. BAG
mainly conducts business via BAIC, which holds the key assets of BAG, including the joint ventures of BAG with
Daimler AG and Hyundai Motor Co. as well as the proprietary brands. We expect BAIC to continue to contribute to
more than 90% of BAG's EBITDA.
BAG's elevated financial leverage will likely exert downward rating pressure on BAG and hence BAIC. We expect
BAG's profit to increase on robust performance of Beijing Benz and its working capital management should also
improve on faster collection of NEV subsidies. However, these strengths will be insufficient to offset the impact of the
additional debt incurred in the recent purchase of Daimer shares.

Government Influence
We see BAG as having a very high likelihood of receiving extraordinary support from the municipal government of

BAIC Motor Corp. Ltd.

Beijing in the event of distress, based on the following factors:
• Very important role to the Beijing government: BAG contributes more than 80% of the industrial production of
Beijing's automotive industry, which is considered a high-end pillar industry for the city. BAG is one of the largest
profit and tax contributors, and creates a large employment pool for the city. We believe a default or credit stress at
BAG would disrupt its operations, and would have a materially negative social and economic impact.
• Very strong link with the Beijing government: The government owns 100% of BAG, and we believe it intends to
maintain absolute majority control on the company over the next two years at least. We believe the government
exerts a strong influence on the company's strategy through the appointment of the board and senior management.
Meanwhile, the government has a track record of providing continuous support to BAG in the past years, through
capital injections and cash subsidies, to support various R&D initiatives.
