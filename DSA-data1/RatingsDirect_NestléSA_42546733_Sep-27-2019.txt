Key Risks

Leading global market positions, diversified product portfolio supported
by well-known brands

Likely mergers and acquisition (M&A) activity and high shareholder
remuneration, meaning adjusted debt leverage should remain near
1.8x

Accelerated portfolio rotation toward higher-growth categories like pet
care, coffee, and infant nutrition

High price pressure from competitors and retailers, especially in
Western Europe

Extensive manufacturing and distribution footprint; large research and
development (R&D) and marketing means

Water division (8% of revenues) having lower growth and profitability
than other businesses

Very large and stable free operating cash flow (FOCF) base of 11
billion-12 billion Swiss francs (CHF), with stable capital expenditures
(capex)
Acquisition policy focused on small-to-midsize deals

Active portfolio reshaping and operating cost cuts support earnings growth.S&P Global Ratings believes that Nestlé
S.A.'s strategy to focus on categories like pet care, coffee, or infant nutrition, water, and health science, which have
growth prospects of 4%-5% annually is credit supportive. We think Nestlé, thanks to its well-known brands, large
marketing, and R&D means, and its established global leading positions should benefit from the growth potential in
emerging markets, notably Asia. We also view positively the efforts to make the operating cost base leaner as the
group moves to a more digital production and distribution asset base. Still, we believe it could make sense to
strengthen the product offering in plant-based food and beverages, which fits with health and wellness credentials.
Asset disposals are not really affecting the business' high diversity. Nestlé has a uniquely diversified product portfolio
within the food and beverages industry. We think the group's strong ambitions in categories such as pet care, infant
nutrition, and coffee means that it has to make choices on capital allocation. Therefore, to dispose of businesses like
skin health seems prudent because Nestlé doesn't appear to us as having a clear competitive advantage in this
category. The sale of these assets are also not material enough in terms of cash flow to really affect the business'
diversity.
Financial policy is slightly less conservative than before, but adjusted debt leverage should remain in check.Since 2017
and its most recent strategic plan, Nestlé decided to releverage its capital structure to reach an adjusted debt leverage
ratio of 1.8x in 2018 (1.6x reported) by increasing significantly shareholder remuneration. We understand that the

Nestlé S.A.

management has no rating or debt leverage target but that, absent large transformational M&A deal, we think leverage
is not likely to rise above 2x because the group is keen to keep low financing costs. We believe that share buybacks
will continue, notably with asset disposals. However, should there be a large M&A, we believe that the L'Oreal stake
could be monetized or some assets could be disposed.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our view that Nestlé will maintain its leading global market positions in key categories,
execute well its portfolio reshaping toward higher-growth categories and emerging markets, and implementing its
cost savings program. We believe that the strong portfolio of brands and innovation capabilities will enable the
group to offset potential volatile commodity costs and high price pressure from competitors and retailers.
To maintain the rating, we see Nestlé maintaining adjusted debt to EBITDA at about 2x, considering the very
strong free cash flow generation, upcoming large cash proceeds from disposals (such as skin health and Herta), and
focus on small-to-midsize acquisitions while calibrating shareholder remuneration, which has increased since 2017.

Downside scenario
We could lower the rating if adjusted debt leverage rises to above 2x permanently. This could occur, for example, if
Nestlé was to enter a large debt-financed acquisition without monetizing its multibillion stake in L'Oreal. We would
also view negatively a continued large share buyback program beyond 2019 from internal cash flow, which would
pressure credit metrics. We could also consider a downgrade if the group loses its leading global market position in
a key category like pet care, coffee, or infant nutrition due to intense competitive pressures or lack of innovation.
This could translate into organic revenue decline and operating margin pressure.

Upside scenario
Rating upside would be contingent on Nestlé's management demonstrating a strong public commitment to
returning to a more conservative financial policy. This would translate into adjusted debt leverage declining to and
staying at 1.5x. However, considering management recent comments on debt leverage tolerance toward a
potential transformational acquisition, we believe this is very unlikely to happen during the two-year outlook
horizon.

• An adjusted EBITDA margin of 21%-22.0%, driven
mostly by the growth in emerging markets and
higher margin businesses like pet care and
powdered and liquid beverages, as well as cost
savings (offset to some extent by restructuring
costs).
• FOCF of CHF11 billion-CHF12 billion, assuming
annual capex of 4.5%-5.0% of sales
• Our adjusted debt of CHF31 billion-35 billion, which
also includes CHF3.2 billion of net pension deficit.
We assume cash dividends of CHF 7.3
billion-CHF7.5 billion annually and CHF2.0 billion of
acquisitions annually. We net out debt with cash
balances and liquid financial assets, but evaluate
restricted cash at about CHF515 million

Base-Case Projections
The growth in emerging markets and cost cuts support improving profitability in 2019-2020.We forecast that
profitability should continue to rise by 100 basis points over the next two years. This is due to the growth in emerging
markets, which are more profitable for Nestlé, portfolio reshaping toward highly profitable categories, and operating
costs cuts with Nestlé on track in its CHF2.0 billion-CHF2.5 billion savings program.
Adjusted debt leverage should remain below 2.0x in 2019 and 2020 despite large share buybacks.Nestlé's adjusted debt
leverage was 2.2x at June 2019. However, the business' seasonality and the payment of a CHF7.2 billion annual
dividend affected first-half credit metrics. For 2019, expected cash proceeds from the disposal of the skin health
business should help improve debt leverage decrease to below 2.0x despite the completion of the CHF20 billion share
buyback program. For 2020, we think likely that Nestlé will undertake more share buybacks from the disposal of skin
health absent a significant M&A deal. Still, we believe the combination of a higher EBITDA base and a focus on
maintaining low financing costs is likely to mean adjusted debt leverage will remain below 2x.
The free operating cash flow base will remain very large despite planned disposals and higher financing costs.Free
operating cash flow are forecast to grow moderately to CHF11 billion-CHF12 billion annually, thanks to EBITDA
growth lifted by improved performance in North America, positive growth prospects in most categories, and operating
cost cuts offsetting loss of earnings from asset disposals. Positive working capital movements and stable capex
spending should offset higher interest expenses arising from increased debt.

Company Description
Nestlé, based in Switzerland, is the world's largest food and beverages group, founded more than 150 years ago. In
2018 Revenues amounted to CHF91.4 billion with S&P Global Ratings-adjusted EBITDA of CHF18.9 billion.
Nestlé is a listed company, with most shares being free float on the Zurich Stock Exchange.
The group operates in 190 countries, with most sales generated in mature markets (58% sales, compared with 42% for
emerging markets). However, emerging markets grew 3x faster than mature markets in 2018 and have higher
underlying profitability.
The group has diverse businesses, mostly within food and beverages:
• Powdered and liquid beverages (CHF21.6 billion of revenues, underlying operating margin of 22.7%). Main products
are coffee beverages like Nescafé, Nespresso, or Starbucks. Nestlé has a perpetual license to sell Starbucks
consumer packaged products and foodservice globally. This excludes ready-to-drink products and sales within
coffee shops). Other beverages include cocoa-malt beverage Milo and Nesquik;
• Nutrition and health science (CHF16.2 billion; 20.6%). Main products are infant formula and baby food (illuma,
Gerber, and Nan), as well as health food like Garden of Life (Atrium);
• Milk products and ice cream (CHF13.2 billion; 19.1%). Main products are ambient milk products like Nido, Coffee
Mate and ice-creams like Haagen-Dazs;
• Petcare (CHF12.8 billion; 21.6%). Main products are Pet food products under the Purina brand;
• Prepared dishes and cooking aids (CHF12.1 billion, underlying operating margin of 18%). Main products are
bouillons, soups, ambient and chilled food products, frozen foods, and pizzas. Main brands are Maggi, Stouffer's, and
Herta;
• Confectionary (CHF8.1 billion; 17.3%). Main products are chocolate bars like KitKat, sweets like Quality streets, and
Hsu Fu Chi; and
• Water (CHF7.4 billion; 10.5%). Main products are bottled waters: Perrier, San Pellegrino and Nestlé Pure Life.

Business Risk: Excellent
Nestlé is one of the largest branded food and beverages group globally, with revenues of CHF91 billion in 2018 (about
€80 billion). It has leading market positions worldwide in a wide number of categories, most of which have growth
prospects of 3%-7% and bear low cyclicality. The overall business is well balanced geographically, with emerging
markets accounting for 42% of revenues but for the majority of group earnings.
The business strategy is to continue reshaping the product portfolio (CH15 billion of assets acquired and sold over the
past two years) toward the higher-growth categories in food and beverages and nutritional health products: coffee, pet
care, infant nutrition, water, and consumer health, which combined already account for 61% of operating profit. We
believe most of the volume growth potential for midprice-range products lies in emerging markets, while there is scope
to expand the range of high-end products both in mature and emerging markets. We believe the large portfolio of
well-known brands (34 billionaire brands) and strong innovation capabilities (1,500 new products launched in 2018;
CHF1.7 billion annual budget) enables the group to benefit from strong pricing power in most categories.
In terms of expansion strategy, we believe that Nestlé will focus on investing in coffee, pet care, infant nutrition and

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 26, 2019 8

Nestlé S.A.

health nutrition. For example, it has expanded further in coffee with the $7.15 billion acquisition of the Starbucks
perpetual license for consumption at home and in foodservice (a $2 billion business). This complements well its own
brands Nespresso and Nescafé in a segment that is fast-growing, notably in Asia. Atrium Innovations, acquired in 2017
for $2.3 billion, has enabled the group to increase the range of health nutrition products. We also see strong growth
potential for the pet care business in Asia.
Important disposals have occurred as part of the portfolio reshaping, because these categories have weak growth
prospects or they do not fit with the business model. For example, the skin health division, which accounted for 3% of
revenues in 2018 (including the skin care brand Galderma) and for which we expect a sale by the end of 2019 for
CHF10.2 billion, did not fit with the business focus in health nutrition. Nestlé also exited the U.S confectionary market,
is selling part of its prepared dish business (Herta charcuterie in Europe), and sold its Gerber Life Insurance business
for $1.55 billion.
Business challenges include the high price pressure from retailers and competitors in mature markets, especially
Western Europe. Nevertheless, North America returned to growth since 2018 thanks notably to the improvement at
Purina as well as the growth of Starbucks. Consumer demand in China, notably in infant nutrition due to lower birth
levels, seems to be decelerating. Also, Nestlé has a limited presence in India, a very large and growing consumer
market that is actually quite small for the group (1.6% of revenues in 2018).
We see medium-term threats arising from intensifying level of competition. In retail coffee, Nestlé is facing Keurig Dr
Pepper (BBB/Stable/A-2) in the U.S. and Jacobs Dow Egberts (BB/Positive/--), both owned by JAB Holding
Company Sarl (A-/Stable/--) while The Coca-Cola Company (A+/Stable/A-1) is expanding in the category with the
recent £3.9 billion acquisition of Costa Coffee. In infant nutrition, notably in China (the world's largest market), Nestlé
is No. 1 but is seeing intense competition from Danone (BBB+/Stable/A-2), Reckitt Benckiser Group plc
(A-/Stable/A-2), Abbott, and local players. In pet food, Nestlé is No. 2, with about a 21% market share (source:
Euromonitor), slightly behind consumer giant Mars (24%) but is now facing new players like Blue Buffalo in the U.S.,
bought for $8 billion by General Mills (BBB/Stable/A-2).
Five of the group's 34 billionaire brands appear to have relatively weak growth prospects including Stoffer's (frozen
food) and Nestlé Pure Life (water). Water had the lowest margin among all businesses with 11.4% in first-half 2019
(compared with 17.1% for the group) and is increasing below the group average (2.0% compared with 3.6% for the
group). The division seems to have price positioning issues on its core product offering, especially in the U.S. We also
think the product range lacks a wide offering in plant-based foods with the U.S. frozen food line (Stouffer's) needed to
be refreshed, although pizza is growing well.
Digitalization of production and supply-chain require investments but improved efficiency has helped reduce working
capital intensity: 1.4% of sales in 2018 (down from 5.3% in 2014). We also note that e-commerce has grown 18% in
2018 with notably strong growth in U.S. and China and now accounts for 7.4% of total sales.
The group benefits from very large manufacturing and distribution capacities in all regions of the world, which enables
economies of scale. Still, to meet its 2020 profitability target of underlying trading operating profit margin of
17.5%-18.5% (Nestlé was at 17.0% in 2018), it is progressing well on its CHF2.0 billion-CHF2.5 billion cost savings

Nestlé S.A.

program focusing on cutting fixed operating costs: fewer production sites, reduced overhead, and lower distribution
costs. For example, the direct frozen distribution business in the U.S. will change to a less costly warehouse model. We
understand the cost savings achieved are then mostly reinvested in marketing and R&D, which should enable Nestlé to
respond to rising competition intensity and support its expansion in complex markets like China.
Profitability has been improving for several years, with EBITDA margin (S&P Global Ratings-adjusted) rising from
19.2% in 2014 to our forecast of about 21% for 2019. However, issues can arise from the volatility of raw materials
(energy, agriculture commodities, packaging) while restructuring costs (CHF700 million estimated for 2019) are likely
to remain for a few years.

The selected peers are all large nondurable consumer goods companies with global operations.
Nestlé has the largest revenue base compared with peers with Danone being notably 3x smaller. Nestlé benefits from
the largest number of billionaire brands (34) followed by Pepsico (22) and P&G (20). Procter & Gamble (P&G) and
Nestlé have a similar EBITDA and FOCF base, well above other peers. That said P&G has better operating margins
thanks to its business being mostly personal care compared with food and beverages for Nestlé.
In terms of business diversity, we believe Nestlé is the best positioned among peers being in several, large and growing
categories with low exposure to declining segments of food and beverages. Nevertheless, we value Unilever, which
evolves both in personal care and the highly profitable food and beverages segments like sauces and dressings; and
P&G, which is in five categories like home care, personal care, and beauty. Pepsico, meanwhile, operates a
large-but-lower-growth soft drinks business, which offsets good growth prospects in snacks.
Nestlé appears better diversified geographically than P&G and Pepsico, which still have a large single-market exposure
to the U.S. However, Unilever has a bigger presence in emerging markets (about 60% of sales) compared with Nestlé
(42%), being notably larger in India.
Nestle has lower adjusted debt leverage compared than most peers and is on par with P&G at 1.6-1.8x. Danone is still
deleveraging, at about 3x currently, following its large debt-financed acquisition of WhiteWave in 2016. Most
companies, except for Danone, have negative discretionary cash flows due to large dividend and share buybacks
payments. However, Nestlé, like most peers, tend to follow a prudent acquisition policy with a focus on midsize deals.

Financial Risk: Modest
Nestlé generates very large, stable free operating cash flow base forecast at CHF11 billion-CHF12 billion annually,
thanks to its very large scale, diversity of businesses, and established global market positions. We believe the portfolio
reshaping toward higher-growth and profitable categories should help grow cash flows.
This should help offset the loss of earnings from business disposals such as skin health and higher interest expenses
due to increased debt, which is largely denominated in U.S. dollars. Also, Nestlé has substantially reduced working
capital intensity and capex spending over the past years. Still, we think unlikely that capex (now 4% of revenues) can
fall much further.
While free cash flow generation should remain strong, we expect adjusted debt levels will continue rising gradually to
CHF35 billion-CHF37 billion (vs. CHF34 billion in 2018) in the next two years due to moderate dividend increase,
share buybacks from proceeds of asset disposals, and some acquisitions.
In recent years, Nestlé's credit metrics have slightly weakened due to the decisions to increase share buybacks.
Adjusted debt leverage was 1.2-1.4x from 2014-2017 and rose to 1.8x in 2018 following about CHF14 billion of cash
paid to shareholders. For 2019-2020, we forecast adjusted debt leverage to remain near 1.8x as we think Nestlé will
calibrate its debt leverage while continuing to return cash to shareholders from asset disposals like skin health after its
CHF20 billion program expires this year.

Nestlé S.A.

Acquisitions are likely to remain a central part of the strategy because we believe Nestlé wants to accelerate its global
reach in the high growth categories. We also think that the group is unlikely to seek large transformational deals due to
the high multiples in these categories. Rather, Nestlé will more likely focus on midsize deals to do some additions to its
brand portfolio or move to a new niche, but promising, segment.
Despite this, multibillion deals the size of Atrium Innovations or Starbucks could occur again. In May 2019 at its
investor day, Mr. François-Xavier Roger, Nestlé's CFO, commented that the group would be comfortable to have a
floor rating not lower than mid 'A' for a transformational acquisition. This highlights to us that the group wants
flexibility for potential acquisitions but we believe Nestlé would probably monetize its stake in L'Oreal (worth €32
billion, or CHF29.5 billion, on Sept. 10, 2019) to keep debt leverage in check and continue benefit from very low
financing costs. Nevertheless, given the strong share price appreciation and related dividend payments from L'Oreal, it
is understandable that Nestlé is no rush to dispose of its stake.

Liquidity: Adequate
The short-term rating is 'A-1+'. We view the liquidity position as adequate, with sources covering uses by more than
1.2x over the next six months. The amount of short-term commercial paper has significantly increased over the past
months. However, Nestlé is highly free cash flow generative and we believe it will retain easy access to long-term
capital markets and a large pool of banks. It also holds a large stake in L'Oreal, worth €32 billion, or CHF29.5 billion,
as of Sept. 10, 2019 which it could use to raise cash quickly if needed. We have not factored the CHF10.2 billion
disposal of skin health into our calculations because the group has not yet decided on the allocation of the proceeds.
Principal Liquidity Sources

Principal Liquidity Uses

• CHF5.0 billion of cash balances and short-term
investments as of June 30, 2019

• About CHF19 billion of debt within one year with a
large majority being commercial paper

• €4.5 billion equivalent of undrawn committed
revolving credit facility maturing in more than one
year

• Estimated maintenance capex of CHF3.0 billion
annually

• €6.5 billion equivalent undrawn committed
revolving credit facility maturing in November 2019
that has a one-year extension at Nestlé's control

• Projected cash dividends CHF7.5 billion of 2020
• Projected CHF2 billion of share buybacks in 2019
under the current program

• Projected CHF15 billion-CHF16 billion of cash funds
from operations in the coming 12 months

Debt maturitiesat June 30, 2019
• 2019: About CHF16 billion, with a large majority being commercial paper
• 2020: CHF3.25 billion
• 2021: CHF4.125 billion
• 2022: CHF3.0 billion
• 2023 and beyond: CHF16.6 billion

Issue Ratings--Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
Most of the long-term debt instruments are issued by either by top holding company Nestlé SA, intermediary holdings
companies like Nestlé Holdings Inc., or group financing vehicles like Nestlé Finance International.

Analytical conclusions
We rate the Nestlé group's long-term senior unsecured debt 'AA-', in line with the issuer credit rating. This is because
there is limited structural subordination as total secured debt and debt held at operating companies are well below the
50% criteria threshold.

Other Credit Considerations
The rating is one notch lower than our 'aa' anchor score to reflect our view that the increase in share buybacks
payments since 2017 translates into adjusted debt leverage standing at the upper end of 1.5x-2.0x range.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

Nestlé has moderate exposure to environmental, social, and governance factors like plastic packaging waste, water
scarcity, and food safety. Food safety issues can have an immediate, high-impact on a particular brand and
regional market.
Demand for a product or brand could drop sharply if consumers no longer trust product quality, while traceability
is becoming an increasingly important factor in consumer purchases. In April 2015, a government laboratory in
India said it had detected lead levels above permissible limits, as well as MSG, in a sample of Nestlé's Maggi
noodles. Nestlé India and other independent accredited laboratories subsequently performed several tests showing
the product was safe. Given growing consumer confusion, Nestlé India temporarily stopped selling Maggi noodles
in June 2015 until the situation was resolved. In November 2015, Maggi noodles returned to shelves, and Nestlé
avoided long-term reputational damage.
For packaging waste, governments could enforce more stringent recycling rules, which would mean higher
operating costs if Nestlé has to pay to collect and recycle waste. To tackle this, Nestlé committed to make 100% of
its plastic packaging recyclable or reusable by 2025. It also plans to eliminate nonrecyclable plastics. Nestlé uses
large quantities of water to bottle beverages and water. Given greater water scarcity in many regions, the group
could have higher operating costs to source water.
We view Nestlé's management and governance as strong, reflecting management's ability to grow profitably and
the board's balanced composition. Gender diversity is also a focus for the group; women hold about 43% of
management roles. The company aims for women to hold 30% of the top 200 senior management roles by 2022,
versus 20% currently.
