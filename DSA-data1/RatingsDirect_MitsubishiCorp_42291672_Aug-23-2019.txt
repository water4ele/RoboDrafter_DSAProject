Overview
Key strengths

Key risks

Stable profit generation, backed by a highly diversified business portfolio and
the largest business foundation in its industry

Profits and cash flow to remain prone to market volatility, given
risk exposures to resource-related sectors remains sizable

Excellent decision-making on investments and divestments in resources and
energy, effective investment portfolio management, and a strong record of
building global networks and gathering information

Likely continuation of substantial spending for growth and
shareholder returns, and a possibility of additional financial
burdens if the performance of Chiyoda Corp. deteriorates again

Conservative financial discipline, through which the company has balanced
operating cash flow and new investments
Adjusted capital (risk buffer), is likely to exceed the risk-based
capital(risk-weighted assets) required under our 'A' stress scenario

Based on the well-diversified, strong business portfolio, Mitsubishi Corp. will likely continue to generate strong profits.
S&P Global Ratings expects net profits of Japan-based general trading and investment company (GTIC) Mitsubishi
Corp. to steadily increase in the next one or two years. They stood at around ¥600 billion in fiscal 2018. We expect the
increase to be driven by steady profit contributions, mainly from nonresource businesses including food and other
living essentials, automotive, and infrastructure. Mitsubishi Corp. has continuously strengthened its business portfolio,
mainly in nonresource sectors. Thus, we believe the company has become less susceptible to external factors and
resource prices. Some of the company's businesses, including convenience store Lawson Inc., face increasingly harsh
competition. Mitsubishi Corp. is likely to continue to experience difficulties in identifying new investment opportunities
that will lead to long-term profit contributions. However, we believe the company can achieve strong and stable profits
by further enhancing its competitiveness in strong, strategic business areas and replacing assets in the business
portfolio in a timely manner. We think its strategic business areas include retail, logistics and renewable energy.

Mitsubishi Corp.'s financial burdens are likely to remain manageable, although its financial capacity may weaken
relative to its current rating. Improvements in Mitsubishi Corp.'s capital adequacy against risk-weighted assets, an
important consideration in our credit analysis, is likely to slow down. This is because of higher spending for growth
and shareholder returns. In fiscal 2019, we expect the company's free cash flow to decline year on year. We expect it
to end in negative territory after distributions to shareholders, including share buybacks of up to ¥300 billion. We also
expect Mitsubishi Corp.'s investments, compared to fiscal 2018, to increase further in the next one to two years.
However, we think Mitsubishi Corp. will remain able to manage its financial burdens in the next one to two years for
two main reasons. First, we expect the company to continue generating solid operating cash flow, backed by a strong
business performance, while at the same time generating cash by switching businesses. Second, we think the company
will remain disciplined and maintain sound financial measures, such as capital adequacy, when determining
shareholder returns.
Mitsubishi Corp.'s strategy of increasing earnings by raising its enterprise value will be tested with its management of
the turnaround of underperforming portfolio company Chiyoda Corp.Mitsubishi Corp. may suffer additional financial
burdens if Chiyoda Corp.'s performance deteriorates again. The GTIC has announced it will provide ¥160 billion in
financial support to its equity-method affiliate, which posted a net loss in fiscal 2018 because of worsening profitability
at an overseas plant. Mitsubishi Corp. plans to make it a consolidated subsidiary. We consider the result of Chiyoda's
turnaround plan to be one of the key elements in our credit assessment. Mitsubishi Corp. operates businesses in
various sectors, providing business support and sending managers to the companies it invests in, as well as to group
companies. We therefore believe the company's investment portfolio has become more complex. Mitsubishi Corp.
aims to increase profitability and manage its portfolio appropriately. In our view, it has therefore become more
important that the company further strengthens its strategic business areas, enhances its asset selection, and optimizes
replacement timing for the assets in its portfolio.

Outlook: Stable

The stable outlook reflects our view that the company's capital adequacy will steadily improve in the next year or
two. We base this view on our expectation that despite more spending, the company will accumulate shareholders'
equity through the steady retention of net profits and uphold a conservative investment policy. The outlook also
reflects our expectation that Mitsubishi Corp. will achieve a steady return on risk-weighted assets (RORA) of
around 15%.

Upside scenario
We will consider an upgrade if profits and profitability from resource and nonresource businesses continue to
grow, steadily pushing Mitsubishi Corp.'s RORA beyond 20%. Additionally, we may upgrade the company if its net
profit and shareholders' equity improve faster than we assume and we determine that its adjusted capital will
improve and significantly surpass the level required for risk-based capital under our 'A' stress scenario.

Downside scenario
We would consider lowering Mitsubishi Corp.'s ratings if its net profit falls far short of ¥400 billion in fiscal 2019.
This could happen if, for example, there are impairment losses in the resource segment because of a drop in
commodity prices, or if Chiyoda Corp.'s performance worsens. We would also consider a downgrade if the
company again becomes excessively aggressive on investments and shareholder returns. Such circumstances
could lead us to see a heightened likelihood of its free cash flow turning significantly negative, to the point that
adjusted capital falls below the required risk-based capital under our 'A' stress scenario and stays there.

Base-case projections
Mitsubishi Corp.'s overall net profit will increase moderately, driven by steady improvement in nonresource
businesses. Despite growing uncertainties on the external environment and resource prices, the company's net
profit is likely to grow steadily and exceed ¥600 billion from fiscal 2019 onward. Company efforts to strengthen the
competitiveness of existing businesses, such as retail, logistics and automotive, and the divesture of assets in a
timely manner will facilitate this improvement.
Despite larger investments and returns to shareholders, Mitsubishi Corp. will maintain positive free cash flow,
balancing adjusted capital and risk-weighted assets. Large investments and share buybacks will reduce the
company's free cash flow in fiscal 2019. However, it will recover to the fiscal 2018 level, as a result of the
company's conservative financial management. Consequently, adjusted capital will be kept in line with the
risk-based capital required under our 'A'' stress scenario.

Business Risk Profile: Strong
We believe Mitsubishi Corp. will continue to post strong profits, leveraging its strong business foundation, which is the
industry's largest. The company's performance is backed by a well-diversified portfolio. Its assets and revenue sources
are geographically diversified across Australia, Asia, Europe, and North and South America, in addition to Japan. We
expect the company to remain competitive in its abilities to partner with other major companies, build business
networks, and gather information globally.
Mitsubishi Corp.'s trading business has a solid customer base, supported by diverse customers and stable business
relationships, including with other Mitsubishi group members. We believe it has a competitive advantage over its peers
in licenses, contracts, and commercial rights; brand reputation and business development skills; and business
infrastructure and capabilities. We expect Mitsubishi Corp. to generate stable earnings from nonresource businesses,
such as automotive, food, industrial finance, logistics and development, and infrastructure. The company's investment
business is slightly smaller in scale and scope than those of major global players in the resource and energy fields.
However, we believe Mitsubishi Corp.'s investment business has stronger strategic investment capabilities in terms of
decision-making on opportunities and divestitures and management of its investment portfolio.

In our view, the importance of appropriate management of the investment portfolio will rise for Mitsubishi Corp. as it
works to maintain stability and profitability. Mitsubishi Corp. operates in diverse fields, providing business support and
sending managers to companies it has invested in, as well as to about 1,400 group companies. Consequently, the
company's investment portfolio has become increasingly complex.
We also recognize Mitsubishi Corp.'s efforts to facilitate stable business operations and better profitability. The
company posted large impairment losses in the resource segment in fiscal 2015, which could not be fully offset by
profits from nonresource businesses. Reflecting on this, it categorized businesses into those sensitive to market
volatility and those that are relatively stable. It is currently working to refine its market risk sensitivity measures.
Mitsubishi Corp. also focuses on areas in which it has advantages, and disposing and withdrawing from businesses in
which it does not have expertise.
However, equity-method affiliate Chiyoda Corp. posted a net loss of ¥214.9 billion in fiscal 2018, because of an
unprofitable overseas plant. Amid increasing uncertainty about the macroeconomic environment, we think it is
increasingly important for Mitsubishi Corp. to further strengthen businesses it considers strategic, enhance its asset
selection, and determine optimal timing for replacing assets.

Mitsubishi Corp.

Financial Risk Profile: Modest
Mitsubishi Corp.'s investment business faces an inherent risk of impairment loss. This is because it continuously makes
large investments and because revenues from resource-related investments are susceptible to commodity market
volatility. Even with growing macroeconomic uncertainty and resource price concerns, we believe the company's solid
business foundation will help generate robust profits in its nonresource segment in the next year or two. This, in turn,
will underpin the company's overall profits.
For fiscal 2019, we expect the company's free cash flow after shareholders rewards, including share buybacks of up to
¥300 billion, to be negative. The company is also likely to spend more in fiscal 2019 than 2018's ¥895.8 billion in new
and maintenance investments. Mitsubishi Corp. has announced it plans to provide ¥160 billion in financial support to
Chiyoda Corp. We think it has become more likely that Mitsubishi Corp. will have to take on additional financial
burdens if Chiyoda Corp.'s performance deteriorates again. The results of efforts to turnaround Chiyoda Corp. are one
of the key elements in our assessment of Mitsubishi Corp.'s creditworthiness.
Mitsubishi Corp. has focused on enhancing its financial standing and has taken steps to recover its risk buffer.
Specifically, it issued subordinated debt and took out subordinated loans totaling ¥600 billion in 2015 and 2016. We
regard the subordinated debt and loans as having intermediate equity content. We believe it is highly likely to maintain
a conservative financial policy under which it aims to enhance free cash flow management, with an eye on balancing
operating cash flow and fresh investments. Thus, in our opinion, it is unlikely that the company's solid financial
foundation will weaken drastically anytime soon.
Mitsubishi Corp.'s adjusted capital is likely to exceed risk-based capital required under our 'A' stress scenario. We base
this view on our expectation that high and steady net profit in the next year or two will expand shareholders' equity.
Mitsubishi Corp.'s ratio of net debt to equity was solid at 0.8x as of the March 31, 2019. We expect the ratio to
continue to improve gradually in the next one to two years. As a result, Mitsubishi Corp.'s level of indebtedness does
not constrain our assessment of its capital adequacy. Accordingly, we continue to assess Mitsubishi Corp.'s capital
adequacy as strong, the second-highest score on a six-point scale.

Profitability
We expect Mitsubishi Corp. to generate at least ¥600 billion in net profit in fiscals 2019 and 2020. We assume resource
prices will remain stable and the company's profits from nonresource businesses will grow steadily, at a moderate
pace. Mitsubishi Corp.'s RORA is likely to move around 15% in the next three years. The RORA is also likely to lag
those of ITOCHU Corp. and Sumitomo Corp., reflecting the company's sizable equity method investments and its
exposure to resource businesses.

Risk position and asset risk management capabilities
Mitsubishi Corp. aims to increase its earnings opportunities through new investments. It also aims to offload
weak-performing investments. Therefore, we think a material increase in the company's annual investments (net basis)
in the next one to two years is unlikely.

Funding And Liquidity
We assess Mitsubishi Corp.'s funding as adequate. Although it has strong, ongoing needs for foreign
currency-denominated funding, we believe it can sufficiently handle these needs. This is because it has the ability to
generate steady operating cash flow. It also has a record of raising foreign currency-denominated funds and it makes
use of foreign exchange hedging. We assume Mitsubishi Corp. will basically cover long-term investments with
long-term financing and place sufficient importance on matching maturities and currencies.
We assess Mitsubishi Corp.'s liquidity as adequate, based on data as of March 31, 2019. We expect Mitsubishi Corp.
will maintain annual liquidity sources of at least 1.1x its uses in the next 12 months. Mitsubishi Corp.'s liquidity is
unlikely to deteriorate significantly, given its strong relationships with major lenders, including Japan's three
megabanks, and its status as a core company within the wider Mitsubishi group.

Environmental, Social, And Governance

We view environmental risk is the most significant environment, social, and governance (ESG) risk for Mitsubishi
Corp. The company invests in large-scale, off-shore resource development projects, including petroleum, natural
gas, iron ore, and coal. The company started to work on divesting coal mine projects in Australia in 2018 and has
sold all interests in fuel coal assets. Mitsubishi Corp. has also been working to increase the proportion of renewable
energy in its power generation business. In its power generation business, it targets a ratio of renewable to all
power generation of at least 20% by 2030 (based on generation volume). Related to this, the company has been
leading the construction of an offshore wind farm. Considering these efforts, we believe environmental risk will
remain largely manageable to Mitsubishi Corp. in the next five years.
In our opinion, social and governance risks are less significant for Mitsubishi Corp. We recognize that both equity
method affiliates and consolidated subsidiaries in the resource development field face the risk of large-scale
accidents due to events such as natural disasters. However, the company's investments are principally in projects
operated by global major players, such as oil majors and large resource development companies. Further, the
company is mostly a minority investor in these projects. However, we consider social risk mitigation to be
important for these investments. We believe the company needs to collaborate with those leading the projects it
has invested in and enhance operation controls. This is an important factor in our credit analysis of Mitsubishi
Corp.
For governance, we consider as Mitsubishi Corp.'s strengths its strategy building process, risk management

Mitsubishi Corp.

Group Companies
Under our group rating methodology, we categorize Mitsubishi Corp.'s two financing arms, Mitsubishi International
Corp. and Mitsubishi Corp. Finance PLC, and New Century Insurance Co. Ltd. as core subsidiaries. We thus equalize
our long-term issuer credit ratings and outlooks on the three subsidiaries with those on Mitsubishi Corp.

Issue Ratings--Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
Mitsubishi Corp.'s consolidated debt consists of unconsolidated bank loans, corporate bonds, and subordinated loans
at the parent level, plus subsidiaries' bank loans and corporate bonds.

Analytical conclusions
We equalize our long-term issue rating on Mitsubishi Corp.'s senior unsecured debt with our long-term issuer credit
rating on the company. This reflects our view that issuers we assess to have a financial risk profile of modest have
leverage low enough to limit the possibility any lenders might be significantly disadvantaged relative to other lenders.
